                <p>The publication <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi>
                    constitutes the official record of the foreign policy of the United States. The
                    volumes in the series include, subject to necessary security considerations, all
                    documents needed to give a comprehensive record of the major foreign policy
                    decisions of the United States together with appropriate materials concerning
                    the facts which contributed to the formulation of policies. Documents in the
                    files of the Department of State are supplemented by papers from other
                    Government agencies involved in the formulation of foreign policy.</p>
                <p>The basic documentary diplomatic record printed in the volumes of the series <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> is edited by the
                    Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, Department of State. The
                    editing is guided by the principles of historical objectivity and in accordance
                    with the following official guidance first promulgated by Secretary of State
                        <persName>Frank B. Kellogg</persName> on March 26, 1925.</p>
                <p>There may be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in
                    the text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                    concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                    policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the
                    following reasons: <list>
                        <label>a.</label>

                        <label>b.</label>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council on
                            the remaining problems to be settled with respect to <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/4, and pointed out that the
                            Secretary of State had just circulated versions of paragraphs 5–g and
                            7–c which were satisfactory to him and which, in the case of paragraph
                            7–c, had been concurred in by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
                        <p>With respect to paragraph 7–c, which dealt with controls on free world
                            trade with Communist China, Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1"
                                >Stassen</persName> inquired whether he was correct in perceiving an
                            indication that some relaxation of these controls might be permissible
                            during the interim period. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied that a decision on this matter must
                            result from a case-by-case appraisal. He said that he did not wish to
                            destroy the good will of our allies, which was necessary if we were to
                            maintain controls on essential strategic items, by too great insistence
                            on the maintenance of controls on less important commodities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> added that according to
                            his interpretation of paragraph 7–c, a certain degree of flexibility was
                            permitted in the interim <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0033"/>period
                            before the Council on Foreign Economic Policy completed its over-all
                            study of East-West trade.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said that he
                            wished to suggest a change in the present language of paragraph 9 of
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, which originally read as
                            follows: “The United States must keep open the possibility of
                            negotiating with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and Communist
                            China acceptable and enforceable agreements, whether limited to
                            individual issues now outstanding or involving a general settlement of
                            major issues.” Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that as written above, the paragraph contained an implication that
                            such agreements might be readily achieved. He doubted very much whether
                            there was any such possibility of achievement, and he therefore
                            concluded that if the above paragraph were to be included at all, it
                            should be changed to reflect the unlikelihood that such agreements could
                            be achieved. We should therefore substitute “should keep an open mind
                            on” for “must keep open”.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary opened the meeting with Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>’s suggestion that an officer be
                            appointed in the Government to deal with the problem of prisoners in
                            Communist China. This officer would be responsible for coordinating
                            action and public statements on all individual cases. The Secretary
                            noted that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>’s suggestion
                            had been concurred in by Secretary of Defense <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> who had offered to have the
                            position established in his Department. The Secretary said that the
                            solution might be two “prisoner officers”, one in the State Department
                            to handle the problem of civilian prisoners, and one in the Defense
                            Department for military prisoners. The latter would clear all policy
                            statements with State, through a State Department adviser. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_KDMK1">Key</persName> agreed to work out with <gloss
                                target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>, and
                            Defense a program along these lines.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then opened the discussion of what practically can be done
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> or by the US to bring about the
                            release of the airmen should the <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> Mission fail. The Secretary suggested that
                            we might get a strong resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> condemning the Chinese Communists. The Secretary added
                            that formalized sanctions, either by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> or by the US, would raise the question of “face” for the
                            Chinese Communists and would not be a successful means to gain release
                            of the airmen. He thought that we might instead resort to taking actions
                            that annoy the Chinese without identifying the motive: they would
                            quickly get the point.</p>
                        <p>There followed a general discussion on the pros and cons of various kinds
                            of aggravating actions which might be taken against the Chinese
                            Communists, including overflights, mining of harbors, and bombing of
                            railroads. The Secretary suggested that junk traffic along the China
                            coast might be intercepted by naval action. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> pointed out that reprisals of
                            this sort might violate international law, as well as the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> raised the question that
                                <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0036"/>the reaction of the Chinese
                            Communists might lead them to use planes and submarines against the
                            intercepting vessels. The Secretary then remarked that he did not think
                            that the Chinese Communists want war. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                >Phleger</persName> said he thought there would be serious doubts of
                            the President’s Constitutional authority to undertake offensive hostile
                            action against the Chinese Communists which might lead into general
                            hostilities with them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            said that punitive action such as the Secretary suggested had not been
                            resorted to even during the Korean hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated his feeling that the best course might be for
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to pass a strongly condemnatory
                            resolution against the Chinese Communists and then leave the matter to
                            the governments concerned, since he felt that we could not get a
                            2/3-vote to favor strong measures by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, and that efforts along these lines might break the
                            organization. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>
                            suggested that the crew of the <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi><note n="5"

                            available intelligence on junk traffic.</p>

                        <p>I had an opportunity after lunch today to discuss the substance of this

                                >Radford</persName>.</p>
                        <p>With the President’s approval, this question will be discussed as a part

                            Thursday, January 13, “U.S. Policy Toward Formosa and the Government of

                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>’s memorandum, I am
                            sending a copy before the Meeting only to you, so as to afford time for

                                    10 January, retaliatory action should be prompt so as to be
                                    related closely in time to the incident which provoked it. The

                                    on the adequacy of Chinese Communist provocation might well
                                    prove to be a bar to timely <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"

                            close door to settlement this issue. It was made clear by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> that if question of release of
                            prisoners could be completely divorced from any political overtones
                            there was possibility of favorable outcome. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> expressed considerable
                            admiration for <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s intellectual
                            and general ability and said that obviously one could not have such long
                            close association without obtaining a certain conviction about a person.
                            He said that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> succeeded in a
                            most difficult role in making clear to him, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>, what he wanted him to understand from the
                            Foreign Policy aspect of this whole matter and yet at the same time gave
                            perhaps a completely different impression for domestic consumption of
                            what had been said and agreed to. One of the most significant statements
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> made was that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> appeared in private
                            conversations to be a very worried man. Toward end of talks <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> appeared to become more human and

                            intend to involve the U.S. in combat action. But matériel and moral
                            support, short of military participation, would be of great
                            psychological value to the Chinese Armed Forces defending the islands.
                            The extent of U.S. support would influence the decision of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> as to whether the Chinese
                            forces should go all out to hold the islands.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government is convinced that the Chinese Communist
                            capabilities for bombing the off-shore islands, using Soviet planes, are
                            constantly increasing, with large scale Soviet tactical and logistic
                            assistance. The scale of the January 10 attack was larger than any
                            Communist air action in the Korean War. The Chinese Government considers
                            the threat to its retention of the off-shore islands is increasing
                            dangerously. This makes it essential that the position of the U.S.
                            Government be made known to the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said this was a
                            matter which would require the consideration of the Secretary. The
                            Secretary had been away all of yesterday and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had been with the <persName

                            all morning. Hence there had not been an opportunity for full
                            consideration of the heavy Communist bombing attack of January 10. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he did
                            not want to say anything definite until he had consulted the Secretary.
                            However, without putting it in the form of a suggestion, he would like
                            to know what the Ambassador thought of placing the matter before the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council. The inquiry need
                            not be relayed to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName>. But for his own background information
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> would like to know
                            what the Ambassador personally thought of such a course of action. Here
                            was an unprovoked attack on territory legitimately held by a <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member. It was an act of aggression which
                            threatened peace and security. Could not a case be made for placing it
                            before the Security Council?</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said this possibility
                            had not been mentioned in the two telegrams on the subject which he had
                            received from his Government. He did not believe his Government was
                            thinking in terms of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. He asked
                            if Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> was thinking of
                            an appeal to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by the Chinese
                            Government, or by some other Government, such as New Zealand?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            question might be raised by any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            member. The Chinese Government could take the action if it wished
                            to.</p>
                        <pb n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0043"/>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his Government
                            would probably consider the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> incapable
                            of deterring Chinese Communist aggression against the off-shore islands.
                            Since a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> appeal would probably be
                            ineffectual, he doubted if his Government would want to give serious
                            consideration to it. He inquired what benefits Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thought might result from
                            putting the matter before the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that in all
                            probability the Soviet Union would feel compelled to veto any resolution
                            which might be considered on the subject. A Soviet veto would greatly
                            improve the international position of the Chinese Government, morally
                            and psychologically, and would put the Communist side in an unfavorable
                            light.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said he felt there was
                            general agreement on the significance of the Tachens from a
                            psychological and political standpoint. There was some disagreement as
                            to the strategic importance of the Tachens from a strictly military
                            standpoint. They were about 200 miles from Formosa and the essentiality
                            of the islands to the military defense of Formosa could be argued. But
                            there was no argument as to their importance from other standpoints.
                            Their loss would undoubtedly be a grave blow to the Chinese Government.
                            A Chinese Communist victory would enhance the prestige of the Communists
                            and embolden them to seize Quemoy and the remaining off-shore islands.
                            All the off-shore islands would be important stepping stones to Formosa
                            and the Pescadores. The inability of the Chinese Government to defend
                            its territory would discredit it among Chinese everywhere and influence
                            many Chinese to go over to the side of the Communists. The momentum
                            gained by the Communists from seizure of the off-shore islands would put
                            them in a favorable position for further aggression.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the matter
                            of the strategic importance of the Tachens was one primarily for
                            military determination as he saw it. We could not commit ourselves to go
                            to war for islands so far from Formosa. However, the type of
                            consultation called for under the Treaty could and should go forward,
                            even though the Treaty was not yet ratified. He assumed that our top
                            military people in the area were already exchanging views with the
                            Chinese military authorities on this subject. We were already assisting
                            the Chinese in the defense of the off-shore islands by providing
                            military hardware and defense support which were used on the islands.
                            Furthermore the garrison on Tachen and other islands had received the
                            benefit of <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> training on Formosa,
                            before being rotated to duty on the islands.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> acknowledged that
                            American assistance was being made available indirectly for the defense
                            of the off-shore islands. However he did not understand that our <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> officers were primarily responsible
                            for consulting with and advising the Chinese military on strategic and
                            combat questions. He thought they were in Formosa <pb n="16"
                                xml:id="pg_16" facs="0044"/>primarily for training purposes and
                            their advisory role was chiefly in the training field.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> as the Commander
                            in Chief of the Pacific Fleet had top U.S. military responsibility in
                            the area and was certainly authorized to advise and recommend in the
                            strategic field.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> recognized this fact but
                            mentioned that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> had
                            a vast area to cover and was able to visit Formosa and adjacent areas
                            only infrequently.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> then said that his
                            Government had five requests to make of the U.S. Government as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>That the U.S. Government make an official statement on the
                                    Communist assault on the Tachen Islands, expressing its concern
                                    at this aggressive action and indicating its sympathy with the
                                    Chinese Government in its defense of the islands. He said that
                                    the silence of the U.S. Government so far on this act of
                                    aggression was noticeable. It was felt that a statement along
                                    the lines suggested would tend to keep the Communists guessing
                                    as to whether we would assist in the defense of the islands, and
                                    would therefore have something of a deterrent effect on the
                                    Communists, and a favorable psychological effect on the Chinese
                                    Government troops defending the islands.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>That the U.S. Government assign a fully empowered high ranking
                                    military official to Taipei as a consultant. A role more or less
                                    corresponding to that of General

                                    some distance off. If they stood closer in they would seem to
                                    show more of an interest in the defense of the Tachens, and
                                    without becoming involved in hostilities themselves, could exert
                                    a useful influence.</item>

                                    support for the defense of the off-shore islands. He mentioned
                                    that the consumption rate for matériel and supplies already was
                                    greatly stepped up, and probably would be further accelerated as
                                    the tempo of hostilities rose. He mentioned that in the single
                                    day of January 10, three vessels had been lost or put out of
                                    commission. One aircraft had been lost and large quantities of
                                    ammunition expended. If the Chinese Forces had the certainty of
                                    strong U.S. logistic support, this knowledge would give a lift
                                    to their morale.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>That the U.S. Government accelerate the delivery of matériel
                                    and supplies already scheduled under the Military Assistance
                                    Program:—especially jet aircraft, the 4 destroyers recently
                                    requested, and a number of <gloss target="#t_LST1"

                                    both aircraft and naval vessels was expected to rise as a result

                        <p>[Here follows a summary of the first portion of the intelligence
                            briefing, given by Director of Central Intelligence <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen W. Dulles</persName>, and related discussion
                            concerning Costa Rica.]</p>
                        <p>At the close of this discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen
                                Dulles</persName> resumed his briefing with comments on the attack
                            by the Chinese Communists on the Tachen Islands, which he described as
                            the heaviest action by the Communists against the Nationalists since the
                            attacks on <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0046"/>Quemoy in September.
                            Between 60 and 100 Chinese Communist aircraft had participated in the
                            attack on the Tachens, and the engagement had lasted nine or ten hours.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> believed that the
                            Chinese Nationalists had been caught somewhat unprepared for the attack,
                            which indicated to him good Communist intelligence with respect to the
                            rotation of Chinese Nationalist troops in the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was inclined to
                            disagree with the view that the Nationalists had been caught off guard.
                            He indicated, however, that they had lost one <gloss target="#t_LST1"
                                >LST</gloss> and that another <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>,
                            as well as a Nationalist gunboat, had been severely damaged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> resumed by
                            pointing out the serious morale effect on the Nationalist garrisons in
                            the Tachen Islands if the Chinese Communist attacks were to continue.
                            Continuation of the attacks would also present the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> with the problem of
                            determining whether or not to engage a considerable sector of the
                            Nationalist armed forces to defend the Tachen Islands.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> interposed to
                            state that the situation in the Tachens was currently such that they
                            could not be held by the Nationalists if the Chinese Communists
                            succeeded in interdicting the supply lines between Formosa and the
                            Tachens. The answer to this problem appeared to be an increase in the
                            number of F–86 aircraft delivered to the Nationalists by the United
                            States. The United States has already provided a certain number of
                            F–86’s. General <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName>, said
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, was of the
                            opinion that it was possible to speed up the delivery of other F–86’s so
                            that they could be on hand before April 15, after which date the
                            Nationalists believe that the real Chinese Communist effort to take the
                            Tachens can be expected. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> also thought that it would be advantageous from
                            the point of view of the United States if the Chinese Nationalists were
                            successful in producing attrition of the Chinese Communist Air Force.
                            Beyond that, the delivery of an additional wing of F–86’s would enable
                            the Chinese Nationalists to run an effective air patrol over the Tachen
                            Islands on those days in which there were concentrations of vessels in
                            the port.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> also indicated
                            the desire of the Chinese Nationalists for eight additional <gloss
                                target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>’s. He advised that these vessels could
                            and should be sent if the United States desires that the Chinese
                            Nationalists hold on to the Tachen Islands. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> concluded by stating that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1">Chase</persName> had informed him
                            that the defenses of the Tachen Islands were very strong, and that the
                            problem of resupply was the real key to the situation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> briefed the Council at

                            of a miracle inasmuch as it had been approved without change by the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff and contained no split views by the members of the

                        <p>Before the Council began its consideration of this policy paper, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he wished to call
                            their attention to a story in <hi rend="italic">The New York Times</hi>
                            of January 12 which described a private memorandum which had been
                            circulated to members of the Congress by the Democratic National
                            Committee and which questioned the wisdom of Senate ratification of the
                            mutual defense treaty with the Formosa government. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then read the chief points made
                            by this memorandum. In the first place, the memorandum argued that
                            ratification of the treaty would for the first time constitute a formal
                            recognition of Formosa and the Pescadores as territories of the Republic
                            of China. Secondly, such formal recognition would support the claim of
                            the Chinese Communists that an armed attack on Formosa and the
                            Pescadores would not constitute international aggression on their part,
                            but only civil war, in which the right and purpose of other nations
                            forcibly to intervene would be open to serious doubt. In conclusion, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he thought the
                            matter serious, and would like to have the Secretary of State comment.
                            The President said that by all means Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> should comment.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary of State said that the memorandum which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had read did indeed indicate an
                            “interesting development”. He would prefer, however, to defer discussion
                            of it until the Vice President (who had momentarily left the meeting)
                            could be present.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested
                            that the Council look at paragraph 11 of the present paper, because this
                            paragraph posed a certain problem. Paragraph 11 read as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">

                                    judged adequate in each case by the President.”</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> explained that the
                            recent attack by the Chinese Communists against the Tachen Islands had
                            provided the first test of the adequacy of the policy set forth in this
                            paragraph. A memorandum to him from the Chief of Naval Operations<note
                                n="10" xml:id="d9fn10">See the attachment to <ref target="#d6"
                                    >Document 6</ref>.</note> had raised the question as to the
                            validity of current instructions to the Commander-in-Chief of the US.
                            Fleet in the Pacific. There was some question as to whether Chinese
                            Nationalist retaliatory action was to be considered offensive action in
                            the sense of paragraph 11. Furthermore, if paragraph 11 were to be
                            construed in a manner to permit the Chinese Nationalists to engage in
                            retaliatory action against the Chinese Communist mainland, so much time
                            would be consumed in obtaining the judgment of the President that the
                            retaliatory character of Chinese Nationalist action would not be
                            apparent. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> ended by
                            indicating <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"/>to the Council the
                            President’s view, when he was briefed for this meeting, that a
                            distinction should be made between offensive actions which were in
                            retaliation for Chinese Communist attacks, and other kinds of offensive
                            action, and that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> should
                            exercise his own best judgment with respect to the mounting of
                            retaliatory actions by the Chinese Nationalists. Accordingly, said Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, he had prepared for
                            Council consideration a revision of paragraph 11 of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5441, as well as a revision of

                            reflected the President’s view. He noted that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            had likewise presented a revision of these paragraphs. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on the Secretary of
                            State for his opinion of the proposed revision of these two
                            paragraphs.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            no objection in principle to the revised language presented by Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>. However, he too had

                            this memorandum on the mutual defense treaty. This memorandum was
                            plainly designed to obfuscate the issues and to throw monkey wrenches
                            into the Administration’s plans. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then went on to
                            express with some indignation his fear that the memorandum in question
                            would spearhead organized opposition to the ratification of the mutual
                            defense treaty in the United States Senate. The President inquired
                            whether it would not be well to prepare a statement to meet the issues
                            raised by the Democratic memorandum, and perhaps get someone like
                            Senator <persName>Mansfield</persName><note n="19" xml:id="d9fn19"
                                >Senator <persName>Mike Mansfield</persName> of Montana.</note> to
                            make it public. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            agreed that it would be wise not to let too much time pass before
                            countering the points raised in the memorandum.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President inquired, what forum? Perhaps the Senate Foreign
                            Relations Committee. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> expressed the opinion that a public meeting of
                            that Committee would be a logical place, adding that he would first,
                            however, have a private conversation with Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName>, who had known about the treaty
                            from its inception. <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0051"/>Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said that in his
                            opinion the activities of the group which had written this memorandum
                            bordered on the traitorous—at a time when our national security policies
                            were faced with such severe difficulties.</p>
                        <p>The President said to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> that he saw no reason why it was necessary to
                            forego the possibility of a public statement because the Secretary
                            desired to deal directly with Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1"
                                >George</persName> or Senator <persName>Mansfield</persName>. The
                            best plan was to show these two what Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> intended to say at a public
                            hearing. Indeed, one of these two Senators might well be induced to
                            denounce the activities of this cabal at the time when we most
                            desperately needed bi-partisan support of our foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President observed that it was obvious to him that this whole
                            thing was a calculated political maneuver. Much the same technique had
                            been used to criticize the President’s State of the Union message, only
                            in this case the group elected to leak the criticism to the press
                            instead of coming out with a direct public statement. The Vice President
                            went on to state that whoever was selected to make public reference to
                            this breach of bi-partisanship, it should certainly not be either the
                            President or the Secretary of State. Perhaps the best thing would be for
                            some Senator who was not involved, or some well-known press figure, to
                            make the statement.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in any
                            event the first thing for him to do was to talk to Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName>.</p>

                            Tachen to interdiction by air. If island were isolated this fashion and

                            Communists like ripe apple. This would be contrary our interests which
                            would seem require that if island falls it be only as result military
                            assault and after strong defense, otherwise why have we consistently

                                        Geneva Conference. Two meetings had been held subsequently
                                        at the staff level, and, after the conclusion of the Geneva
                                        Conference, five meetings at the consular level had taken
                                        place in Geneva, the most recent on November 29, 1954. Lists

                                    not include Downey and Fecteau, which made the Chinese
                                    suspicious. And the fact that at Geneva we did not object to
                                    their statement that they were going to try all these people
                                    confirmed their idea.</item>

                        <p>It was the general political situation, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> believes, which led the Chinese to treat
                            the American cases different from the Canadian and other cases, but
                            there is no doubt in <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                            >Hammarskjold</persName>’s mind that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> never expected the reaction which occurred in the
                            United Nations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> feels that he has
                            clarified all of the points concerning the prisoners. He said several
                            times “the medicine is in the body; their suspicions are dispelled; our
                            arguments are understood and respected”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> made a statement that “our
                            views cannot be reconciled”, but he only made it once and that was on a
                            pro forma basis. Our views were presented orally and in writing to
                            him.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> says the United States used
                            this “spy issue” to stir up an uproar in order to take attention away
                            from the United States-<persName>Chiang</persName> Treaty. It was clear
                            to <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> said this for propaganda
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>What really impressed <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            was that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> appeared to use
                            every means to avoid tying his hands negatively for the future.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said this was
                            particularly marked in connection with the fact that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> did not want to overstate his case
                            in the communiqué. He “avoided everything to make it more difficult for
                            him to release the prisoners in the future.”</p>
                        <p>At their last meeting <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            flatly told <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>—and it seemed to
                            annoy him—that he should release the prisoners.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0056"/>
                        <p>To that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> said, in <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s words, that “he
                            definitely wanted the possibility of releasing the prisoners but it must
                            be in such a way as not to make him lose face in Asia”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> then suggested to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> that he could do it on
                            the basis of good behavior. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>
                            said he liked that idea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said “my personal
                            conviction is that he will do it”.</p>
                        <p>When I asked what the next move should be, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> said “lie low. This thing must above all be
                            worked out in his own mind”.</p>
                        <p>There was, said <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>, never
                            at any time any hint of bargaining or of direct negotiations with the
                            United States. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> is not at all
                            interested in the Chinese students from a trading viewpoint. He has a
                            long list of grudges and the students are on that list but he does not
                            want to use them to trade with.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> thinks that we should
                            strive together to create a situation in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> will work out a solution in his own
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>I said, “in other words, we must arrange it so that newspapermen will not
                            act as newspapermen and that Senators will not act like Senators”.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> and
                                <persName>Waldock</persName> smiled rather ruefully at that, and
                                <persName>Waldock</persName> said that that was about it.</p>
                        <p>I said, “Can’t we give some hope, can’t we hold out some definite promise
                            of some kind?”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said this thing must
                            look spontaneous. He pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> had said that the four had not been convicted and
                            that he differentiated the four jet pilots very definitely from the
                            eleven. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said that he
                            looked for prompt action on the four and that he was absolutely positive
                            that Downey and Fecteau were safe. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> that the death sentence was completely
                            justified for both Downey and Fecteau but he said “they will come back
                            home one day”. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> is
                            sure that the four will not be convicted.</p>
                        <p>He said that the fifteen aviators were in prison in Peking and that
                            Downey and Fecteau were in prison in the northeast. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> has photographs and
                            documentary material concerning all the prisoners which he is going to
                            furnish us. He also has a confidential report which he is going to send
                            to us in addition to the official report which he will make to all
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> offered visas to the members
                            of the families of all of the seventeen—that is, the 11 B–29 men, the 4
                            jet pilots and Downey and Fecteau—to come to visit them and to see for
                            themselves how well they were treated. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> said that he would give visas to the families of
                            the 66 whose names were on the list at Geneva and said that this would
                            have to be worked out with the US Consul General in Geneva.</p>

                            trip was a beginning. He feels that his visit has put our prisoners in a
                            very protected position and that they are as safe as men could be at the

                                >Hammarskjold</persName> wanted the words “in the meantime”
                            inserted. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> objected and wanted
                            the words “in the spirit of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Charter” inserted. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            objected to this because he felt that it might be regarded as
                            constituting de facto recognition. The result was that the first
                            sentence in the communiqué which mentioned the prisoner issue by
                            reference was <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s and
                            that the second sentence contained phrases which <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> wanted. These were: “at the same
                            time”, and “pertinent questions”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said these were purely
                            face-saving words because 90 per cent of the 16 hours that he spent with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> was on prisoners of war.
                            He said that for face-saving reasons <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> could not admit of any questioning of the Chinese
                            courts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s main grudge, according to
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>, was certain
                            clauses in the treaty with <persName>Chiang</persName>, that guarantees
                            could be extended to other areas. This <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> interprets as referring not only to the islands but
                            to the mainland.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s only reference to the
                            confessions was at the end and was incidental. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> is sure that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> does not want to make it too
                            difficult to release the prisoners.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> is much impressed with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s intelligence. He says
                            he has certain marks of greatness and also of ruthlessness. He said that
                            he referred to him at the Tokyo airport as having the manners of a
                            “grand seigneur”, and that the Swedish Minister at Tokyo said, “yes, but
                            a grand seigneur from the early renaissance”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> feels that there was
                            no alternative to having him go, that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> ignored the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            resolution all the time, but justified his conversations with <persName

                                The President felt we should perhaps plan to deliver the packages
                                with the film personally, asking perhaps one or more Defense
                                officers to call to see the next of kin and perhaps to dissuade them
                                from trying to go to China. He felt that even if they do go to
                                China, we should not issue passports to the newspapermen.</item>

                            attack on little island off coast of Formosa. Only caution Pres.
                            observes is that we must not commit ourselves to point of encouraging
                            attack. He thinks it would be perfectly well to say that this island
                            lies at such a distance, &amp; is of such little importance, that we
                            could not view this with any great concern. In otherwords, it is not a
                            matter of significance &amp; would not affect vital interests of Formosa
                            or ourselves.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> gave its location: About 10
                            statute miles north of the northern [most] Tachen Island; about 4 miles
                            from a Communist-held island; about 12 miles off the coast. It is over
                            200 miles north of Formosa, &amp; really quite an indefensible position.
                            It is not held by regular forces of the nationalist “guerrillas”—is part
                            of a group where there has been a pretty steady attrition for some time.
                            Pres. feels we could say it’s a skirmish of no significance

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he had an
                            important message in regard to the Tachen Islands which he was
                            instructed to deliver to the Secretary. From a strictly military
                            standpoint none of the off-shore islands could be held by the Chinese
                            forces unaided. The off-shore island positions were untenable if the
                            Chinese Government had to depend exclusively on its own resources.
                            However it was not purely a military problem. There were other important
                            considerations in regard to which he wished to consult the
                            Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government did not want the impression to get out that its
                            forces were unwilling to defend their territory. His Government <pb
                                n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>was fully aware of the bad effect
                            which any such impression would have. It would encourage the enemies of
                            Free China in the U.S. and elsewhere to make the old allegation all over
                            again:—the Chinese Nationalists were afraid to fight and when challenged
                            would throw away their arms and surrender. The Chinese Government had
                            been trying to refute this charge by proving that they do have the will
                            to fight. It has been pretty well refuted on Quemoy where 8,000
                            Communists have been killed and 7,000 taken prisoner in the course of
                            the repulse of various Communist assaults since 1949. The Chinese troops
                            on the Tachens, as elsewhere, are determined to fight. If any of them
                            must be withdrawn, it would be necessary to plan carefully in advance,
                            to minimize the adverse psychological effect.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government has always wanted to include the off-shore islands
                            in security arrangements with the U.S. When the U.S. found it impossible
                            to include the off-shore islands in the Treaty area, the Chinese
                            Government had urged a demonstration of force by the 7th Fleet, or at
                            least the inclusion of the off-shore islands area in the routine patrols
                            of the 7th Fleet. Unfortunately for the last few days all units of the
                            7th Fleet have given the Tachen Islands a wide berth. They have stayed
                            farther away than usual. This creates an impression of abandonment. He
                            also expressed a hope that officials of the U.S. Government would
                            refrain from making statements which implied the possibility of
                            abandonment and minimized the lack of strategic importance of the
                            islands. Such statements were encouraging to the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Government believed that if the U.S. would indicate a
                            positive interest in the retention of the off-shore islands by the
                            Chinese Government, following up a public statement with “suggestive
                            action”, a strong deterrent influence would be exercised on the Chinese
                            Communists. The present situation is dangerous for the U.S. as well as
                            for his Government. The Chinese forces cannot stand idly by and become
                            sitting ducks. They have to hit back against the sources of the
                            Communist attacks, which are on the Mainland. Already the Chinese
                            Government forces have started air bombing of the Communist bases on the
                            Mainland from which the attacks on the Tachens have been launched. If
                            the reciprocal attacks and counter attacks of the two sides continue,
                            the area of involvement almost certainly will become enlarged with
                            growing danger for all concerned. The Communists will probably feel
                            compelled to respond to the attacks on their Mainland bases with counter
                            attacks on the Chinese Government air bases, which are on Formosa and
                            the Pescadores. Communist bombing of Formosa and the Pescadores would
                            probably involve the U.S. Hence the safest course from the U.S.
                            standpoint would be for the off-shore islands to be included in the 7th
                            Fleet patrol area. This might stabilize the situation. The Chinese <pb
                                n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0068"/>Government knows that the U.S.
                            Government has the capability of deterring the Communists and
                            stabilizing the situation. The question is whether the U.S. is prepared
                            to take such action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the U.S. Government could not afford to bluff in this
                            situation. We cannot indicate that we may intervene unless we are in
                            fact prepared to do so. It would be disastrous if we made statements and
                            then failed to follow through. We must not give any warning which might
                            prove to be empty. Even if the U.S. were at war with Communist China, it
                            probably would not be militarily sound to hold the Tachen Islands. They
                            are too close to the Communist held Mainland and too far from our air
                            bases. It would be necessary to provide air cover from a carrier. It
                            would not make any military sense to tie up a major unit of our fleet
                            and its protecting vessels in order to defend a rocky islet of no
                            strategic importance. It would not be productive. The continuous
                            provision of air cover would actually tie up two of our major carriers
                            since they would have to be rotated. This would be half of the carriers
                            available in the Far East. It is most unlikely that they could be
                            spared. It may be necessary to consider the evacuation of the Tachens,
                            to avoid the heavy drain on Chinese Government resources now taking
                            place. It is understood that 2 <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>s were
                            lost in the recent raid. It was a question how long that rate of
                            attrition could be afforded.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary was inclined to think that a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> approach might be advisable. If it did not result in a
                            cease-fire, it might at least place the Chinese Government in a stronger
                            moral position. It was probably too late for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action to save the Tachens. The Secretary asked if the
                            Foreign Minister considered Quemoy the only other island of
                            importance?</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said he would also include Matsu.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had the impression it was not very important.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that Matsu was more or less a northern anchor
                            for the Chinese Government position in the Formosa Strait. It was about
                            as far from Keelung as was Quemoy from Kaoh-siung. He felt that the
                            strategic importance of all the islands was more or less relative,
                            depending on the situation and on other positions which were held. If
                            the Tachens were lost, Matsu would become more important. He felt that
                            some island position north of Quemoy was needed. The Tachens were
                            extremely useful for radar tracking and for intelligence operations. The
                            Chinese Government could communicate with its agents on the Mainland
                            from the Tachens. It was possible to keep track of Communist shipping as
                            far north as Shanghai from the Tachens. They were a very useful northern
                            outpost. Otherwise the Chinese Government would not have expended so
                            much effort and money in fortifying and maintaining <pb n="41"
                                xml:id="pg_41" facs="0069"/>them. In time of war it would be very
                            valuable. In Communists hands it would assume a new importance and would
                            represent an added threat to Chinese and U.S. positions.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that the disparity in distances made the Tachen
                            position untenable. It was only 60 miles from airfields on the Mainland,
                            against 220 miles from airfields on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister asked if the 7th Fleet could not be instructed to
                            operate as usual in the vicinity of the Tachens. He said that for the
                            past 11 days they had “avoided the area like poison”. He saw no point in
                            this. It represented a conspicuous departure from previous practice.
                            Naturally the Chinese Commanders on Tachen felt let down by the apparent
                            American pullout. He felt there was no real danger in the 7th Fleet
                            vessels adhering to their normal patrol routes. He was sure the
                            Communists were too smart to attack American Naval vessels.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister referred to one of the requests delivered by
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> to Assistant
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> on Jan.

                                    8</ref>.</note> namely, that a U.S. civilian or military
                            official of high rank and wide authority be assigned to Formosa as a
                            consultant and expediter. Someone who would have the power to make
                            decisions on the spot, and who would have direct access to the key
                            people in Washington was envisaged.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that we had General <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1"
                                >Chase</persName> in Taipei.</p>
                        <p>Both the Foreign Minister and the Ambassador said that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMGWC1">Chase</persName> lacked the rank and the
                            authority which they considered necessary. They had in mind someone at a
                            higher level who would fill a role of greater responsibility.</p>
                        <p>At this point the conversation was interrupted. It was agreed that the
                            Foreign Minister and the Ambassador would return in the afternoon for a
                            resumption of the conversation.</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and I lunched
                            with the President at my suggestion. I told the President that I was
                            becoming increasingly concerned <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0070"
                            />at the situation developing in the Far East out of the strongly
                            mounted and effective <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> attacks
                            on Nationalist held islands. It is now apparent that these islands could
                            not be held without US interposition. Also it seemed to me apparent that
                            doubt as to our intentions was having a bad effect on our prestige in
                            the area, since it was in many quarters assumed that we would defend the
                            islands, and our failure to do so indicated that we were running away
                            when actual danger appeared. I felt it important to make our intentions
                            clear and then stick to them. I furthermore said that I doubted it was
                            practical at this time to announce our abandonment of them all because
                            this would be such a shock to the Republic of China that they might turn
                            against us. There [<hi rend="italic">They</hi>?] were now asking
                            insistently for assurances of military support. The Chinese Foreign
                            Minister had just called upon me this morning. I said I had been giving
                            the matter considerable thought for several days and was of the opinion
                            that we should probably now modify our <gloss target="#t_NSC1"

                                    action. Pending the ratification of such a Treaty, continue the

                                    Pescadores (excluding the Nationalist-held off-shore islands).
                                    For the present, seek to preserve, through United Nations
                                    action, the status quo of the Nationalist held off-shore
                                    islands; and, without committing U.S. forces except as
                                    militarily desirable in the event of Chinese Communist attack on
                                    Formosa and the Pescadores, provide to the Chinese Nationalist
                                    forces military equipment and training to assist them to defend
                                    such off-shore islands, using Formosa as a base. However, do not

                                    Communist China which are prompt and clear retaliation against a

                                    targets of military significance which meet U.S. criteria as to
                                    feasibility and chance of success and which are selected with
                                    due consideration for the undesirability of provoking further

                            the islands in the Tachen area and to help them to do so, as otherwise
                            evacuation would be impossible. I felt that we should probably, however,
                            indicate our intention to hold Quemoy, which from the standpoint of air
                            was more defensible than the Tachens and also served a more valuable
                            military purpose than the Tachens. I did not know whether the same
                            considerations applied to the Matsu group. I said I thought we should

                                various developments, including the U.S. decision to negotiate the

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he was
                            in strong agreement, that the time had come when we should make our
                            position absolutely clear and also make sure that it “stuck”. He would
                            have favored holding all the offshore islands, but was prepared to
                            compromise on the basis I suggested.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his general agreement with our line of thought.
                            He asked how I would propose to proceed. I said there were three points
                            which needed to be touched. One was the Republic of China, and I could
                            see the Chinese Foreign Minister this afternoon. The other was the
                            British Ambassador, whom I expected to see, and the third was the
                            Congressional leadership. I suggested the President should have a
                            meeting with the Congressional leaders. The President, after some
                            reflection, indicated he thought it might be better for me to meet with
                            them in the first instance with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> to get a feeling of the situation. He suggested
                            I should do so the next morning.</p>
                        <p>Following the luncheon, I dictated the enclosed as a hasty memorandum of
                            what I conceived to be the decisions provisionally arrived at.</p>

                                189–190.</note> The Secretary replied that he didn’t feel very happy
                            about it. He said that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> had told him that his intellect indicated
                            to him that the situation of the fliers looked bad but that his instinct
                            made him hopeful. The Secretary said that his own impression was that
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> had made no
                            progress at all. He referred to the Communist offer of visas for the
                            prisoners’ families and then showed <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> a <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> photograph
                            which showed <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> under a
                                <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0073"/>sign in Peking in Chinese
                            which was a bitter denunciation of United States aggression in
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> then inquired what
                            happens next in the matter and the Secretary said that it would be our
                            effort to try to keep matters stable as long as we could.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that a tentative decision had been reached to
                            take certain actions designed to stabilize the situation. He had seen
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> at noon
                            and would see him again later in the day for the purpose of encouraging
                            the Nationalists to evacuate the Tachen Islands. For the U.S. to
                            effectively defend the Tachens would involve the use of air and sea
                            power out of proportion to their strategic value. At the same time in
                            order to avoid a loss of morale on Formosa it was contemplated to state
                            that under present conditions the United States would assist the
                            Nationals in the defense of Quemoy. They are important to the defense of
                            Formosa and it remains the avowed Communist purpose to take Formosa.
                            Such action would be subject to <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action
                            or any cease fire or similar measure which might develop as a result of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. The Secretary said that he
                            felt it was time now to initiate <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d18fn4"><hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> was a code
                                name for the proposed New Zealand initiative in the <gloss

                            also the need for Congressional action along the lines of a resolution
                            with respect to our purposes regarding Quemoy. He was meeting early the
                            next morning with the President on this matter and he hoped the British
                            would give us their support.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> inquired if the effect
                            of such action on our part would be to bring Quemoy within the scope of
                            the Treaty. The Secretary replied negatively, saying that our action
                            would be provisional pending <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action
                            or, alternatively, the Communists using Amoy as a clear staging base for
                            the invasion of Formosa. It was not contemplated that this would be a
                            permanent extension of the Treaty area. All of this, of course, was
                            dependent upon the action by the Chinese Nationals.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> inquired if our
                            assistance in the withdrawal from the Tachens would not involve the risk
                            of hostilities breaking out there.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that the risk existed and said if we were shot at we
                            would obviously shoot back. The Nationals, however, of course might
                            refuse to evacuate the Tachens. In any event, he felt Oracle should be
                            activated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> asked if we had talked
                            to the New Zealand Ambassador and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said he had just talked to him on this

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> stated that the

                                “explosive” and that he thought the proposed New Zealand initiative
                                “would now be most timely.” (Department of State, Central Files,

                        <p>The Secretary noted that all of this would have a bad effect on the
                            release of our airmen.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> asked what our thought
                            was on timing. The Secretary gave no clear indication other than that we
                            should move rapidly. The Nationalists presumably would announce that
                            they were regrouping and we would say that we were assisting them in
                            this until a cease fire was achieved by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                        <p>The Secretary said that he would state a position which the President was
                            prepared to consider if it was acceptable to the Chinese Government: <list>

                                    months:—namely, call on Communist China, and presumably other
                                    countries, to cease military activities in the area of the
                                    Off-shore Islands.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he believed that the announcement as to the protection
                            of Quemoy would largely offset the adverse morale factor <pb n="47"
                                xml:id="pg_47" facs="0075"/>involved in a withdrawal from the
                            Tachens. The action could be represented as a regrouping designed to
                            concentrate the Chinese Government forces in more tenable positions. It
                            could be held out as a trimming down operation. It could be emphasized
                            that China and the U.S. will stand shoulder to shoulder in a
                            consolidated position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we could not count on concrete Security Council
                            action as a result of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> initiative.
                            A Soviet veto would have to be anticipated. A Communist veto should
                            enable the Chinese Government to command a greater degree of
                            international support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the President considered that a Joint Resolution
                            of Congress would be required, since we would have to be prepared if
                            necessary to engage in hostilities with Communist China. We might find
                            it necessary to strike at Communist positions on the Mainland. Such
                            action could not be taken without Congressional authority. He had
                            arranged a meeting with leaders of both Houses of Congress tomorrow
                            morning January 20. He would point out that the Administration considers
                            it necessary that Quemoy be held by the Chinese Government. The port of
                            Amoy, which was commanded by the island of Quemoy, would be an ideal
                            staging ground for an invasion of Formosa if its effective use was not
                            denied to the Communists. This would justify provisional action by the
                            U.S. of the nature contemplated. It was a grave step which might lead to
                            war with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>As to Matsu, the Chinese Government would have to decide whether to try
                            to hold it. The Secretary said his strong advice would be to pull out.
                            It could be done under cover of the Tachen operation. If the Chinese
                            Government endeavored to hold on to Matsu, it would be eventually
                            snapped off. The U.S. could not extend its coverage to Matsu and the
                            position was not believed to be defensible. A good concentration and
                            balance of Chinese forces could be achieved between Formosa, the
                            Pescadores and Quemoy. Any additional off-shore island positions would
                            represent an over-extension of Chinese Government forces. Other
                            positions could not be held without an expenditure of resources out of
                            relation to the value of such positions. It did not make sense to tie up
                            major forces to hold a bunch of rocks. The U.S. was not prepared to make
                            any commitment apart from Quemoy. On the other hand, it was realized
                            that if all the off-shore island positions were abandoned there would be
                            a very bad effect on morale throughout the Far East. The question was,
                            what do you do to offset the effect of withdrawal from some of the
                            positions? We would join forces to hold a reduced position, giving up
                            the untenable positions which over-extend available Chinese forces.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if
                            the President proposed to accomplish this by Executive Order and not
                            under the Treaty?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this was correct.</p>
                        <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0076"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said presumably the
                            Chinese Government would announce a regrouping operation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that concerted action would be required. Presumably
                            the Chinese Government would announce its intention to regroup, saying
                            that it would no longer endeavor to hold those positions which were of
                            no vital strategic significance, and would concentrate its forces on
                            Formosa, the Pescadores and Quemoy. Probably the U.S. would announce
                            that without awaiting the ratification of the Treaty, the U.S. would
                            take interim action to assure the security of Quemoy, which was
                            considered essential to the protection of Formosa and the Pescadores.
                            “Security” in this context had a broad connotation. It would mean that
                            either U.S. Forces or Chinese forces would be empowered to attack a
                            build-up on the Mainland which seemed to be aimed at Quemoy, Formosa and
                            the Pescadores. We would not have to wait for an actual attack.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he would
                            communicate the U.S. proposals at once to his Government. Meanwhile he
                            hoped that the Secretary would make every effort to keep the subject sub
                            rosa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would urge the Congressmen to maintain secrecy. He
                            would do this with all the earnestness at his command.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that even if his
                            Government accepted the kind offer just outlined, it would require
                            considerable planning and preparation. There would have to be an
                            effective pretense of maintaining normal conditions while the
                            preparations went forward.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed, and said he thought that the U.S. would be prepared
                            to send forces into the Tachen area to protect it pending the
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action after the evacuation was
                            contemplated? Would the Tachens in effect be given to the
                            Communists?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said this was correct.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said if his Government
                            accepted, it would be necessary to make plans in advance, and move very
                            rapidly in the execution of the plans.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought the Joint Resolution might require two or
                            three days’ debate in Congress, perhaps more. The matter might be
                            referred to Committees of Congress. The Secretary knew that Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> was extremely
                            reluctant to take any action which might lead to war with Communist
                            China. He wanted our commitments limited strictly to Formosa and the
                            Pescadores. The Secretary did not know whether Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> and the rest of the Democratic
                            leadership of the two Houses would go along. The Democrats controlled
                            Congress. Strong bipartisan support of the proposal by the Congress and
                            the American people would be a necessity.</p>
                        <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0077"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if the Secretary
                            could defer his consultations with Congress until he had time to hear
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not think so. He said it was necessary to begin
                            to educate the members of Congress. He would not define the
                            Administration proposal so clearly in his conversation with the
                            Congressional leaders tomorrow. But he wanted to get their reaction to
                            the basic questions. He wanted to begin to crystalize the issues and the
                            thinking. The President would probably present the detailed proposal
                            later. The Secretary thought the situation was so acute that we could
                            not afford to wait.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he thought he
                            could get an answer in six hours or so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would make it clear that the proposed course of
                            action requires the concurrence of the Chinese Government. The U.S.
                            would of course want to consider the ideas of the Chinese Government. As
                            to substance, the proposal was very much in the interest of the Chinese
                            Government. If the Chinese Government rejected the proposal, it would
                            lose the whole business.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that in order to maintain our own self respect, we
                            could not play a fuzzy game any longer. That game was played out. The
                            Chinese Communists had already begun to probe and were exposing the
                            indecision. The U.S. must now make clear its position and be prepared to
                            carry out the obligations it was now prepared to assume. Otherwise the
                            U.S. reputation would become tarnished. The U.S. could not afford to
                            back down from any position which it assumed, or to be exposed in a
                            bluff. We must decide how far our interests require us to go and then we
                            must deliver on our commitments. As he saw it there were three choices:
                            to try to hold all the off-shore islands; to disclaim responsibility for
                            any of the off-shore islands which would result in the eventual loss of
                            all of them; or to concentrate on Quemoy as the closest and most
                            important, and hold it. This third choice was so much better than the
                            others that there was no real choice. The problem was with Congress. We
                            must begin to educate Congress as to the requirements of the present
                            situation. Of course the talks would not commit the Chinese Government,
                            nor would they be so definite as this conversation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said it was hard to persuade soldiers to die in a hopeless
                            cause. He thought it was questionable whether the garrison on the
                            Tachens would fight if they had no hope. He supposed they would fight if
                            they could be sure of support which would give them hope. He did not
                            doubt the strong will to fight of the Chinese forces if they had
                            assurances of adequate backing.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he was very happy
                            to know that the U.S. Government had come to a definite decision. He
                            agreed that fuzziness had existed for too long. Although the Chinese
                            military capabilities were <pb n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0078"/>very
                            limited, the decision was a difficult one, which the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> could not make alone. The
                            President of the Executive Yuan (the Premier) would be consulted, and
                            probably a secret session of the Cabinet would be convened. He did not
                            say the proposition would be rejected, but the matter was one of great
                            moment and considerable delicacy. He agreed that the Tachens had only
                            limited strategic value for the Chinese Government. But if they fell to
                            the Chinese Communists, he felt they would have a far greater strategic
                            significance for the Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed some doubt about this, pointing out that no
                            airfields could be built in the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> agreed but he pointed
                            out that the Tachens control the northern entrance to the Formosa
                            Strait.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he felt we could not fool around the fringes of
                            the problem any longer. It was necessary for all concerned to speak very
                            frankly. The assumption of joint responsibility for the protection of
                            Quemoy would be a very serious step by the U.S. It might take a little
                            time to get Congress fully informed on the problem, perhaps a week or
                            so.</p>

                            Chinese Navy could again command Tachen waters which should obviate
                            necessity of direct US naval support. (<persName corresp="#p_YT1"

                                >Yu</persName> is convinced Reds will push southward with their
                            command of air and consequent ability to use otherwise inferior naval
                            power, taking Nanchi Matsu, et cetera, in due course. By that time
                            frequent alerts in Taipei would be unavoidable, due to nearness of enemy
                            air activity, and direct involvement of Formosa in conflict must be
                            expected.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Conflicting military views on importance
                            of offshore islands provide no satisfactory basis for me to express
                            opinion except from political or psychological standpoint. In latter
                            connection I believe loss of Tachen or others among more important
                            islands would have most unfortunate effect on Chinese and other Asian
                            opinion by undermining confidence in US strength and determination.
                            Subject to opinion of US military authorities, therefore I recommend
                            most sympathetic consideration of Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1"
                                >Yu</persName>’s request for statement re air support.</p>
                        <p>If on other hand it now definitely decided islands in Tachen area not
                            particularly important, I believe US should so inform Chinese and assume
                            formal responsibility for advising their evacuation before excessive
                            losses of men and material have been incurred. Such advice should be
                            considered in light of earlier US urging that “all feasible steps should
                            be taken to strengthen” island defenses.</p>
                        <p>Further consideration often overlooked in this complex situation is that
                            present Communist attacks represent clearcut case of new aggression
                            against <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> member with which US has just
                            signed defense pact. Simply calling for cease-fire, without at same time

                                China</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that he had had a full report from Secretary
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> concerning
                            the Americans being held prisoners by the communist Chinese, and that
                            the Secretary did not feel there was much solid ground for encouragement
                            in what the S. G. had said. The Secretary said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s own words were: “my
                            reason does not give me much warrant for hope, but my instinct does.”
                            The Secretary said he was not able to have the same instinct at second
                            hand that the Secretary General had at first hand. The Secretary felt,
                            however, that the <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            mission had done much to dispel genuine suspicions on the part of the
                            communists that these men were on a spying mission in China and were not
                            in a legitimate sense members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            command. Although <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> got
                            no assurances, he thinks he put medicine in the body and hopes the
                            medicine works. The Secretary said <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> did <pb n="56" xml:id="pg_56" facs="0084"
                            />bring back information about the prisoners, posed photographs, etc.,
                            which is being furnished the families.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> asked if the
                            information concerned the 11 Americans in prison only, or the four
                            pilots as well. The Secretary answered that there were no photographs of
                            the four pilots, who were in Northern Manchuria, but that information
                            and photographs had been received by some of the families of the four
                            pilots through other channels. When Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1"
                                >Knowland</persName> asked if <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> had seen the American prisoners, the
                            Secretary said he had not.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Formosa and the Off-shore
                                Islands.</hi></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the situation in the Formosa area is developing
                            in an acute way which seems to call for a sounder defensive concept than
                            now prevails, particularly on the part of the Chinese Nationalists,
                            probably involving the regrouping of their forces and strengthening
                            their positions with our help. The Secretary explained that the present
                            situation with reference to the off-shore islands is a matter of
                            historic accident, rather than one of military planning. When the
                            Nationalists were driven off the mainland, they stopped at every
                            opportunity on these islands, relinquishing them only as they were
                            compelled to. There has been a steady attrition in the Nationalist
                            position within the last five to six years, largely due to voluntary
                            withdrawals from positions which became untenable, some of them as the
                            result of minor military action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            pointed out the islands still held by the Nationalists on the map. The
                            Tachen Islands, some 300 miles north of Formosa, have some 10,000
                            Nationalist troops, in addition to guerillas, on them. One of the
                            islands, Yikiang was captured by the communists on January 18. On all
                            the off-shore islands, the Nationalists have almost 1/3 of their trained
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the present disposition of the Nationalist
                            troops is not a logical one to meet an attack. The island positions are
                            to a considerable extent untenable, or could be held only with great
                            effort not only on the part of the Nationalists but of ourselves as
                            well. A serious problem confronts us as to whether the United States is
                            justified in tying up a considerable part of its existing mobile forces
                            in that part of the world—aircraft carriers, etc.,—to try to prevent the
                            capture of these islands. The Tachen islands are so far from Formosa and
                            so relatively near communist air bases that raids can be carried out and
                            the planes return to their base before planes from Formosa could
                            intercept them. With this situation, carrier based planes would be the
                            only defense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there is no doubt in his mind that the ultimate
                            purpose of the communist Chinese is to try to take Formosa and the
                            Pescadores. The Peiping announcement of the capture of Yi-kiang <pb
                                n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0085"/>Island referred to this ultimate
                            objective, and there are other indications that their actions are
                            preparatory to taking Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the problem had reached such magnitude that it
                            had to be dealt with in a comprehensive way. The subject was discussed
                            with the President by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> and the Secretary at lunch yesterday (January
                            19) and is to be taken up with the National Security Council today. The
                            Secretary said it was their conception, broadly speaking, that there
                            should be a regrouping of Nationalist forces which would enable them to
                            effect an orderly withdrawal from some of the off-shore islands, and
                            that with some help from us they would then try to hold the remaining
                            positions, particularly the islands in the Amoy area (Quemoy and
                            adjacent islands).</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> asked how far from the mainland are
                            the islands of the Quemoy group. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> pointed it out on the map as about 5 miles. He
                            added that there are some 50,000 nationalist troops on Kinmen<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d22fn2">Chinmen, or Quemoy.</note> island in this group, and
                            that one-third of the entire nationalist army of 350,000 men are
                            scattered throughout all of the off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the problem involved elements of morale,
                            not only of the Nationalist Chinese, but of all other countries in the
                            Far East.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> asked about airfields in the area.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed on the
                            map to important communist fields on the mainland, especially the
                            principal concentration near Canton. When Senator
                                <persName>Wiley</persName> asked if the communists had big guns
                            mounted off the Quemoy group, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said not very big, that the Nationalists had
                            their guns on Kinmen and the other islands, and that this area could be
                            covered from Formosa. As to Amoy’s strategic value to the communist,
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said it was the
                            best harbor on the Chinese mainland south of Tsingtao, and that this
                            would undoubtedly be the assembling point for an invasion of Formosa,
                            100 miles away.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the big difference between Quemoy and the
                            Tachens is that the former can be covered by Nationalist air forces from
                            Formosa, while the Tachens could only be protected from carrier based
                            planes.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that this concept involved withdrawal from the
                            Tachen and some of the other islands and a regrouping of forces in more
                            important islands. This could only be carried out with the help of the
                            United States, and our assistance would be necessary to enable them to
                            get Nationalist forces, people and supplies out. The Secretary said the
                            islands under attack would be in a hopeless position <pb n="58"
                                xml:id="pg_58" facs="0086"/>and could not be reinforced; recently
                            the Nationalists were attacked while trying to resupply the island and
                            got pretty well banged up.</p>
                        <p>Rep. Arends asked if there were 10,000 troops on the island, and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that it was
                            a whole division of their trained troops, and that they have a lot of
                            supplies on the island.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>Martin</persName> asked if the Chinese Nationalists agree
                            that we should abandon the islands. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said that we have not talked with them yet, but
                            added that they could not continue to resupply the islands. The
                            Secretary said that he did talk with <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >George Yeh</persName>, the Nationalist Foreign Minister, yesterday,
                            and that they recognize that they could not possibly hold the islands
                            unless we can give them very considerable support—aircraft carriers in
                            the area, etc.—and they are talking in terms of possible evacuation.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> asked what value
                            the Tachens have, if any, from the point of view of an early warning
                            network for air raids from Formosa and Okinawa. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said there is now an old
                            Japanese radar, no good facilities. He added that if we had to, we could
                            watch the whole China area to get warnings.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> asked, if we are going to help,
                            in what way we would be called upon to help in the evacuation of the
                            Tachen islands. The Secretary answered that this would involve some risk
                            of tangling with opposing planes, and furnishing facilities for
                            evacuation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary informed the group that as another phase of the problem, we
                            are considering a parallel move involving going to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to see if it is prepared to call for a
                            cease-fire in the area and whether or not the Chinese communists will
                            comply. The Secretary said it is his opinion that the communist Chinese
                            will not comply with a cease-fire; in fact, such a proposal would
                            probably be vetoed by the Soviets in the Security Council. Nevertheless,
                            the Secretary felt that discussion in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> might be a stabilizing factor, especially if the United
                            States could quickly ratify the Formosan treaty. The Secretary said that
                            he felt that one of the factors in this flare-up of activity is the
                            feeling of the communist Chinese that they can frighten the United
                            States from going through with this treaty. Once we nail this treaty
                            down, there is some chance that the Chinese communists may tend to abate
                            their efforts if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> calls popular
                            pressure on them. The Secretary added “That is speculative, and we don’t
                            give any guarantees, but it is the best estimate we can make.”</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Congressional authorization</hi></p>
                        <p>If this program were adopted, the Secretary continued, we would want to
                            have (and the President thinks we ought to have) some authority from
                            Congress to use the armed forces of the United States in <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0087"/>the area for the protection and security
                            of Formosa and the Pescadores. Some would say that the President has
                            inherent authority in that field, but I think that is highly doubtful.
                            The President’s orders to the Seventh Fleet stemmed, presumably, from
                            the authority of the President at the time of the outbreak of the Korean
                            War. After the Korean War broke out and we became engaged pursuant to
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution, President Truman
                            issued his orders to the Seventh Fleet to, among other things, prevent
                            an attack on Formosa,<note n="3" xml:id="d22fn3">For text of President
                                Harry S. Truman’s statement of June 27, 1950, in which he announced
                                his directive to the Seventh Fleet, see <ref

                                    202</ref>.</note> and presumably the powers he exercised derived
                            from his war powers. Since the armistice in Korea, the question as to
                            whether the President has war powers deriving from the Korean War
                            becomes more and more doubtful. This would especially be true when it
                            comes to authority to send armed forces of the United States into this
                            area to assist Nationalists in regrouping their forces and to act as
                            against any concentration which seems clearly designed to presage an
                            attack on Formosa and the Pescadores themselves. Those are matters on
                            which I think the President would want to have the sanction of the
                            Congress.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>McCormack</persName> asked if the President didn’t have
                            certain powers as Commander-in-chief. He added that he was not
                            disagreeing with the Secretary, but in a matter of an emergency in which
                            the national security might be involved—</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that even if the treaty were in force, he did not
                            think the President would want to use forces of the United States under
                            the treaty without Congressional approval, either formal or informal.
                            These treaties read that an attack on the area would be a danger to the
                            United States, and the United States would act according to its
                            constitutional processes. There has always been some debate between the
                            Senate and the Executive as to just what that meant. The debate came up
                            on implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Secretary explained
                            that he had always interpreted that language to mean that if Congress
                            were in session and could be consulted the President should consult the
                            Congress to support any action which might have a belligerent character.
                            If Congress were not in session and could not be brought back in time,
                            presumably the President would be justified in acting on his own
                            responsibility. The Secretary said the President expressed that view to
                            him and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            yesterday and that the President was to meet with them further as the
                            program unfolds.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> asked if we have any troops on any of
                            the off-shore islands, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that we have some observers, the number
                            varying from two to eight.</p>
                        <pb n="60" xml:id="pg_60" facs="0088"/>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> pointed out that usually Presidential
                            intervention depends on protection of our own citizens, but that here we
                            would be intervening on the part of one of the sides to a civil war. He
                            said he firmly believed this would require congressional action, but
                            that we must not fall into the plot the Kremlin might want us to for
                            this would mean out and out war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that if we
                            do not withdraw from some of the islands and regroup the Nationalist
                            forces, there will be a falling of the islands one by one, including
                            Quemoy, involving wiping out more than a 100,000 of the best Nationalist
                            troops, a drop in morale on Formosa so that the defense of Formosa would
                            be extremely difficult and might require considerable replacements of
                            Nationalist and United States troops. We would be charged with turning
                            and running and making excuses, and the whole effect on the
                            non-communist countries in Asia would be extremely bad.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> said he thought the same
                            thing.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he felt that if this action were taken, the Formosan
                            treaty were ratified, and the President were given these powers, there
                            will be a realization that we have reached the point that we are not
                            going to retreat more and it possibly will have a stabilizing effect.
                            “In my mind, the risk of war is greater if we don’t take this action.”
                            One of the dangers leading to war comes from miscalculation. A country
                            that has gained one objective after another becomes too ambitious, goes
                            too far and war is the result. That could result here if we don’t
                            quickly map out what we are prepared to do. Up to the present time we
                            have been covering this situation by hoping the communists would be
                            deterred by uncertainty. They are probing and will continue to probe to
                            find where we will stop them. Our position has deteriorated and this
                            step must be taken.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> asked if there can be a
                            resolution presented to Congress to give the President power to use
                            troops to help Nationalist China without making it a declaration of war.
                            The Secretary said he does not suggest a declaration of war. Senator
                                <persName>Saltonstall</persName> said the resolution would be simply
                            general approval to use troops to help defend our security. The
                            Secretary said “yes”, and to use the armed forces to secure Formosa and
                            the Pescadores and whatever might be necessary to their defense. Such a
                            resolution might be effective for a year, to be renewed, if necessary,
                            and possibly with a provision for termination if as the result of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action there were a cease-fire in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Clements</persName> asked if we were ready to take a
                            position that we are drawing a line and that from that line we retreat
                            no further.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said “No”, but the position should be made clear, for he
                            felt that a continued attitude of uncertainty and of bluff from now on
                            would carry great danger.</p>
                        <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0089"/>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> asked if the Secretary thought
                            there was any connection between the prisoner of war problem and the
                            communist attacks on the islands. The Secretary said he had asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> if he thought the
                            communists reasoned that we would not engage in any defense operation
                            for fear of endangering the negotiations, and he said he did not think
                            there is a connection between the two. The Secretary added that he
                            thought it was anybody’s guess.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName>: If we intervene, and that is going to
                            be the policy of the Executive, do you think they would interfere with
                            our airforce? Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            said it was not so much a question of intervention. The first action we
                            would have to take, and there is urgency in this decision because the
                            communists are getting ready to attack the main position of the
                            Nationalists on Tachen Islands—We don’t want to lose the whole division
                            and its equipment on those islands. We would have to cover their
                            withdrawal, for they couldn’t get out without our help. Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> suggested
                            “Dunkirk”, and the Secretary said if we didn’t help, it wouldn’t be a
                            Dunkirk for they wouldn’t get out. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> continued, if we went in, first we would have to
                            put carriers in the area and keep our fighter pilots in the air while
                            the evacuation is going on, and the communists might engage them.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> asked, in case of dog-fights, how far
                            would we go? Would we pursue them inland? What if they sink a carrier?
                            We understand they have the best undersea craft in the world and have
                            more in the Far Eastern area than we have in our total fleet. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that in case of
                            a defensive action, we probably would not have to pursue communist
                            planes back to their bases; we would cover the islands and shoot them
                            down if they come over, and there would not be much danger of a
                            defensive action expanding. As far as carriers are concerned, I doubt
                            that communist planes would attack the carriers. Their submarines are a
                            long way from there, and we keep close watch of where they are. The
                            Chinese communists have only one or two in Tsingtao. The carriers are
                            protected by a submarine screen, and it is my opinion there would be no
                            Russian intervention. If they did intervene we could take care of
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName>: What would be the effect upon morale
                            if we got these troops off the islands—in Formosa and the Far East. Some
                            think the whole Far East would be against us if we meddle in this thing.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he thought
                            there was no such opinion in the Far East. I think our greatest problem
                            in the Far East is making clear to our friends what we are for and what
                            we are against. I think the most important aspect of this particular
                            problem is, whatever we decide to do, it must be published to the whole
                            world in unmistakable language.</p>

                        <p>Senator <persName>Clements</persName> asked what the Admiral meant by
                            “we”. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he
                            meant the United States, that we might expect some moral support, but as
                            far as military help from our allies is concerned, no one else has the
                            strength at this time.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>McCormack</persName> asked what the position of the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff is. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said that in September three of the Joint Chiefs
                            recommended that we hold all the off-shore islands (<persName
                                corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> dissented at that time). The
                            Admiral added that there would probably be the same division now, but
                            that he had not talked over the immediate problem with them. The
                            September decision involved a total of 10 islands.</p>
                        <p>Rep. Vinson: What number would you propose to hold now? Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said definitely all of the
                            Amoy area islands (four), and that he believed the Joint Chiefs would
                            advise holding Matsu and the Dog group.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> observed that
                            with radar on those islands there could be good coverage. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> added that they
                            would also serve as observation posts for any seaborne convoys of the
                            communists, but that we do have plane and sea patrols in the straits
                            now.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> said this decision would
                            primarily mean giving up the Tachen Islands. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that the Nationalists
                            are still on two small islands in the Tachen group. We would expect them
                            to get off the northern islands and we would cover their withdrawal.
                            There are some 10,000 civilians on those islands which we would have to
                            offer to evacuate.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> commented that he
                            agreed that if we plan to get out of some of the islands we must tell
                            the world how far we are going and that we are going no further. On his
                            trip this year, he had found that most of the people don’t know what we
                            are doing and would like to know. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said it was his view as the result of his recent
                            trip that Far Eastern countries don’t know what we plan to do. The only
                            way we can stabilize the situation and probably prevent a live war is by
                            a firm stand now.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>McCormack</persName>: “We are committed to the defense of
                            Formosa and the Pescadores.” Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said that is a protective motive. Communist
                            control of this area would outflank the Philippines and cut across all
                            our defenses. The Secretary said that it would so jeopardize our
                            offshore defenses that it would really be a matter of time before we
                            would be forced back to Hawaii or the West Coast. He added that the
                            sentiment in the Philippines is extremely sensitive to the Formosan
                            situation. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            pointed out that the psychological effect of the loss of Formosa, in
                            Japan and other countries in the Far East would be terrific.</p>
                        <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0091"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that this
                            position would implement the pending treaty which covers only Formosa
                            and the Pescadores. He said he was not suggesting a permanent position
                            any different from the treaty, but the treaty also says we will react to
                            an attack against Formosa and the Pescadores. Considering the present
                            mood of the Chinese communists, the proposed position seemed the only
                            one to take. If the situation changes so that there is acceptance by the
                            Chinese communists of the treaty position that we have taken concerning
                            Formosa, or if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease-fire pacifies
                            the area, then the commitment insofar as the off-shore islands is
                            concerned would disappear. I would not recommend our assuming any
                            permanent obligation to defending anything other than Formosa and the
                            Pescadores. The other islands come in only because the Chinese
                            communists profess that they are attacking Formosa and the Pescadores.
                            The Nationalists have large numbers of their best troops on Kinman
                            (Chinmen). As long as the Chinese communists profess their goal to drive
                            them out, then I think it would be criminal folly on our part to sit and
                            watch the taking of the approaches to these islands which could be held
                            with minor help on our part. We would be weakening our ultimate position
                            that we are obligated to defend Formosa and the Pescadores
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName>: Even assuming
                            for the moment that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease-fire
                            should be tentatively or otherwise accepted by the Chinese communists,
                            do you have any reason to believe they would respect a cease-fire any
                            more than they have complied in other instances such as Indochina, where
                            they were building up their fire-power six times what it had been—or is
                            there any reason to believe they would use a cease-fire to gather
                            equipment in this instance and improve their position?</p>
                        <p>Representative <persName>McCormack</persName>: If we get the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> into it won’t we compromise ourselves
                            further. It seems to me that if we take affirmative action, it should be
                            without qualification, without any if’s to it. I pointed out in a speech
                            in Boston the other day that confining ourselves to the Pescadores and
                            Formosa was an invitation to the communists to take the other islands.
                            If we take this action, we better be firm without qualification.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Clements</persName> referred to the September decision
                            of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to retain 10 islands,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d22fn4">The reference is unclear. In September 1954 the
                                Joint Chiefs of Staff held divided views concerning U.S. policy with
                                respect to the Nationalist-held offshore islands. See the memorandum

                            and asked if there is any unanimity among them now. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said this situation arose <pb
                                n="64" xml:id="pg_64" facs="0092"/>at lunch with the President
                            yesterday and he had not had a chance to discuss it with the Chiefs.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Clements</persName> asked if such a resolution came to
                            Congress whether the President would state the United States’ position.
                            The Secretary said it would be on the basis of the President’s message,
                            whether he delivered it in person or not. Senator
                                <persName>Clements</persName> asked if our position would be clearly
                            drawn, what we are willing to defend, where we will draw the line, and
                            where we will retreat no further. The Secretary said it was his view
                            that this should be made clear, leaving some latitude for details for
                            the military exigencies of the situation, but this should be made clear
                            in the President’s message or in subsequent action of the Executive. He
                            agreed that the time has come when we need to make our position clear
                            and that we will stick to it. Senator <persName>Clements</persName>
                            reiterated that not only must our position be made clear, but there must
                            be assurances given that we will make it stick.</p>
                        <p>Representative Vinson: You stated the off-shore islands would not be kept
                            permanently. I assume that was on the ground they have no particular
                            value to the defense of Formosa. The Secretary explained that Formosa
                            and the Pescadores form a natural part of the off-shore island chain; he
                            did not think the United States should be permanently committed to
                            holding these small islands as part of the treaty obligation.</p>
                        <p>Representative Vinson asked, if the Reds took these islands, would this
                            jeopardize the proper defense of Formosa. The Secretary believed that if
                            they fell into the hands of the communists in the present circumstances,
                            he felt it would jeopardize the defense of Formosa from the
                            psychological factor. The value of the islands at the present time is
                            partly military and partly psychological, and those factors do change.
                            Some of the islands are virtually unhabitable except at terrific cost.
                            To extricate ourselves from some of them, we would have to firm up our
                            position somewhere else.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> commented that
                            amphibious operations against small islands involve considerable vessels
                            and air coverage from communist China, but to take Formosa and the
                            Pescadores a much larger operation would be involved, with 9 million
                            people on Formosa. The communists would have to count on a sizable
                            invasion fleet in some harbor area. He asked whether the harbor of Amoy
                            is a likely spot where an invasion force would be gathered for an
                            invasion of Formosa if Quemoy and the other islands were not held.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said it would be
                            a logical base for assembling large convoys.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> referred to
                            Representative Vinson’s question concerning intangible factors which the
                            Secretary had mentioned. He added that if we decided we would not
                            support any of the off-shore <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0093"
                            />islands and told the Nationalists they must withdraw and we would
                            cover, they might not agree with us. We are not even sure they will
                            agree with this much. We must look at our own interests—holding Formosa
                            means having friendly, non-communist forces on that island. They might
                            say this is hopeless and Formosa would fall from internal collapse. If
                            the troops on Formosa became convinced this is hopeless, we might have
                            to go in ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> asked what
                            attitude or reaction there had been from the Chinese Nationalists on the

                                >in</hi>?] the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> had asked that
                            alternatives be explored and that he has been working actively on the
                            subject and had worked out a plan that has been pretty well covered with
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia and New Zealand. When
                            Assistant Secretary [<persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>]
                            was in Formosa in October,<note n="5" xml:id="d22fn5">For text of
                                    <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName>’s memorandum
                                of <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s conversations
                                with <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> during
                                his visit to Taipei, October 12–14, 1954, see <ref

                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> who had indicated they
                            would go along, reluctantly, if as a counterpart the United States
                            entered into the treaty with Formosa and made some arrangement for
                            assisting them on some of the off-shore islands. Since the treaty has
                            been signed, however, they have not been as favorable as they were
                            previously.</p>
                        <p>Rep. Vinson asked if it had been determined that a joint resolution will
                            be requested from Congress to authorize the President to supply forces.
                            The Secretary answered that there has not been a final decision by the
                            President, but that he is thinking along those lines and had asked the
                            Secretary to explore it with the leadership today. Later, the Secretary
                            said, he would join the President and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> at the National Security
                            Council meeting today, and it is likely that a firm decision will be
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>McCormack</persName> asked how quick action must be.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that
                            communist attacks on the Tachens would depend on the weather. If the
                            decision is made that we will cover the Nationalist withdrawal from the
                            Tachens we would move three carriers to Okinawa to be in readiness. If
                            there is good weather in the Tachens, it is just a question of what day
                            the communists will pick.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> asked what the possibilities would be
                            if the Nationalists didn’t agree to the proposal. The Secretary replied
                            that we would be in a hell of a fix. Before any steps are taken by this
                            Government, however, we would try to get their agreement. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he thought the
                            Nationalists would agree to this proposal.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> said the newspapers had reported that
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>, the
                            Nationalist Foreign Minister, had left the Department the day before in
                            a huff. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said he had left the Secretary’s office with
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName> the day before
                            and that he was not in a huff and was in as good a humour as he could
                            be. The Secretary said that when he mentioned such a plan <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> had said he would report to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>, and we are now
                            awaiting his views.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> commented that a
                            quick ratification of the Formosa treaty would be necessary. The
                            Secretary agreed, pointing out that he thought one of the factors back
                            of the communist activity at this time was in the hope that they would
                            scare us out of ratifying the treaty. With ratification an accepted
                            fact, it might take some of the heat out of the situation. If they think
                            they can frighten us out of the treaty, they will continue their
                            activity, and the Secretary considered it very desirable that we act on
                            the treaty as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Saltonstall</persName> referred to the possibility of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action, and as one who wants to
                            believe in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, after the unsuccessful
                            efforts on the prisoners of war, he asked if it would not weaken the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to give it another job doubtful of
                            success. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said
                            that there are pressures from many quarters to get this matter into the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He believed the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> will be a good place to mobilize world
                            opinion as to what we are thinking and that it would be better to do
                            that. He said he did not believe anything would be accomplished other
                            than that. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>’s principal function is
                            as an opinion forming body. Undoubtedly a veto would [be] made if the
                            matter came before the Security Council, but we would be able to get
                            world opinion to support us which is important. We also have a critical
                            situation in Europe, and it is extremely important that we make an
                            effort to get <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> support rather than
                            giving the impression that we are acting on our own in a reckless way
                            and trying to get into war with the communists. On the whole, the
                            Secretary thought we would gain more than we would lose in trying to get
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to act and that to oppose such a
                            procedure would be a mistake.</p>
                        <p>Rep. Chiperfield asked if the Secretary feels that the treaty should be
                            ratified before Congress is asked to take other action. The Secretary
                            said that although time would be important in both cases, he did not
                            think it is vitally important which comes first. As he had pointed out,
                            he felt the treaty is extremely important. Even if it were in force,
                            however, he felt the question of implementation would arise, and he felt
                            the President would not want to rely merely on the treaty powers but
                            would want to bring the matter to the Congress. So the treaty would not
                            replace the need for Congressional action, although, if consummated, it
                            might destroy one of the objectives the <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67"
                                facs="0095"/>communists have in their present operation. The two
                            things could go ahead concurrently.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>McCormack</persName> commented that we have had
                            commitments in this area since June 20 [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>],
                            1950. The Secretary agreed, although he said the question of the
                            President’s authority is obscure following the Korean armistice.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_PJB1">Byrd</persName> asked if this
                            proposal would get the support of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            having in mind their efforts to get Chinese communists admitted to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary said he thought
                            they would be sympathetic to the position. He said he thought the
                            British were beginning to be frightened as to the Chinese communist
                            menace and are beginning to feel that it endangers Malaya. He said he
                            believed they would be sympathetic to this course of action. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> agreed that the
                            British are more concerned than they were.</p>
                        <p>Rep. Arends asked if it were a matter of days or weeks. The Secretary
                            replied that it is a matter of days.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>Martin</persName>: If the President can do this without
                            action on the part of Congress—today’s session in the House will be our
                            last one until next Monday.<note n="6" xml:id="d22fn6">January
                                24.</note> The Secretary said the President would probably not be
                            able to send up a message until Monday. Rep. <persName>Martin</persName>
                            said that if the plan is to go to Congress and time is important, if the
                            support of the leadership on the policy were obtained, would the
                            President go ahead, in the interest of secrecy. He said his thought was
                            that once the President presents the plan to Congress, the communists
                            would attack right away. The Secretary said he thought it would be
                            better to have a clear indication of national unity with Congress behind
                            it. Rep. <persName>Martin</persName> said his use of the word “secret”
                            was probably unfortunate, but that he had in mind the national
                            interest.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said if the
                            situation got critical we might just fly some patrols over and make a
                            demonstration.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> said it is vital to
                            decide whether we are going to bring up the treaty or the other thing
                            first. The treaty discussion in the Senate will blow the whole thing
                            wide open and may damage the other, so this question should be decided
                            quickly. Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> said
                            there could be prolonged debate in the Senate under its rules on the
                            treaty, and since it would be a matter of days within which the
                            communists could destroy the division on Tachen, he would think the
                            resolution should be offered first rather than the treaty.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Clements</persName> said that if it is a question of
                            speed, a resolution is not the way to get it; there will be discussion
                            in the Senate on the resolution. If the President can make it positive,
                            that would help.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> commented that
                            if the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>,
                            and the President recommend this in the national interest, <pb n="68"
                                xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>that would give it a strong position.
                            Senator <persName>Clements</persName> said this information would have
                            been valuable to have had before this meeting was called, and they would
                            have been in a much better position to handle the problem.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> defense pact hearings have
                            been completed, and as soon as the list of witnesses on the Formosa
                            treaty has been made up his Committee would be ready to act on the
                            treaty. He said those were the preliminary steps and his committee would
                            go ahead.</p>
                        <p>Rep. <persName>McCormack</persName> commented that if the Congress
                            adopted the resolution that would be as good as approval of the treaty.
                            He said he wanted action and thought we have been duly dallying too
                            long.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary, referring to Senator <persName>Clements</persName>’
                            reference to the time of the meeting, said we might be criticized for
                            not consulting before the executive branch had come to a decision.
                            Senator <persName>Clements</persName> said his comment was not intended
                            as criticism but only as an observation.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> asked what is
                            going to be said to the press about this meeting, since they were
                            hovering around outside like bees. The Secretary suggested that they
                            simply say that it was a briefing on the status of the American
                            prisoners of war and recent military activity off the China coast—to by
                            all means avoid anything that might involve a war scare.</p>
                        <p>Rep. McCormick said that assuming that the President decides a request
                            for a resolution should be sent up, he thought the Secretary and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> should have an
                            expression of views of the legislative branch (he doesn’t like word
                            “leaders”), and that this would be of assistance when the decision is
                            made.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> said he thought
                            the President should come to the Congress in person to present this
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName>Wiley</persName> said he was no specialist in this

                            the islands. He said that Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1"

                        <p>Since Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> were now present,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that the
                            Director of Central Intelligence brief the Council on recent
                            developments in the Tachen Islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> began with a prediction
                            that the loss of Ichiang Island in the Tachens group to the Chinese
                            Communists would shortly be followed by Chinese Communist attacks on the
                            main group of the Tachen Islands.</p>
                        <p>In the action against Ichiang, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said that the Communist forces had consisted of
                            one regiment and two battalions of Chinese Communist troops, numbering
                            between 3000 and 4000. Against this force the Nationalist garrison on
                            Ichiang had consisted of just under 1000 guerrillas. The island had been
                            captured after about two hours of fighting. The Communists had handled
                            the action with considerable skill. They had had very careful cover so
                            that there had been little warning, either of the landing forces or of
                            the Communist <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>air sorties, which
                            had numbered 60. All U.S. personnel on the Tachens, numbering eight, had
                            been evacuated except one individual.</p>
                        <p>With the capture of the island, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> pointed out, the Chinese Communists were in a
                            good position to shell the main Tachen Islands, which were only seven
                            and a half miles distant from Ichiang. The Nationalists were obviously
                            preparing to risk further losses of naval vessels in order to support
                            the garrison on the main Tachen Islands. This move was necessary,
                            however, if the morale of the garrison, which was not very good in any
                            case, was to be kept up.</p>
                        <p>According to other reports, the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> was now considering the desirability of
                            evacuating the Chinese Nationalist forces from the remainder of the
                            Tachen Islands. Unfortunately, there was some question as to whether he
                            would be able to withdraw these garrisons even if he desired to, except
                            in the unlikely event that the Chinese Communists voluntarily permitted
                            these forces to be evacuated. In any event, the loss of the Tachen
                            Islands would have a very unfortunate effect on the morale of the
                            Chinese Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that the
                            Nationalists had retaliated yesterday for the attack on Ichiang, by a
                            series of air strikes on Communist ports and shipping, especially in
                            Swatow, where they had apparently sunk a British flag vessel of some
                            1700 tons. From Quemoy the Nationalists had yesterday bombarded two
                            adjacent islands held by the Chinese Communists. There had been no
                            substantial Chinese Communist attacks on Quemoy during the last few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called on the
                            Secretary of State to speak.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was
                            sorry indeed to have to inaugurate the second year of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Administration with a
                            recital of serious problems. However, he had come to the conclusion,
                            over the last few days and hours, that the situation in the Tachens and
                            on the other islands held by the Chinese Nationalists had deteriorated
                            so rapidly that it was very unlikely that any of these islands could be
                            defended against Chinese Communist attack in the absence of U.S. armed
                            support on a very considerable scale. Since the United States had not
                            proposed to offer the Chinese Nationalists any assistance in the defense
                            of these islands which would involve the armed forces of the United
                            States, the time had come for a reconsideration of our policy of
                            refusing to participate in the military defense of <hi rend="italic"
                                >any</hi> of the Nationalist-held offshore islands. The loss of the
                            Tachen group of islands would have very serious psychological effects
                            not only on the Chinese Nationalists, but in other areas of the Far East
                            such as Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, unless this loss were
                            accompanied by a clearer indication than was now available of United
                            States intentions and where we stood ourselves. If it were indicated <pb
                                n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"/>that the Communists were free to
                            seize all these offshore islands, the result would be very bad
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, it had seemed to him wise to suggest that the
                            evacuation of the Tachen island group should be offset by a stated
                            willingness on the part of the United States to assist with its armed
                            forces in holding the Quemoy Islands and possibly the Matsu group. These
                            two groups of islands covered the harbor entrance of Amoy and Foochow,
                            respectively, whence a Chinese Communist invasion of Formosa would
                            probably be mounted. Moreover, the Chinese Communists invariably related
                            their attacks on these offshore islands to their determination
                            ultimately to “liberate” Formosa.</p>
                        <p>So, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the
                            United States is faced with what is in fact a series of Communist
                            military operations which are ultimately directed toward the capture of
                            Formosa. He therefore concluded that it would have a very grave effect
                            throughout all the nations of free Asia if we were to clarify a U.S.
                            position which in effect amounted to abandonment of all the
                            Nationalist-held offshore islands. People would of course pose the
                            question of why it is necessary for the United States to clarify its
                            position on these islands. We had decided not to do so up to the present
                            in the hope of confusing the Chinese Communists as to our real
                            intentions vis-à-vis these islands. This policy of obscuring our
                            intentions had, however, begun to backfire, and the Chinese Communists
                            were apparently confident in the belief that the United States was
                            unwilling to fight in order to save any of these islands. Accordingly,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> could see no
                            further advantage in the policy of obscuring our intentions, and
                            insisted that further pursuit of it would embarrass U.S. prestige in the
                            Far East.</p>
                        <p>This being so, the next question was what to do. It seemed to him, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, fundamentally
                            unsound for the United States to try to assist the Chinese Nationalists
                            to hold the northern groups of islands. The Tachens and the other
                            islands in this area were simply too difficult to defend. On the other
                            hand, Quemoy and the Matsu group could be readily protected by U.S. air
                            power, including such air power based on Formosa. Accordingly, the
                            Administration might well consider a new policy which would involve (1)
                            the use of U.S. armed forces to assist the Chinese Nationalists to
                            evacuate their garrisons from the northernmost islands, and (2) support
                            of the Chinese Nationalists in the defense of Quemoy and perhaps the
                            Matsu Islands, <hi rend="italic">so long as</hi> the Chinese Communists
                            professed to be preparing to attack Formosa.</p>
                        <p>If we could make this proposal clear and at the same time push through
                            quickly the mutual defense treaty with Formosa, and if we are truly
                            determined to hold Formosa and related areas needed in <pb n="72"
                                xml:id="pg_72" facs="0100"/>order to hold Formosa, all this would be
                            the best possible way to avoid a steady deterioration of the U.S.
                            position in the general area, and specifically would provide the best
                            means of defending Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>At the same time, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, the United States should encourage, or at least
                            acquiesce in, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> actions designed to
                            bring about a cease-fire in this general area. Secretary <persName

                            action to stabilize the situation in the area. He had followed out this
                            directive, and as a result we had on hand a program for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action which had been carefully worked
                            out with the British and New Zealand. This program had now been on the
                            shelf, however, for some months. While he could not, therefore,
                            guarantee that the British were still in favor of such a procedure, he
                            had made inquiries of London, and expected word of the British attitude
                            today. Meanwhile, his guess was that the British would continue to
                            support this program for action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                            >UN</gloss>. While he doubted very much whether the Chinese Communists
                            would accept any <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action unfavorable to
                            themselves, such a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action might
                            nevertheless have at least some deterrent effect on the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then informed the
                            Council that he and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> had just met with various leaders of Congress to
                            discuss the subject of our policy toward the offshore islands. These
                            Congressional leaders had included the Majority and Minority heads of
                            the two Foreign Relations Committees and the two Armed Services
                            Committees, as well as Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1"
                                >Knowland</persName>, the Minority Leader of the Senate, and Mr.
                                <persName>Clements</persName>, who had taken the place of Senator
                                <persName>Lyndon Johnson</persName>.<note n="3" xml:id="d23fn3"
                                >Senator <persName>Lyndon B. Johnson</persName> of Texas, Senate
                                Majority Leader.</note> Also present were the Majority and Minority
                            Leaders of the House.</p>
                        <p>In the course of describing the existing situation to these members of
                            Congress, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said,
                            there had been considerable discussion of the President’s authority to
                            commit U.S. armed forces to the task of evacuating the northern group of
                            islands and of assisting in the defense of Quemoy. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> himself described the
                            President’s authority to do this as “now rather vague”. This power had
                            stemmed from the existence of hostilities in Korea, but since the
                            armistice in Korea the President’s war powers had been “subject to
                            considerable attrition”. Inasmuch as we might very well have to use our
                            armed forces in order to evacuate the garrison on the Tachens, and since
                            this might well involve actual conflict between the American <pb n="73"
                                xml:id="pg_73" facs="0101"/>forces and the Chinese Communists,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had indicated
                            his opinion that it would be best to meet this situation by a clear
                            enunciation of, and a grant to the President by the Congress of, the
                            power to commit the armed forces of the United States to the defense of
                            Formosa and related areas.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            pointed out to these Congressional leaders that the United States
                            certainly did not plan any permanent commitment of the armed forces of
                            the United States to hold these offshore islands, nor was there any
                            intent whatsoever to enlarge the area of the mutual defense treaty. This
                            area, however, not only covered Formosa and the Pescadores, but also
                            covered “attacks directed against Formosa and the Pescadores”. The
                            latter, it could be argued, could cover U.S. action in Quemoy and the
                            Matsus. Furthermore, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had argued that even if the proposed mutual
                            defense treaty were at present actually in force, the President would
                            desire, if time permitted, a Congressional grant of authority for the
                            use of the armed forces of the United States in the circumstances
                            described. If Congress were not in session, or time did not permit,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that
                            the President could act. A lack of adequate authority at the present
                            time could be very dangerous indeed in view of possible contingencies in
                            the near future.</p>
                        <p>In sum, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the
                            discussion with the members of Congress had been extended—from 9:00 a.m.
                            until nearly 11:00. In the course of the discussion the problem had been
                            pretty fully explored, and the Congressional leaders had asked many
                            questions, especially of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>. He and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> had drawn the conclusion that the members of
                            Congress had generally recognized the dangers inherent in the situation
                            and the great importance of an unequivocal statement of the U.S.
                            position—unequivocal both as it applied to the Executive and the
                            Legislative Branches of the Government. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also believed that there was
                            little doubt that the Congress would promptly give the President the
                            powers which he needed to meet the situation, although it might be
                            necessary for the President to appear personally before a joint session
                            of the two houses. Likewise, continued Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, the members of Congress with
                            whom he had talked seemed in general to approve the course of action
                            which he had outlined above, except in the case of Senator
                                <persName>Wiley</persName>, and even Senator
                                <persName>Wiley</persName>, thought Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, was unlikely to persist in his
                            opposition. A minority of the Congressional group, thought Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, apparently favored an
                            effort by the United States to hold all the offshore islands. The
                            majority, however, thought that his balance was sound.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ statement, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> inquired if Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> wished to add anything. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0102"/>said that he believed that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ statement had
                            been so detailed and so accurate that he himself had nothing to add to
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired which of the Congressional leaders had expressed
                            the view that the United States should assist in the defense of <hi
                                rend="italic">all</hi> the Nationalist-held offshore islands.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that, in so
                            far as they had been able to understand him, this had been the view of
                            Senator <persName>Wiley</persName>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> added that the House Majority Leader, Mr.
                                <persName>McCormack</persName>, had expressed strongly the view that
                            the President now had, without further Congressional action, all the
                            powers he needed to hold the offshore islands in the face of Communist
                            attacks.</p>
                        <p>The President said that a decision by the United States to give up the
                            Tachen Islands, which the Joint Chiefs of Staff were already on record
                            as having said were not vital to the defense of Formosa, would at least
                            have the merit of showing the world that the United States was trying to
                            maintain a decent posture. At the same time, the proposed policy would
                            make clear that this U.S. concession with respect to the Tachens would
                            not mean that the United States was prepared to make any concessions
                            with respect to Formosa and the Pescadores. The particular problem,
                            continued the President, with respect to the defense of the Tachens was
                            the lack of a safe port for our ships in this area. As a result, it
                            would be very difficult for us to sustain the garrisons in the Tachen
                            Islands. All in all, concluded the President, an announcement of a
                            decision to evacuate the Tachens garrison, together with a statement of
                            our determination to hold Formosa and the islands “in front of it”
                            (Quemoy and the Matsus), would appear to be the best course of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then explained
                            that he had had a discussion on this subject yesterday with <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>, the Foreign Minister of
                            the Chinese Republic. He expected to receive a reply some time today,
                            and while he anticipated that the Chinese Nationalists would profess to
                            be greatly saddened at not being able to hold all the offshore islands,
                            they would be quite willing to accept something less than all. The
                            President commented that he thought that they would be glad to do so
                            because the new arrangement would tie in Nationalist China very actively
                            with the United States.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then observed that he
                            wished to call the Council’s attention to the exact language of the
                            present policy of the United States with respect to the offshore
                            islands, and thereafter to ask the Secretary of State a question. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then proceeded to read
                            paragraph 5–c of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5429/5, as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    to the Chinese Nationalist forces military equipment and
                                    training to assist them to defend such offshore islands, using

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then put his question to
                            the Secretary of State: Would not an American commitment to employ its
                            armed forces in the defense of Quemoy and the Matsu Islands almost
                            certainly involve the United States in military actions on the mainland
                            of Communist China? Would not there be inevitable hot pursuit far
                            inland? Accordingly, it seemed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> that if the United States were to adopt the

                                >Dulles</persName>, we should be very clear indeed that by so doing
                            we are greatly enhancing the risk of war with Communist China. Had the
                            Secretary of State gone into these long-range consequences in his
                            discussions with the members of Congress?</p>
                        <p>The President said that he disagreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s fundamental premise. The proposed course of
                            action would not merely not enhance, it would actually decrease the risk
                            of war with Communist China which we are now running under our existing
                            policy. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> also
                            argued that there was greater risk of war in leaving our position
                            unclear with respect to the offshore islands than in making it clear, as
                            he proposed to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> repeated his insistence
                            that if the Chinese Communists attacked Quemoy and the Matsus, and the
                            United States assisted the Chinese Nationalists to resist the
                            Communists, our aircraft would certainly go in hot pursuit of enemy
                            aircraft, and the danger of one incident leading ultimately to another
                            and ultimately to war with China seemed very clear to him. The President
                            commented that of course if the Chinese Communists wanted to make
                            general war out of anything the United States did, there was nothing we
                            could do to prevent it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said it was
                            very hard for him to understand, and even harder for him to justify, the
                            proposal to retain the Quemoys, which were set right down in the middle
                            of a Chinese <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0104"/>Communist harbor.
                            Quemoy was a “hot spot” right in the middle of Chinese Communist
                            territory.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            the answer to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>’s misgivings was as follows: As long as the Chinese
                            Communists insist that they are going to take Quemoy as part of their
                            operations for the ultimate seizure of Formosa, all this put Quemoy in a
                            very different light. If we wait to mount our defense of Formosa until
                            we have lost all these islands, and much of our prestige as well, we
                            would be fighting at a terrible disadvantage. That seemed to be the
                            choice which now confronted us.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> interrupted this
                            exchange by pointing out that the most probable Chinese Communist
                            action, if the United States determines to hold Quemoy, would be to
                            resort to constant artillery pounding of the Quemoy defenses until these
                            defenses had been pulverized. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>, however, said that such pulverization of
                            Quemoy’s defenses by the Communists would not be possible in the face of
                            Chinese Nationalist air attacks on the surrounding Chinese Communist
                            areas.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that unless we were prepared “completely to
                            discount Formosa”, further delay in making up our minds would result in
                            rapid and serious deterioration of the situation. He still insisted that
                            the chances of general war with Communist China would be less under the
                            course of action now proposed by the Secretary of State than the
                            “dangerous drift” which we are now in.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that yes,
                            this might be the case until and as long as the United States refuses to
                            draw a clear and sensible defense line and abandons any attempt to
                            defend territories lying outside this defense line. The real question,
                            however, was where to draw this defense line, and why Quemoy should be
                            included within it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that prior
                            to the time at Denver when Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had proposed his plan for <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action to stabilize the situation on the offshore
                            islands, he himself had had a proposal which had appealed to him but
                            which he had abandoned in deference to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> proposal. His own idea had been that the only reasonable
                            hope of stabilizing the situation in the Far East was a determination by
                            the United States to hold Formosa and the Pescadores. There could be no
                            “cooling off of the hot situation” vis-à-vis Communist China so long as
                            these other close-in islands remained in the hands of the Chinese
                            Nationalists. To let them remain in Nationalist hands was simply to
                            invite Chinese Communist military action against them. Accordingly, if
                            we make a new move now, we should get the Chinese Nationalist garrisons
                            off just as many of these small islands as we can, and should explain
                            that the sole reason <pb n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0105"/>that we are
                            assisting in holding any of the islands at all is that they are vital to
                            the defense of Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> added that he
                            thought it was foolish to fight a terrible war with Communist China
                            simply in order to hold all these little islands. It was plain that
                            there was no hope in the world that the Chinese Nationalists could
                            overcome and supplant the Communist regime on mainland China. He
                            therefore repeated that our only reasonable hope of stabilizing the
                            whole U.S. position in the Pacific was to evince our determination to
                            hold the great offshore island chain and let the rest go. In short, we
                            should defend only Formosa and the Pescadores and let the others go. The
                            alternative seemed to him to be general war with Communist China. As
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> was expressing
                            his agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, the latter added that once we had got off the
                            smaller offshore islands we should make it clear to the Chinese
                            Communists that if they attacked Formosa it would mean war with the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed
                            agreement with the policy advocated by the Secretary of State, not only
                            for the reasons which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had given, but for other reasons as well. As the
                            Chinese Communists continued to build up their power and prestige and
                            took more and more of these islands, they inevitably set in motion a
                            deterioration of the position. He greatly feared the psychological
                            effect on the free nations of Asia of the gradual loss of all these
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>The President intervened to say that it seemed clear to him that Quemoy
                            and the Matsus were the outposts for the defense of Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that he
                            by no means disagreed with the position taken by Secretaries <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> “over the long period”. However,
                            these things are largely a matter of timing. We must now deal with a
                            practical situation which is on our hands, and this was certainly not
                            the moment or the occasion to inform the Chinese Nationalists that we
                            would not assist them to hold any of the offshore islands. To do so
                            would at present have a catastrophic effect on Chinese Nationalist
                            morale. However, if later on the situation cooled down and the Chinese
                            Communists renounced their intention of seizing Formosa, the United
                            States would then be in a position to give up these other islands, as
                            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> were recommending.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had indicated that we would only assist in
                            holding these offshore islands until the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> acted to stabilize the situation or the intentions of
                            Communist China toward Formosa had changed. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed with the President that
                            this was an accurate description of his position.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that on the
                            contrary, he could not but feel that the Chinese Communists were very
                            logical in their determination <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0106"/>to
                            seize the offshore islands. The Chinese Communists simply felt that they
                            were putting the finishing touches on a victorious civil war. The
                            President inquired how Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> knew that in this event the Chinese Communists
                            would stop short of Formosa. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> replied that he did not know this. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that the whole
                            policy of the Chinese Communists with regard to the offshore islands was
                            ultimately directed against Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President at this point inquired as to the mechanics of making
                            clear our new intentions regarding the offshore islands. Who would
                            announce the decision of the United States to assist in the evacuation
                            of the northern group of islands and the holding of others?</p>
                        <p>In answer to the Vice President, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> suggested that the President would make such an
                            announcement in the form of a message to the Congress, which would state
                            in effect that it had become necessary for the Chinese Communists to
                            regroup and consolidate their forces on these offshore islands. The
                            precise details would not be spelled out, but the President’s statement
                            would convey the idea that some of these islands would be evacuated and
                            that others would be held because they were related to our determination
                            to defend Formosa. The Presidential statement would likewise make
                            reference to action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and to the
                            desirability of a ceasefire.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President explained that the reason he had asked his question
                            was that if the announcement were made in person to the Congress by the
                            President, certain political difficulties could surely be anticipated.
                            The President added that he was personally opposed to appearing before
                            the Congress, and thought that this part of the plan should be played
                            down.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> said that while of
                            course we did not wish to become involved in a war with Communist China
                            over Quemoy, neither did we wish to get involved in such a war over
                            Formosa. We therefore must be sure that in trying to avoid the first we
                            do not bring on the second. With respect to the point made by the Vice
                            President on the form of the President’s statement, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> also expressed the hope that
                            the President would not feel it necessary to deliver his message to the
                            Congress in person. The impact of such a personal appearance would be so
                            strong as almost certainly to set in motion trends toward inflation and
                            a hue and cry for the imposition of controls on the economy.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that so
                            far as he could discern, the members of the National Security Council
                            were all in favor of the same general policy respecting this problem,
                            except that they did not agree on “where the line should be drawn”. The
                            President added—“and when the line should be drawn.” Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> went on <pb n="79"
                                xml:id="pg_79" facs="0107"/>to say that if the purpose of the
                            Secretary of State’s policy was simply to defend Quemoy until the
                            Chinese Nationalist garrison could be evacuated, he was glad to accept
                            such a proposal. He was, however, firmly opposed to any U.S. commitment
                            which contemplated holding Quemoy indefinitely. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added that of course the United
                            States could not forcibly remove the Chinese Nationalist garrison from
                            Quemoy without starting a war with Nationalist China. Governor <persName
                                corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that it was not only
                            Formosa and Quemoy which we were talking about, but a lot of other
                            countries in the Far East. The United States must take a strong position
                            which will have a bracing effect on the free countries of the Far East.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> countered with
                            the statement that nothing in the world would please Soviet Russia so
                            much as to get the United States involved in hostilities with Communist
                            China. The President said that he could not agree more.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that it seemed
                            to him that most of the members of the National Security Council were
                            determined to look only on the rosy alternative as to what was likely to
                            happen if this new proposed course of action were adopted. The Council
                            was refusing to face up to the darker alternative—namely, that war with
                            China was a very real risk if the United States were to commit itself
                            militarily to the defense of Quemoy.</p>
                        <p>The President again brought the discussion back to the problem of
                            Congress and of Presidential authority to take action on the offshore
                            islands in order to defend Formosa. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> inquired whether the President
                            felt that he had now sufficient authority to order the commitment of
                            U.S. forces to assist in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. The
                            President replied that in any case it was necessary to draw the line.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            after all, the United States had warmly encouraged the Chinese
                            Nationalists to continue to hold all the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>The President then raised the question as to the whereabouts of the units
                            of the Seventh Fleet, and whether it would not be desirable to move some
                            of the aircraft carriers in the general direction of Formosa. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that it might be desirable to move some of our carriers toward
                            the area of the Tachens at once.</p>
                        <p>The President explained his opinion that it was not that any of these
                            offshore islands was going to be easy to defend, but that the
                            psychological consequences of abandoning these islands were so serious.
                            It had long been the general policy of this Administration to help build
                            up indigenous forces to defend on the ground against Chinese Communist
                            attacks. It would be the role of the United States merely to supply air
                            and naval support in the event of overt Communist aggression. We were
                            now confronting a concrete test of this <pb n="80" xml:id="pg_80"
                                facs="0108"/>policy, and we must be concerned with the morale of
                            those soldiers who might well be called upon to defend Formosa if the
                            Chinese Communists attacked it.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that on
                            the contrary, it looked to him as though in this new policy toward the
                            offshore islands, the United States was actually trying to seize Chinese
                            Communist territories. Expressing agreement with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> repeated that he was more than
                            willing to defend Formosa, but certainly not these “darn’ little
                            islands”. The President said that this was all very well, but we
                            probably couldn’t hold Formosa if <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> gives up in despair before Formosa is attacked.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            while that was the bad feature on one side of the argument, the bad
                            feature on the other was the prospect of war with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> insisted that
                            what the President was pointing out is sure to happen if we abandon all
                            these islands. The resultant effect on morale on Formosa would be
                            terrible. Moreover, as for the chances of this policy involving the
                            United States in war with Communist China, he thought there was less
                            than a 50-50 chance, because the Chinese Communists didn’t want to “get
                            tough with us in a big way” at this time. What they wanted to do was to
                            erode our position in the area.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> added that
                            nevertheless he wished the United States could trade Quemoy for the
                            captured American flyers.</p>
                        <p>The Council then briefly discussed the reliability and the fighting
                            spirit of the Chinese Nationalist garrison on the Tachen Islands. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> described it as
                            “rather poor” as a result of the January 10 attack. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, on the other hand, thought
                            that morale seemed very good when he had discussed it on his recent
                            trip, and he believed that the defense position on the Tachen Islands
                            was so strong that it would cost the Communists a lot to take it.
                            Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> pointed out that
                            once the Chinese Communists begin their attacks, they would almost
                            certainly expend whatever resources were necessary to seize these
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that in any
                            event the United States must now make its position crystal clear. We
                            must decide now on what territories to hold, and hold them. He did not
                            believe that we could give up all the offshore islands. We could give up
                            the northern Tachen group and perhaps also the central Matsu group. This
                            would leave us with the bare bones of Quemoy. This, however, we must
                            certainly keep, or else we should be faced with a very serious situation
                            all the way from Tokyo to Saigon. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> said that he would go as far as to fight for
                            Formosa, and at the same time would make clear that the only reason that
                            we were holding on was to assist in the defense of Formosa. But just as
                            soon as the Chinese <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0109"/>Communists
                            renounced their intention of attacking Formosa, he would abandon
                            Quemoy.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he wished to ask Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> a question: Suppose, in the
                            course of our movements, <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> should tell us that he was prepared to abandon
                            these offshore islands. What effect would such a move have on the U.S.
                            strategic position in this area? Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that he would favor holding on to these
                            islands if we really meant to defend Formosa, because of the importance
                            of their location at the harbor entrances of Amoy and Fuchow. To lose
                            these islands would make the defense of Formosa a great deal more
                            difficult, even though the U.S. Chiefs of Staff have agreed that their
                            retention was not vital to the defense of Formosa. The islands, added
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, were especially
                            important for our air reconnaissance of China.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that it seemed possible to him that we could word
                            our intentions respecting these islands in such fashion as not to tie
                            ourselves down on them forever. On the other hand, he simply could not
                            believe that it was possible to go to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName>, ask him to give up every single one of
                            these islands, and then expect him to turn around and defend Formosa
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> explained that a
                            practical problem had arisen in his mind. If the Chinese Communists go
                            ahead with additional military action against the offshore islands, do
                            we or do we not supply military equipment to the Chinese Nationalists to
                            replace their combat losses? Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> explained to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> that it was present policy to
                            replace such losses.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then inquired
                            of the Secretary of State whether there was any way by which we could
                            force action in the United Nations designed to stabilize the situation
                            on the offshore islands. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> explained to Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that we had held off on the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action because both the British
                            and the Chinese Nationalists, for quite opposite reasons, desired a
                            delay. Moreover, until recently there had been no heavy Chinese
                            Communist military operations against these islands. Now, however, we
                            can move pretty quickly in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> if we
                            desire to. He had to admit, however, that the Congressional leaders with
                            whom he had talked earlier had not shown much enthusiasm for the
                            proposed action in the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, the President suggested that the following was the best
                            course of action for the Council: Arrange another short meeting of the
                            Council between nine and ten tomorrow morning before the Cabinet
                            meeting, and have ready for his consideration the precise sequence of
                            actions to be taken to carry out Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ proposal, as well as the list of individuals who
                            were to carry out these actions. By tomorrow morning the President
                            believed that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0110"/>could produce such documents,
                            since he would have heard from both <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>. The
                            President said he did very much want the British to go along with us
                            because, after all, in a crisis they were good sturdy old allies.
                            Moreover, upon thinking it over, <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> himself might come to have a different feeling
                            over the abandonment of some of these islands, inasmuch as by this new
                            course of action he would have the United States firmly tied in with
                            him.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, said the Vice President, the Council should bear in
                            mind the problem of Congressional opinion. Congressman
                                <persName>McCormack</persName>’s comment with respect to the
                            President’s having sufficient authority already to defend these offshore
                            islands, appeared to the Vice President to indicate the likelihood that
                            politics would be played by some members of Congress. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was in
                            agreement that you might well have a revolt on your hands in the
                            Congress if the Administration proposed to abandon all the offshore
                            islands. The President agreed, and said that there was hardly a word
                            which the people of this country feared more than the term “Munich”.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that he
                            would have ready by tomorrow morning at nine o’clock a draft of the
                            President’s statement to the Congress. The President again expressed
                            grave doubts as to the wisdom of any personal appearance before
                            Congress. What we wanted to stress, he said, was the continuity of our
                            policy, and not to indicate by his appearance some sudden new
                            departure.</p>

                        <p>The situation in the Far East leads me to ask the Congress for authority
                            to employ the armed services of the United States, if necessary, to
                            insure the security of Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>Since the end of Japanese hostilities, these islands have been in the
                            friendly hands of the Republic of China. Also, it has been recognized by
                            the United States that it was important for the security of the United
                            States that these islands should remain in friendly hands. In June 1950,
                            when the Communists committed armed aggression in Korea, President
                            Truman ordered our Seventh Fleet to defend Formosa from possible
                            invasion from the Communist mainland. Last December we signed a Mutual
                            Defense Treaty with the Republic of China covering Formosa and the
                            Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists have recently embarked upon active military
                            operations which they assert are designed for the avowed purpose of
                            conquering Formosa by force.</p>
                        <p>In September 1954 they opened up intensive artillery fire upon the island
                            of Quemoy, approximately 125 (?)<note n="2" xml:id="d24fn2">As in the
                                source text.</note> miles due west of Formosa. This island had
                            theretofore been peacefully held by the Republic of China for
                            approximately five years. This aggressive activity was followed by air
                            attacks of mounting intensity against other islands, notably those in
                            the vicinity of the Tachen group approximately 200 miles north of
                            Formosa. One of these islands (Ichiang) was seized as the result of an
                            intensive air and sea operation on January 18. There have been recent
                            heavy air attacks against the main Tachen Islands themselves.</p>
                        <p>Such attacks are related by the Communists themselves to their purpose to
                            conquer Formosa. Thus, following the seizure of Ichiang, the Peiping
                            Radio said “the victory shows that the Chinese people are unshakeable in
                            their determined will to fight for the liberation of Taiwan (Formosa).
                            Our people will use all their strength to fulfill that task.”</p>
                        <p>In the light of the announced plans of the Chinese Communists to retake
                            Formosa by force, it is essential for the United States to <pb n="84"
                                xml:id="pg_84" facs="0112"/>make sure that war does not occur by
                            reason of any possible miscalculations of our intentions. In the
                            interest of peace, the United States must remove any doubt regarding our
                            intentions or our willingness to fight, if necessary, to preserve our
                            vital interests in Formosa and the Pescadores. This requires not only
                            Presidential action but also Congressional action.</p>
                        <p>Under existing conditions, in the interest of its own security, the
                            United States must undertake several actions for the safety of Formosa
                            and the Pescadores: <list>

                                <item>It must assist the Republic of China to regroup its forces.
                                    Many of these are scattered throughout the smaller offshore
                                    islands as a result of historical rather than military reasons.
                                    Since many of these forces are exposed to vastly superior air
                                    power they can probably not be redeployed without assistance of
                                    the armed forces of the United States.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Under present conditions two groups of islands now held by the
                                    Republic of China would constitute useful stepping-stones in the
                                    hands of the Communists if they are determined to pursue their
                                    design to conquer Formosa. These are the Quemoy Islands, which
                                    dominate Amoy Harbor, and the Matsu Islands, which are outside
                                    of the Foochow Harbor. These two harbors, directly opposite
                                    Formosa, would be most useful in mounting a direct attack
                                    against Formosa as threatened by the Chinese Communists. In the
                                    light of the present threat of attack against Formosa, the
                                    United States must be prepared to join in denying control of
                                    these islands by the Chinese Communists until the peace and
                                    security of the area are reasonably assured by international
                                    conditions created by the United Nations or otherwise.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing facts, I ask the Congress for prompt but limited
                            authority to use the armed forces of the United States, if necessary,
                            for the purpose of securing Formosa and the Pescadores against armed
                            attack. This authority should have the limited scope I have
                            indicated.</p>
                        <p>Because I believe that the present danger, if it is faced firmly, may
                            prove temporary, I suggest that the authority accorded me should also be
                            limited in time. It might well expire on June 30, 1956, or whenever
                            earlier I am able to report to the Congress that the peace and security
                            of the area are reasonably assured by international conditions created
                            by the United Nations or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>No doubt I already possess some of the authority which I request, and I
                            shall not hesitate to exercise it if emergency conditions make this seem
                            important from the standpoint of the welfare and security of the United
                            States. However, in this matter it should be made evident that the full
                            authority of the Congress is behind whatever has to be done to preserve
                            the peace and security of Formosa. The very fact that the full power of
                            government is thus made manifest <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85" facs="0113"
                            />will itself be a factor in deterring those who otherwise might be
                            disposed to challenge the position of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Let me make my position crystal clear: I do not now suggest that the
                            United States should permanently enlarge its defensive obligations
                            beyond Formosa and the Pescadores. That was the present area of mutual
                            concern which was agreed upon as between the Republic of China and
                            ourselves. That, unhappily, is the danger if armed attack directed
                            against that area now confronts us. The existence of that danger
                            requires us to take into account closely related areas which might to an
                            important degree contribute to the failure or the success of such an
                            attack. The offensive military purpose of the Chinese Communists has
                            been made unmistakably clear not merely by words but by deeds. Thus, the
                            issue has been presented by their choice, not ours. Just as they created
                            that issue, so they can end it.</p>
                        <p>The situation which has been created by the Chinese Communists is
                            obviously one which has led to international friction and may indeed
                            constitute a threat to the peace within the meaning of the Charter of
                            the United Nations. Therefore, we would welcome action by the United
                            Nations which might, in fact, bring an end to active hostilities in the
                            area.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, let me emphasize that which I seek is no declaration of
                            war nor what, in my opinion, will lead to war. That is far from my
                            purpose. I seek authority for a limited use for a limited time of the
                            Armed Forces of the United States in order to create a position of
                            strength and security in a vital area that is openly challenged. I
                            believe that making our position clear offers the best hope of
                            diminishing the challenge. Such a contribution by the United States is
                            needed to prevent grave miscalculations by our enemies, and indeed by
                            our friends. If that miscalculation occurred, it would encourage further
                            aggression and might lead ultimately to the war which we are determined
                            by every honorable means to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Our purpose is peace. We know that peace is not gained by ambiguous
                            policies. Therefore, I intend, with your help, to clarify our purposes.
                            In doing so we shall at all times remain faithful to our obligations as
                            a member of the United Nations to be ready to settle our international
                            disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and
                            security, and justice, are not endangered.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> who had called at his
                            request opened the conversation by saying that he had now received a
                            reply from London based on a Cabinet Meeting that morning. The British
                            Government is disturbed by developments. They had thought it was our
                            common objective to work to a situation under which the Chinese
                            Communists accepted a separation of Formosa from the mainland and the
                            Chinese Nationalists abandoned the off-shore islands. The Cabinet did
                            not like the idea of a “provisional guarantee” of Quemoy believing that
                            its lack of clarity would confuse all parties and that furthermore it
                            would encourage the Nationalists to hang on to the coastal islands. The
                            Cabinet had considered the Secretary’s provisos that the “provisional
                            guarantee” should last only until the Communists had acquiesced to the
                            terms of our treaty with Formosa or until the United Nations took some
                            effective action. On the first point London felt that as long as the
                            Nationalists held Quemoy the Communists could never be brought to accept
                            the treaty. On the second point they felt that as long as the
                            Nationalists continued to hold Quemoy the minimum Communist cooperation
                            necessary to the success of <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> could never
                            be secured. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> went on to
                            say that the British Government had always been in favor of United
                            Nations intervention in the situation and accordingly they were ready to
                            move at once on <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> (subject to New Zealand
                            concurrence) if the United States would withhold its proposed
                            provisional guarantee of Quemoy. If the latter is impossible then the
                            Cabinet felt that the fundamental basis for <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi> had changed and the entire matter would require
                            reconsideration. British public opinion, it was felt, would find it
                            difficult to accept the operation on the changed basis. Lastly,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> recalled the Secretary
                            saying that Quemoy could not be defended except with the use of atomic
                                weapons.<note n="2" xml:id="d25fn2">The reference is apparently to a
                                conversation between <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> in London on
                                September 17, 1954. According to <persName corresp="#p_MLT1"
                                    >Merchant</persName>’s notes of the conversation, the Secretary
                                commented that an argument against U.S. defense of Quemoy was that
                                “all out assault might carry Q[uemoy] unless A-bomb used tactically
                                in last resort”; see <ref target="frus1952-54v14p1#pg_650"><hi

                                    corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> discussed the offshore islands
                                problem on subsequent occasions between September and December 1954,
                                records of those conversations in the Department of State files do
                                not indicate any similar comment by the Secretary.</note>
                            <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0115"/><persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>’s question was whether Quemoy was sufficiently
                            vital to risk such wide-reaching developments.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that the term “provisional guarantee” was more
                            formalistic than intended. If he had used the expression himself it
                            connoted a legalism which he had not intended. He went on to say that so
                            long as the Communists continued to profess that their present actions
                            are merely preliminary moves for the conquest of Formosa, then it was
                            important that the U.S. promptly clarify its position in the area. If
                            the Tachens are evacuated and no other move made or explanation given,
                            the impression will be that of a collapse in position. The consequences
                            he foresaw in Japan, Korea, the Philippines and very possibly throughout
                            all of Southeast Asia would be extremely serious. The interpretation
                            which would gain currency was that the U.S. was vague until its
                            interests were attacked and then did nothing. The Communists were making
                            it extremely hard for the U.S. to adopt and maintain a moderate
                            position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he did not know if it would be possible to hold
                            back publicly with respect to Quemoy while the evacuation of the Tachens
                            and <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> were going ahead. The Communists’
                            air was extremely active and moreover the Communists might well
                            attribute the self-control which we were exercising in the matter of the
                            Air Force prisoners as weakness on the part of the U.S. If we could get
                            a temporary <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> injunction that would be
                            fine but the chances were probably against our ability to secure it.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador replied by asking that if <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi> was launched on Monday in the Security Council and one
                            of the first actions were to be to invite the Chinese Communists to
                            attend, would they actually come? He suggested that the fact of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> intervention might well hold the position
                            on morale in the area, to which the Secretary had referred, for a time.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action in fact produced no hope
                            for a solution, then a new judgment would be required.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that it
                            had been our conception from the first consideration of <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> that the result would have been a
                            standstill leaving the Nationalists in control of the off-shore islands.
                            It had not been our view that a result of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi> would be the giving up of these islands by the
                            Nationalists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> agreed and said that he
                            had referred to the ultimate result rather than the immediate one. He
                            went on to say that the Embassy and the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>
                            <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Delegation had gone over the <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> papers and said they still appeared
                            appropriate. He asked what the <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0116"
                            />situation in recent hours had been in the Tachens and the British were
                            told that there had been no significant change.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out, however, that the situation could become
                            critical in a very few days, particularly since the Nationalists now
                            assume (and the Communists presumably as well) that the U.S. will do
                            nothing to assist the defense of the Tachens.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> inquired as to our
                            thoughts with respect to taking diplomatic action in Moscow and Peiping
                            as an accompaniment to <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that it had
                            been earlier agreed to notify the two Communist governments only a few
                            hours before the institution of the Security Council action.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> inquired if it would be
                            possible to inform Moscow and Peiping privately through diplomatic
                            channels of our intended support of Quemoy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MLT1">Merchant</persName> pointed out that one
                            difficulty of such a private warning was that if it were successful the
                            public impression would be one of Communist restraint rather than
                            resolution on the part of the U.S.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> noted that a great
                            deal in the whole operation depended on long-term purposes of the
                            U.S.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we had no long-term purpose or interest beyond
                            Formosa and the Pescadores but that if they were threatened with attack,
                            we were heavily dependent upon the state of Nationalist morale. They
                            have 350,000 troops on the island and our thinking has been that in any
                            necessary defense of Formosa, our contribution would be sea and air. If
                            the morale of the Nationalists is so low that their troops would not
                            fight then we presumably would have to furnish them. The Secretary then
                            referred to the necessity of the President securing Congressional
                            authority.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> inquired if it might
                            not be possible to make our intended action with respect to Quemoy
                            dependent upon the success or failure of action in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> The Secretary replied that it might be
                            possible to be less specific than now planned in our public statement
                            but that it was necessary to make clear to the Nationalists our
                            intentions regarding Quemoy. It would then also be necessary to tell the
                            Communists so that they made no miscalculations. He would give the
                            matter further thought.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that in
                            this matter we were taking into account not only the question of the
                            morale of the Nationalists but the morale throughout all of free
                            Asia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted that if in fact the action in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> was successful, the U.S. decision with
                            respect to the defense of Quemoy would never need to be implemented. He
                            added that his reference to the use of atomic weapons in his
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony
                                Eden</persName> related only to the most extreme hypothesis of the
                            Communists <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0117"/>attacking Quemoy in so
                            heavy a human wave as to make it impossible to stop them with ordinary
                            firing power. He felt that this was a remote possibility. (At this
                            remark <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> exchanged a glance and
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> made what was
                            obviously a verbatim note.) <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> then inquired whether we considered that an air
                            attack on Formosa would bring our treaty into effect.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had considered that that sort of battle
                            would normally<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">The word “normally” was
                                inserted in <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’

                            and the Communists and that the U.S. would stay out unless the attacks
                            were so heavy as to threaten the defensibility of Formosa.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d25fn4">The phrase originally read: “to threaten the

                        <p>The Secretary then concluded the conversation by saying that he would
                            like to consider overnight whether or not we could shape our plans so as

                                    reservation in regard to Paragraph 5:</p>
                                <p>“We believe that it would be almost impossible under the
                                    circumstances assumed here to convince the Chinese Communists
                                    that the exercise of their capability to take Quemoy or their
                                    attack on Matsu would result in full-scale war with the US, and
                                    we therefore believe that such attacks would be likely over the
                                    longer run.” (Department of State, <gloss target="#t_SP1"

                            had been prepared as a matter of urgency the previous evening, and
                            represented an uncoordinated <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>
                            estimate (copy filed in the minutes of the meeting). The general tone
                            was not optimistic on the reaction to be anticipated if the course of
                            action suggested at the previous day’s meeting of the National Security
                            Council by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> were
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>The President said he was not surprised by the conclusions of the
                            estimate, and asked if there were any questions. There being no
                            questions, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called on
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> to report on the
                            latest developments and future actions regarding the new proposal as to
                            the Nationalist-held offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> explained that he
                            had had a talk with the British Ambassador yesterday evening. There had
                            been a meeting of the British Cabinet yesterday in London to discuss the
                            course of action proposed by the United States. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that he was not certain yet
                            as to the precise position taken by the British Cabinet, but two points
                            seemed fairly clear. In the first place, the British Government was
                            reluctant to see the United States take this proposed step relative to
                            the offshore islands. The reluctance stemmed, apparently, from the
                            British feeling that in order to make this commitment stick, we might be
                            obliged to use atomic weapons in order to hold the Quemoys and the Matsu
                            Islands. The British were always very sensitive about this subject.
                            Secondly, the British felt that if there were to be a public declaration
                            at this stage regarding the U.S. course <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91"
                                facs="0119"/>of action, the decision would be irrevocable, and
                            efforts to stabilize the situation in the United Nations would prove
                            futile.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, while the British might not like this program,
                            they would probably be willing to go along with it if it involved the
                            President’s going to Congress to seek authority generally to use the
                            armed forces of the United States in the defense of Formosa, without
                            publicly identifying those offshore islands which the United States
                            would help to defend. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> felt, however, that this latter point should be
                            made clear privately to both the Chinese Nationalists and the Chinese
                            Communists. In these circumstances the British might be willing to go
                            ahead with the program for action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to say
                            that in the course of working on the Presidential statement to Congress,
                            he had come to the conclusion that it would be best not to nail the flag
                            to the mast by a detailed statement respecting our plans and intentions
                            on evacuating or holding certain of these islands. This matter could be
                            covered by informing the Chinese Nationalists exactly what we have in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>The President then informed the Council that he had talked with
                                <persName>Joe Martin</persName> and the Speaker of the House
                            yesterday morning.<note n="4" xml:id="d26fn4">Described here is a
                                telephone conversation that took place the previous afternoon
                                between the President and Representative <persName>Martin</persName>
                                and Speaker Rayburn. (Memorandum of telephone conversation at 2:40
                                p.m., January 20, 1955, not signed but probably prepared by the
                                President’s personal secretary, <persName>Ann C. Whitman</persName>;
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library,
                                Whitman File, DDE Diaries)</note> Mr. <persName>Rayburn</persName>
                            had reflected Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName>’s opinions. In general,
                            he had said that the President had all the powers he needed to deal with
                            the situation, and that whatever the President decided to do would be
                            unequivocally backed by the House of Representatives. He believed,
                            however, that a joint resolution at this particular moment would be
                            unwise because the President would be saying in effect that he did not
                            have the power to act instantly, and a filibuster could start in the
                            Congress, causing dissension both in the Congress and throughout the
                            country. Accordingly, it was the Speaker’s advice that the President
                            take whatever action he deemed necessary, and thereafter ask for
                            Congressional approval of such action. Speaker Rayburn guaranteed that
                            this approval would go through the House in 45 minutes, without a word
                            of criticism of the President.</p>
                        <p>The President went on to say that in talking this matter over with the
                            Secretary of State, he and the Secretary had believed that they could do
                            a lot of things as a mere matter of course, but that we must at all
                            costs avoid another Yalu River sanctuary situation in any struggle over
                            Quemoy. The President said he was absolutely determined on this point.
                            Accordingly, he had concluded that we must get a line of action clearly
                            in mind, including all the sequential steps. He <pb n="92"
                                xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>believed that we could do what we wanted
                            to do with regard to these islands without being too specific in the
                            statement to Congress. On the specific side, the President said that if
                            we went to Congress for authority to defend the Formosa area generally,
                            the proposal would have a tremendous effect. This would also provide
                            time in which to let the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action get
                            off the ground. If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> does not get
                            off the ground in time, we will have to follow up with this new policy
                            decision. In any case, we will have to let the Chinese Nationalists know
                            about this decision. The President then inquired whether anything had
                            been heard as yet from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied that nothing but an unofficial radio [<hi
                                rend="italic">telephone</hi>?] report had been heard from the
                            Foreign Minister.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that it
                            was clear in his mind that the President’s intention was to withdraw
                            from the Tachen Islands. But do we withdraw from Quemoy and the other
                            offshore islands?</p>
                        <p>The President explained to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> that our ultimate objective was to defend
                            Formosa and the Pescadores. The other offshore islands were incidental
                            to this objective. He therefore contemplated no permanent extension of
                            the defense area of Formosa. We will continue to defend these islands
                            until some other arrangements can be made to quiet the Formosa area. We
                            would then get out of the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> suggested that it
                            might be wise to emphasize that our ultimate objective is stability in
                            the Far East, with Formosa in friendly hands. The President replied to

                            affirmative, and then proceeded to read the opening sentences of a draft
                            statement to the Congress which had been prepared by Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.<note n="5" xml:id="d26fn5">It
                                is not clear whether the reference is to the draft printed as <ref
                                    target="#d24">Document 24</ref>, or to a revision

                            feel he needed additional authority in order to evacuate Chinese
                            Nationalist garrisons from certain of the offshore islands. However, if
                            in the course of such action we were obliged to attack the Chinese
                            Communists, the President felt that he might need additional authority.
                            On the other hand, he did not wish to specify the precise details of why
                            he needed such extra authority.</p>
                        <p>In some anxiety, the Attorney General<note n="6" xml:id="d26fn6"
                                    ><persName corresp="#p_BHJ1">Herbert Brownell,
                                Jr.</persName></note> inquired whether the President intended to
                            change his plan to seek additional authority from the Congress. The
                            Attorney General thought it still highly desirable to seek this
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>The President assured the Attorney General that he had not changed his
                            ideas on this subject, and asked the Secretary of State to go on reading
                            the draft statement to the Congress. However, the Vice <pb n="93"
                                xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>President interrupted to state that he
                            did not agree to the position taken by Speaker Rayburn as the President
                            had earlier outlined it. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> added that he also thought it more desirable for
                            the President to seek from Congress additional authority for the use of
                            the armed forces of the United States. The President said he agreed,
                            although he was opposed to any personal appearance before the Congress
                            and preferred simply to send a written statement.</p>
                        <p>Continuing on the subject of the Rayburn view, the Vice President said he
                            very much doubted any likelihood of a filibuster in the Senate. If, on
                            the other hand, the President did not go before the Congress with a
                            request for additional authority, and then “moved in” on the situation
                            in the offshore islands, he would be drawing a parallel with the action
                            in 1950 on Korea. “Some of the boys on our side” would be certain to
                            pick this up and use it against the President by arguing in effect that
                            he was doing precisely what President Truman did in June 1950. So, the
                            Vice President concluded, even if the President found himself obliged to
                            act before the joint resolution went through Congress, it would be
                            better at least to have asked for Congressional authority. Moreover, the
                            Vice President was sure that Congress would move promptly to pass the
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then proceeded to
                            read the remainder of the proposed statement by the President,
                            concluding his reading amidst murmurs of approval. The President said
                            that of course the document would need a little more editing. He hadn’t
                            seen this version until last midnight. Words were extremely important in
                            this cold war situation. The Presidential statement must be temperate
                            and exact, but also it must reveal our firm intention. That’s the best
                            kind of a notice before the world, and if it gets genuine support from
                            the Congress, such support would be worth a lot of additional armed
                            forces. Accordingly we must be very careful in our choice of words.</p>
                        <p>After the President and other members of the Council had discussed
                            certain sentences in the proposed statement, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired of the President how
                            long it would take the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> to reach a
                            decision if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> did undertake action
                            to stabilize the situation. Would it be a matter of weeks or months?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that such
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would take at least a
                            month. The President expressed the belief that a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action would not have much influence on the course of
                            action that the United States would have to undertake at once. On the
                            other hand, such <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would have
                            great influence on world opinion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> insisted that
                            the Quemoy problem had got to be settled. That was the dagger point. The
                            President replied that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> made a mistake in assuming that Quemoy was the
                            Chinese Communist objective. It was not; they were after Formosa.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> denied this,
                            and said that he was assuming, <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"
                            />rather, that Quemoy was a point which the United States would find it
                            impossible to defend for any great length of time. The President said
                            that it would be OK with him if the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            succeeds in achieving a solution which will enable the United States to
                            get out of Quemoy without risk to Formosa. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that it was still
                            going to be hard to explain to the American people why we were finding
                            it necessary to hold on to Quemoy. In some exasperation, the President
                            said to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that
                            he sat in this room time after time with the maps all around him, and a
                            look at the geography of the area would explain why we have to hold
                            Quemoy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> commented that no
                            matter how the Presidential statement were worded, the action that the
                            President proposed to take was of an extraordinary and momentous
                            character. He was accordingly much concerned about the inflationary and
                            similar influences which the President’s statement would set in motion
                            in the country as soon as its text became public. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_FAS1">Flemming</persName> therefore advised that
                            language should be put into the statement to indicate that the proposed
                            action would not involve any stepping up in the currently-approved level
                            of the armed forces or in currently-approved mobilization measures. The
                            President agreed heartily with Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                                >Flemming</persName>’s suggestion.</p>
                        <p>After further discussion of various points made in the draft statement,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> turned to a
                                draft,<note n="7" xml:id="d26fn7">Not identified.</note> which had
                            been prepared by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>,
                            chief law officer of the State Department, and Assistant Attorney
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName>,<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d26fn8">J. Lee Rankin, Assistant Attorney General for the
                                Office of Legal Counsel.</note> of the Congressional resolution.</p>
                        <p>The President thought the draft of the proposed joint resolution was a
                            good one, although it contained no hint as to actions that had been
                            taken hitherto in using our armed forces to defend Formosa since
                            President Truman had decreed this in his order to the Seventh Fleet. The
                            President, in the course of a discussion of the text of the joint
                            resolution, said he favored keeping its text general enough to allow him
                            the necessary freedom of action.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said he was
                            fearful lest there be any unnecessary limitation of the powers of the
                            Commander-in-Chief, in view of the contingencies that the United States
                            faced in the future. The President said he agreed with this, but
                            reminded Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> that it
                            was also essential, if possible, to avoid a split in Congressional and
                            public opinion. The President said that all might be sure of one
                            thing—namely, that he would do in an emergency whatever had to be done
                            to protect the vital interests of the United States. He would do this
                            even if his actions should be interpreted as acts of war. He would
                            rather be impeached than fail to do his duty.</p>
                        <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0123"/>
                        <p>The President then inquired when the statement to the Congress would be
                            sent up. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> hoped
                            that the final text might be ready to send up by Monday, and the
                            President suggested that it be sent as soon as it was ready.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> then said that he
                            was in a position to make a brief comment on the current situation on
                            the main Tachen Islands. There was no action, and only a few junks in
                            the harbor. The morale of the Chinese Nationalist soldiers was said to
                            be good, but the commanding general, Liu Lien-I, was said to be in the
                            depths of despair. There was some possibility that he might sell out to
                            the Chinese Communists after our <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>
                            was out, and all our people have now been evacuated. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then predicted that with good
                            leadership the Nationalist garrison would put up a good fight. It might
                            prove necessary, however, to get rid of this Nationalist commander in
                            the Tachens. Since the weather was bad, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> thought no Chinese Communist attack likely over
                            the next few days.</p>

                        <p>At the outset the Secretary informed the British Ambassador that he had
                            presented the views of the British Government to the President before
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting this morning. He said
                            that at the <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0125"/><gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting it was agreed that there would
                            be no statement publicly made regarding the intentions of the United
                            States with respect to Quemoy and the Matsu Islands. The Secretary said
                            that the President intends to go before Congress on Monday to ask for
                            Congressional authority for the limited use of United States military
                            forces. At this point the Secretary read certain key paragraphs from the
                            President’s draft message<note n="2" xml:id="d27fn2">Apparently a
                                revision of the draft printed as <ref target="#d24">Document
                                    24</ref>.</note> (warning that this text could not be regarded
                            as final but could be accepted as indicating the general approach).</p>
                        <p>The points in the message specifically elaborated on by the Secretary
                            were (1) the statement regarding our intention to assist the Chinese
                            Nationalists to regroup their forces the better to defend Formosa; (2)
                            the statement regarding the matter of further authority to strike at
                            forces patently grouped for an attack against Formosa; (3) the statement
                            to the effect that it was not being suggested that the treaty area of
                            our defensive concern was being enlarged; and (4) the reference to the
                            fact that the United States would welcome action by the United Nations
                            which would moderate or eliminate the existing danger.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then went on to say that the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> had adopted as a policy (which would not be made public
                            at this time) the need for preparedness to act against the mainland in
                            the event of concentrations directed at Formosa. The Secretary
                            emphasized that it was our intention to try to avoid any action against
                            the mainland during the period in which the United Nations might be
                            making a serious effort to settle the difficulty. He said that obviously
                            no absolute promise could be given with respect to such restraint.</p>
                        <p>Finally the Secretary said that he hoped the British Government would
                            consider that we had substantially met the points which they had raised
                            and that it would thereby be enabled promptly to support <hi

                        <p>The Secretary then said that he desired to comment on one sentence (“This
                            is on the understanding that the final objective is to work slowly
                            towards a state of affairs in which Formosa and the Pescadores are
                            protected from attack, and at the same time, restrained from launching
                            attacks; while the importance of the offshore islands steadily
                            diminishes and they are finally allowed to pass to the control of the

                                    already agreed, if the United States Government is prepared to
                                    withhold any promise of help in the defence of Quemoy until the
                                    results of the action in the Security Council are known.</p>
                                <p>“This is on the understanding that the final objective is to work

                            commitment with respect to the reference that the offshore islands
                            should finally be allowed to pass to the control of the mainland
                            government. He said whereas this might be in the British minds it
                            definitely was not in ours. He said that major problems such as the
                            difficulty over the Saar frequently could diminish in importance if they
                            were considered and settled in a larger context, e.g., a close
                            rapprochement of Germany and France. Accordingly he accepted the
                            possibility that the offshore islands which now constitute so dangerous
                            an area might diminish in importance if the larger issues surrounding
                            them could be eased or settled.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador then thanked the Secretary for the information he

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert Scott</persName> then injected
                            the thought that if <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> is to have a chance
                            to succeed the Communists themselves must give it a fair wind.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we would do our best to allay Nationalist
                            activities while the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was seized with
                            the matter but there was the matter of reciprocity and obviously they
                            could not be inactive in the face of stepped-up Communist attacks.
                            Reference was made to the sinking of a small British ship in recent days
                            by Nationalist bomber attacks on Swatow harbor. The Secretary said that
                            it was his impression that the ship was owned by the Communists but
                            under British registry. The British Ambassador said he thought it was
                            under charter to Chinese Communists and indicated that this matter <pb
                                n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0127"/>should not be too important
                            though no doubt he will be instructed to protest.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then read a short extract from a cable just received from
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName><note n="5"
                                xml:id="d27fn5">Telegram 474 from Taipei, January 21, reported that

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>’s hands for approval, would accept
                                the evacuation proposal “with reluctance” but oppose a cease-fire;
                                questions which might be expected included whether or not the
                                evacuation proposal had any connection with <persName

                            indicating that the Chinese Nationalists feared that there was a
                            connection between the <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> efforts to secure the release of our airmen
                            and the projected evacuation of the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador then raised on a personal basis the question of
                            what might be done in the way of talking plainly to Moscow and Peiping
                            at the time <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> was initiated. The
                            Secretary confined himself to saying that we were planning to inform

                            on the situation and our intended actions so that as occasion warranted
                            he could inform the Soviet Government.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> explained that the
                            Chinese Government’s response to the position stated by the Secretary in
                            their discussions on January 19 had been somewhat delayed, becuase of
                            certain questions which Taipei had wished to get clear first. However, a
                            cable was now being decoded at the Chinese Embassy, which he had
                            requested be delivered over here as soon as possible.</p>
                        <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0128"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that one question
                            raised by Taipei was whether action would be taken in the United Nations
                            before or after withdrawal from the Tachen Islands? Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> had told Taipei that he had
                            understood the Secretary to say that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            action would be taken after withdrawal from the Tachens. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said his Government saw no need
                            for a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> resolution following a
                            withdrawal from the Tachens, and possibly from Matsu. The Chinese
                            Government would not try to re-take these positions after
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he had not been specific on the question of
                            timing of the two actions. Action in the United Nations was not a matter
                            which we could control, while timing of withdrawal from the Tachens
                            depended on the military situation and on how long it would take to make
                            the necessary preparations. We had already started to move carriers from
                            the Manila area in the direction of Okinawa. We can’t be sure what
                            precise time relationship there would be between withdrawal from the
                            Tachens and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration of a
                            cease-fire resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he wanted to inform Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> of what our program was. He said that the President
                            was planning to send a message to Congress asking for authority to use
                            U.S. forces in and around Formosa for these purposes: <list>
                                <label>(1).</label>
                                <item>If requested by the Chinese Government, to be ready to assist
                                    in the regrouping and consolidation of Chinese Forces in the
                                    Formosa area. The Secretary pointed out that the Chinese held
                                    certain off-shore islands for historical reasons rather than for
                                    military reasons, and that a regrouping and consolidation of
                                    these positions would be desirable from a military
                                    standpoint.</item>
                                <label>(2).</label>
                                <item>To further the defense of Formosa by being prepared to strike
                                    rapidly against hostile attack. There might not be time to
                                    consult Congress after a hostile attack had been identified as
                                    such.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Secretary read portions of the draft message to Congress but
                            emphasized that the language was tentative and that he was planning to
                            discuss it further with the President this afternoon. The message would
                            make clear that the President was seeking authority to use U.S. armed
                            forces in the Formosa area for non-provocative purposes in order to meet
                            developments which might necessitate their use in the coming hours. It
                            was not proposed to enlarge the area the United States was committed to
                            defend.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that
                            it had now been decided that the United States would be prepared to
                            assist in the defense of Matsu as well as Quemoy. However, no public
                            declaration would be made at present in this respect. He was simply
                            informing Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> so that the
                            Chinese Government would know what the U.S. present intentions were. The
                            Secretary said that in his opinion the message to Congress asking for
                            authority to use armed forces in the Formosa area would <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0129"/>have an electrifying effect throughout
                            the world and we would want to see what its effect would be before
                            making any further statement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked whether the
                            message would not mention Quemoy and Matsu?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reaffirmed that it would not mention these territories by
                            name.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> commented that the
                            message seemed to him excellent. He had one point to raise, however. He
                            wondered if the use of the word “regrouping” could be avoided. He did
                            not know how it would sound in translation. Perhaps it could be stated
                            “in the event of regrouping”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that it
                            was simply a question of withdrawal from nonstrategic to strategic
                            positions. This amounted to strengthening of the Chinese position.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> had asked whether it
                            would be possible for U.S. forces to support the Chinese in defending
                            the Tachens while the islands were being evacuated. The Chinese garrison
                            could not pull out immediately, since there were no adequate docking
                            facilities in the Tachen harbor. The <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> wanted to know whether we would help in
                            fighting a rear-guard action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he knew the harbor in the Tachens was exposed and
                            assured Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that it was
                            our intention to provide cover for evacuation. This meant that we would
                            knock down any Communist planes which would try to interfere.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if he could
                            inform the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> that the
                            U.S. was prepared to participate in rear-guard action on the
                            Tachens.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would protect the evacuation, which meant that
                            we would fight if attacked by the Chinese Communists while evacuation
                            was going on.</p>
                        <p>Returning to his question as to the use of the word “regrouping”, Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> suggested inclusion of
                            the phrase “if and when requested”, in the sentence referring to
                            regrouping in the draft message to Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary noted this suggestion on the draft message.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he had a question
                            as to the timing of an announcement from Taipei as to the withdrawal
                            from the Tachens: Should it be made simultaneously with the announcement
                            of the U.S. intentions respecting Quemoy? The Secretary replied that we
                            were not now intending to make a public announcement as to Quemoy. He
                            suggested that the Chinese announcement might be made at the time of the
                            President’s message to Congress.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked how Congress
                            might react to the message.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that he thought Congressional action would be
                            favorable on the whole. He thought the House action <pb n="102"
                                xml:id="pg_102" facs="0130"/>would be quick as House rules differ
                            from those of the Senate, which permit unlimited debate. The Secretary
                            felt that there might be four or five Senators who might be opposed and
                            this might drag out the debate for a few days. He also pointed out the
                            normal course would be for the draft resolution to go to Committee for
                            hearings. However, he hoped that the resolution would get Wrought the
                            Senate within a week.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> suggested
                            withholding announcement of the Tachens’ evacuation until after
                            Congressional action on the joint resolution. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> pointed out that the Chinese
                            could not make an announcement as to withdrawal from the Tachens on
                            Monday.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed that it would be better to wait until after
                            Congressional action on the proposed joint resolution.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> then asked what the
                            situation was with respect to possible <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was boiling and he would not be surprised
                            if the matter would be brought into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> next week.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that there had
                            been rather stiff reaction in Formosa to the report of possible <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he understood the feeling on Formosa but he
                            thought the odds were 10–1 that the results of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> consideration would benefit the Chinese Nationalist
                            position. He was sure that the Chinese Communists would not come and
                            they would not want to admit that the United Nations had any authority
                            in the matter. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            had reported that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            would not even admit the existence of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Resolution on the imprisoned airmen and refused to
                            discuss the matter with <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> on the basis of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Resolution. The Secretary felt that the Chinese
                            Communists would simply flout the United Nations. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked how the Chinese
                            Communists could possibly accept <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            jurisdiction in this matter when they had refused to accept <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the newspaper accounts of the conference with the
                            Congressional leaders yesterday were terrible, as they made it look as
                            though things were going against the Chinese Nationalists while in fact
                            the program under consideration would have the opposite effect.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> indicated that Taipei
                            had asked his opinion as to what its public position should be in
                            response to the newspaper stories. He said that he had suggested the
                            following two points: 1) that the Chinese Government had not indicated
                            to the U.S. any intention of withdrawing from the Tachens, and 2) that
                            it had not requested the United States for any assistance in withdrawing
                            from these islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to four questions contained in a telegram just
                            received from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"

                                <p>The Secretary said the answer is no. In fact our intelligence
                                    estimate is that the proposed U.S. action will make it less
                                    likely that the prisoners will be released.</p></item>

                                <p>The Secretary said that he had spoken to Senator <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> who said he was
                                    prepared to push the Treaty through rapidly. The Secretary
                                    pointed out that in the President’s message to Congress Monday,
                                    it was also proposed to emphasize the need for a speedy
                                    ratification of the Treaty, which provided the whole framework
                                    for the security of the Formosa area. In reading the language
                                    from the draft message, the Secretary emphasized that this was
                                    only a draft and he couldn’t guarantee this language would be in
                                    the final version.</p>
                                <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he
                                    hoped the amendment he had proposed in the sentence about
                                    regrouping would be left in the message.</p>
                                <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> again
                                    referred to the question of whether Matsu and Quemoy would be
                                    mentioned in the message.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary again said that they would not be mentioned in the
                                    message. However, the National Security Council had made the
                                    decision this morning that it would be U.S. policy to assist in
                                    their defense. This was a matter of U.S. policy and not of
                                    agreement with the Chinese Government, and, therefore, could be
                                    changed by the U.S. just as any other policy.</p>
                                <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if
                                    the President had approved the policy.</p>
                                <p>The Secretary replied in the affirmative.</p></item>

                                <p>The Secretary said that as he had already indicated the carriers
                                    were enroute to the vicinity of Okinawa.</p></item>

                                    question. He wondered if it would be necessary.</p></item>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that he
                            thought the Chinese would not have sufficient transports to make a quick
                            evacuation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that the evacuation would not have to be rapid
                            since the U.S. would participate in defending the Tachens while the
                            evacuation was under way.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> then raised the
                            question of the immediate need for a man from the Pacific Command to go
                            to Formosa. He should be a man who could make decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that this was
                            under Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>’s
                            jurisdiction.</p>

                            indicated that they thought it would be a good idea to have a high-level
                            officer proceed immediately to Formosa. The Secretary suggested that Mr.

                        <p>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, said that he had asked to
                            bring the Chiefs in because of comments they had made regarding proposed
                            action to be taken in Tachen Islands. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> was the spokesman for the
                            group, pointing up the difficulties of evacuation. There are 30,000
                            individuals on the island, civilian and military forces, and apparently
                            a considerable quantity of military equipment. A ship sunk at the
                            entrance to the harbor necessitates lightering all equipment out beyond
                            that spot. (Incidentally, the President during discussion said someone
                            had made a grave error in allowing that situation to exist.) Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>, supported by Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, said that the
                            evacuation would be much more arduous than their defense or
                            reinforcement.</p>
                        <p>Apparently the Joint Chiefs were afraid that the proposed message to the
                            Congress advocated a course of action (evacuation) which they consider
                            unwise and wanted to register with the President the difficulties they
                            foresaw. The President discussed the intent of the message being

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked about the

                                Post</hi>, from the International News Service at Taipei, that the
                            Chinese Government after a Cabinet meeting had officially rejected the
                            American proposals, and were resolved to defend the Tachen Islands.</p>
                        <p>Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said there
                            was nothing to this report. He said there was as much nonsense in the
                            news despatches from Taipei as from Washington.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> summarized a telegram
                            from President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. He said

                            evacuation of the Tachens and the joint defense of Quemoy and Matsu. The
                            Chinese Government accepted the proposals with reluctance, considering a
                            withdrawal from the Tachens to be an undesirable alternative, but the
                            only one left. It was not to the liking of the Chinese Government but
                            the reasons which caused the American Government to recommend it were
                            understood and this solution must be accepted. The <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> observed as to point
                            (2), that the Secretary had not agreed to make any public declaration
                            that the U.S. would participate in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu. On
                            the contrary, the Secretary had stated specifically on January 21, that
                            “no public declaration would be made at present in this respect”. The
                            Secretary had indicated that the President’s message to Congress would
                            ask for authority to use armed force “in the Formosa area”. There would
                            be no further public statement, at least until we saw the effect of the
                            President’s message. It would not be desirable to pin the U.S. action
                            down specifically to certain islands.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he and the
                            Ambassador had fully understood that the President’s message would not
                            refer to Quemoy and Matsu by name. It was the thought of the Chinese
                            representatives that at some future time these two islands might be
                            named. They had assumed that the President’s message would ask for
                            authorization to protect a general area.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that an
                            authorization would be sought to use armed force in the general area as
                            necessary. It should be clearly understood that there was no U.S.
                            commitment to make a public statement specifying certain islands.</p>
                        <p>As to the evacuation of the Tachens, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> felt that it was a military necessity to defer any
                            announcement of intention to withdraw until the withdrawal operation was
                            practically complete. He felt that secrecy could be fairly well
                            maintained. He said it had been done in the case of the evacuation of
                            the small island of Chou Shan, north of the Tachens, some time ago. This
                            had been done by the Chinese Government entirely on its own.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> felt it was doubtful
                            whether knowledge of the evacuation could be kept from the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <pb n="108" xml:id="pg_108" facs="0136"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that his
                            Government wanted to offset the bad effects of the withdrawal from the
                            Tachens. For this reason they were anxious to say something about the
                            defense of Quemoy and Matsu as soon as possible. The Chinese Government
                            would like to indicate that they would be held, and that the U.S. had
                            kindly offered to assist as necessary in holding them. Some positive
                            favorable announcement should be timed with the adverse news of the
                            withdrawal from the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the Department
                            assumed that the Chinese Government would soften the impact of the
                            announcement by describing it as a regrouping operation. The
                            announcement that the U.S. would help to cover the withdrawal would also
                            have a beneficial effect. It was not anticipated that the U.S. would say
                            anything about assisting in evacuation before the Chinese Government
                            announced its intentions. It was estimated that the Congressional debate
                            on the President’s message might take up to a week.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that a few days
                            after Congress has acted, it was hoped that some sort of official
                            statement confirming the President’s readiness to assist the Chinese
                            Government could be made.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said it was important to
                            counteract the erroneous impression that the Chinese Government was
                            prepared to withdraw from all the off-shore islands. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> felt that the timing of all
                            moves should be worked out jointly. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> wanted to make it clear that in
                            his view the evacuation of the Tachens presented a danger which should
                            be clearly recognized:—there would be less control over a Communist
                            surge southward from the Tachen area toward the Formosa Strait. The
                            defense of the Formosa Strait would be adversely affected. For this
                            reason he thought the abandonment of the Tachens would be a mistake.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that our
                            military people did not think so. The Tachens would not be sufficiently
                            important to pay a price for holding, even in war time. They were so
                            much closer to Mainland air bases than to the island air bases available
                            to us that the Communists would always have a great advantage.
                            Furthermore they had little intrinsic importance.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> remarked that this was
                            a matter of dispute. “Strategists, like philosophers, don’t always
                            agree”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed the hope
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> would be
                            made to realize that the recent U.S. decisions represent “a hardening,
                            not a weakening, of U.S. policy”. He felt that possibly the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> did not yet understand
                            the full significance of the recent decisions.</p>
                        <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0137"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he
                            appreciated the purport of the recent U.S. decision. At the same time he
                            felt that the evacuation of the Tachens would have the effect of
                            boosting both the prestige and the appetite of the Chinese Communists.
                            It would tend to lead to further Chinese Communist aggression. Turning
                            to the evacuation problem, he said that the withdrawal of slightly more
                            than 36,000 people from the Tachens would be a big undertaking, full of
                            difficulties. There were no good boat landings. The people would have to
                            go single file down narrow paths to the water’s edge and embark on
                            sampans, which would ferry them out to the ship anchorages. It might
                            take an hour and a half to move an individual from the island to the
                            evacuation ship, even with quiet seas. Careful planning would be needed
                            for the evacuation and for the regrouping on other islands.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that

                            had been designated. U.S. transports would be needed to assist in
                            carrying out the evacuation. If the Chinese Government had to rely
                            chiefly on its own resources, the evacuation would be greatly
                            prolonged.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> felt that these

                            did not anticipate any difficulties over the extent of U.S.

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that only
                            civilians who wanted to leave would be evacuated. There would be no
                            forcible evacuation of unwilling civilians.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> was greatly perturbed
                            by the leakage of classified information to the U.S. press. He knew that
                            the U.S. was also concerned and hoped that everything possible would be
                            done to block the leaks. The <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> felt that the entire matter should be
                            handled so as not to discourage the Chinese people. At the proper moment
                            the Chinese Government would have to issue an explanatory statement. The
                            leakage of information in advance would not make the Government’s task
                            any easier.</p>
                        <p>As to point (5), Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            said that the reports which the Ambassador had mentioned that Secretary

                                xml:id="pg_110" facs="0138"/>He had said nothing on behalf of the
                            U.S. Government, and had informed us that he did not discuss any quid
                            pro quo. The U.S. Government was anxious to hasten the ratification of
                            the Mutual Defense Treaty. The question of the fliers could not be
                            allowed to influence our consideration of the Formosa security problem.
                            The action we are now considering may cause the Communists to harden
                            their attitude towards the Americans under detention. This is
                            regrettable, but it cannot be helped. U.S. action was made necessary by
                            the Chinese Communists attacks on the Tachens and their admission that
                            these attacks were a prelude to the “liberation” of Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said as to point (6)
                            that the U.S. could not oppose the proposed New Zealand Resolution in
                            the Security Council, and we did not see how the Chinese Government
                            could oppose it. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            stressed that if the resolution were contemptuously rejected by the
                            Communist side, the position of the Chinese Government would be
                            improved. He thought the New Zealand resolution would probably go

                                    after the withdrawal of the Chinese Government forces. Communist
                                    use of the Tachens as a military base would pose a serious
                                    additional security threat. He suggested that United Nations
                                    influence be invoked to have the Tachens delcared a “neutral
                                    zone”. This action would not have to be identified with the New
                                    Zealand Resolution.</item>

                                <item>The precise wording of the New Zealand Resolution was very
                                    important. Suitable wording could do much to minimize the
                                    unfortunate aspects of the Resolution. He hoped that New Zealand
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> and
                                    Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> could

                        <p>As to the Foreign Minister’s interest in the wording of the New Zealand
                            Resolution, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed
                            that this was important. It should be phrased so as to make it as
                            acceptable as possible to the Chinese Government. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the interests of
                            the Chinese Government would be borne in mind in our discussions with

                            terms he fears <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> trip
                            was not failure from Red viewpoint.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> does not suggest that in
                            his own opinion there was any direct connection between Hammarskjold
                            Odyssey and proposed Tachen evacuation but he was certain Communists and
                            most others would think so. Timing and sequence such as following would
                            be all but disastrous: (1) <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> trip; (2) Red capture of Ichiang; (3)
                            evacuation of Tachen at US behest; (4) cease-fire proposal in UNO; (5)
                            arrival of new batch of Red Chinese delegates in New York to discuss
                            matters; (6) inevitable broadening of discussions (during which
                            cease-fire as such might well pass into limbo along with US airmen); (7)
                            meanwhile Chinese-American Security Pact still not in effect.</p>
                        <p>President seems convinced Reds would not simply reject ceasefire proposal
                            out of hand but exploit it to utmost. He believes as matter of principle
                            Free China must oppose it firmly.</p>
                        <p>When Red China finally enters UNO, which <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> regards as inevitable result of present trend, US
                            will find that in world organization it has “lost a friend and gained an
                            enemy.”</p>
                        <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> said Free
                            China owed much to US and was ready to make contribution toward
                            obtaining release of airmen from Peiping besides being helpful in other
                            ways, even against its own interest, so long as principles not
                            sacrificed. For example, Tachen was given up to satisfy US. He would be
                            glad to release Soviet tanker <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi> and
                            non-defecting members of crew if this would obtain freedom of US
                            prisoners. (At this point Madame <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> remarked such an offer would put Reds on
                            spot.)</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> noted with wry smile
                            January 20 press despatches from London quoting Foreign Office spokesman
                            as stating cease-fire was “one of a number of possible courses of action
                            which we have discussed with US and New Zealand—over recent months.”
                            This appeared to confirm all his suspicions. He evidently thinks US also
                            has been less than frank with Free China about <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>.</p>
                        <p>At several points during conversation President and Madame emphasized
                            tragic fate of Tachen inhabitants. She is sending ship next week to
                            evacuate guerilla orphans in whom she has taken special interest. When I
                            got up to leave she repeated hope that US would not overlook
                            humanitarian aspects.</p>

                        <p>1152. For the Secretary. London for the Ambassador. At certain time and
                            under certain conditions an approach to Soviet Government on question
                            could be useful and at any rate could do no harm if only for record.
                            However, I believe any such approach must make absolutely clear US
                            position in re to offshore islands and I do not see this clarity in the
                            contents of proposed approach (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                            >Deptel</gloss>s 576 and 577).<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d31fn2">Document 31 and footnote 2
                                thereto</ref>.</note> Offshore islands are chief issue since I am
                            convinced, particularly after signature treaty with Chinese Nationalist
                            Government, there can be no doubt in Soviet mind concerning US intention
                            to defend Formosa and Pescadores in event of attack. Paragraphs 1 and 2
                            of <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 576 could be read to
                            indicate that US would be prepared to use military force in defense of
                            offshore islands as logical extension its commitment to defend Formosa.
                            Paragraph 3 raises in very general form question of withdrawal
                            Nationalist forces from “certain” offshore islands with US assistance if
                            requested by Nationalist China. Paragraphs 4 and 5 do not make clear
                            exactly what action it will be suggested that <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> take to put an end to active hostilities in the area.
                            Thus points listed do not make clear whether chief purpose of statement
                            is to warn that US will use its own forces in relation to Communist
                            attacks on offshore islands or whether emphasis should be on withdrawal
                            Chinese Nationalist forces from some of them.</p>
                        <p>I fully realize complexity and delicacy of these questions and the
                            psychological and political factors involved. I fear, however, approach
                            along lines indicated would not have best chance of producing result
                            desired—namely, exercise of Soviet influence as restraining factor on
                            Communist Chinese—unless greater clarity can be introduced in re to US
                            position on offshore islands question. It may well be that it is
                            impossible to give definite answer on this point at this time, in which
                            case I would suggest that any approach to Soviets be deferred until we
                            have determined (a) whether Chinese Nationalist Government is in effect
                            preparing to request US assistance in withdrawal from certain of the
                            islands, and (b) exactly what islands are involved.</p>
                        <p>Another possibility would be to confine approach to Soviets merely to
                            request contained in paragraph 5: i.e., that Chinese Communists refrain
                            from military action in Formosan Straits while matter under <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration. This, however, to be
                            effective, would involve <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0143"/>our
                            ability to give similar assurances on behalf Chinese Nationalists which
                            is not specifically indicated or authorized in telegram under reference.
                            Exact question of withdrawal and regrouping of Nationalist forces would
                            thus be avoided and left for development during course of <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> consideration.</p>
                        <p>It is not necessary in all cases to dot all I’s for Soviets who are
                            reasonably quick to understand in some matters, but where issues involve
                            territory of any kind and either its defense or relinquishment, clarity
                            is important and even essential. I am sure that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> would ask me questions on
                            offshore islands which under present suggestion I would be unable to
                            answer and thereby leave with him impression that our approach was
                            simply maneuver and not the serious attempt to restore peace in Formosa
                            area which it is.<note n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">Telegram 579 to Moscow,

                        <p>The most important objective of our nation’s foreign policy is to
                            safeguard the security of the United States by establishing and
                            preserving a just and honorable peace. In the Western Pacific, a
                            situation is developing in the Formosa Straits, that seriously imperils
                            the peace and our security.</p>
                        <p>Since the end of Japanese hostilities in 1945, Formosa and the Pescadores
                            have been in the friendly hands of our loyal ally, the Republic of
                            China. We have recognized that it was important that these islands
                            should remain in friendly hands. In unfriendly hands, Formosa and the
                            Pescadores would seriously dislocate the existing, even if unstable,
                            balance of moral, economic and military forces upon which the peace of
                            the Pacific depends. It would create a breach in the island chain of the
                            Western Pacific that constitutes, for the United States and other free
                            nations, the geographical backbone of their security structure in that
                            Ocean. In addition, this breach would interrupt <pb n="116"
                                xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>North-South communications between
                            other important elements of that barrier, and damage the economic life
                            of countries friendly to us.</p>
                        <p>The United States and the friendly Government of the Republic of China,
                            and indeed all the free nations, have a common interest that Formosa and
                            the Pescadores should not fall into the control of aggressive Communist
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Influenced by such considerations, our government was prompt, when the
                            Communists committed armed aggression in Korea in June 1950, to direct
                            our Seventh Fleet to defend Formosa from possible invasion from the
                            Communist mainland.</p>
                        <p>These considerations are still valid. The Seventh Fleet continues under
                            Presidential directive to carry out that defensive mission. We also
                            provide military and economic support to the Chinese Nationalist
                            Government and we cooperate in every proper and feasible way with that
                            Government in order to promote its security and stability. All of these
                            military and related activities will be continued.</p>
                        <p>In addition, there was signed last December a Mutual Defense Treaty
                            between this Government and the Republic of China covering Formosa and
                            the neighboring Pescadores. It is a treaty of purely defensive
                            character. That Treaty is now before the Senate of the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile Communist China has pursued a series of provocative political
                            and military actions, establishing a pattern of aggressive purpose. That
                            purpose, they proclaim, is the conquest of Formosa.</p>
                        <p>In September 1954 the Chinese Communists opened up heavy artillery fire
                            upon Quemoy island, one of the natural approaches to Formosa, which had
                            for several years been under the uncontested control of the Republic of
                            China. Then came air attacks of mounting intensity against other free
                            China islands, notably those in the vicinity of the Tachen group to the
                            north of Formosa. One small island (Ichiang) was seized last week by air
                            and amphibious operations after a gallant few fought bravely for days
                            against overwhelming odds. There have been recent heavy air attacks and
                            artillery fire against the main Tachen Islands themselves.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese Communists themselves assert that these attacks are a prelude
                            to the conquest of Formosa. For example, after the fall of Ichiang, the
                            Peiping Radio said that it showed a “determined will to fight for the
                            liberation of Taiwan (Formosa). Our people will use all their strength
                            to fulfill that task.”</p>
                        <p>Clearly, this existing and developing situation poses a serious danger to
                            the security of our country and of the entire Pacific area and indeed to
                            the peace of the world. We believe that the situation is one for
                            appropriate action of the United Nations under its charter, <pb n="117"
                                xml:id="pg_117" facs="0145"/>for the purpose of ending the present
                            hostilities in that area. We would welcome assumption of such
                            jurisdiction by that body.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile, the situation has become sufficiently critical to impel me,
                            without awaiting action by the United Nations, to ask the Congress to
                            participate now, by specific resolution, in measures designed to improve
                            the prospects for peace. These measures would contemplate the use of the
                            armed forces of the United States if necessary to assure the security of
                            Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>The actions that the United States must be ready to undertake are of
                            various kinds. For example, we must be ready to assist the Republic of
                            China to redeploy and consolidate its forces if it should so desire.
                            Some of these forces are scattered throughout the smaller offshore
                            islands as a result of historical rather than military reasons directly
                            related to defending Formosa. Because of the air situation in the area,
                            withdrawals for the purpose of redeployment of Chinese Nationalist
                            forces would be impractical without assistance of the armed forces of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, we must be alert to any concentration or employment of Chinese
                            Communist forces obviously undertaken to facilitate attack upon Formosa,
                            and be prepared to take appropriate military action.</p>
                        <p>I do not suggest that the United States enlarge its defensive obligations
                            beyond Formosa and the Pescadores as provided by the Treaty now awaiting
                            ratification. But unhappily, the danger of armed attack directed against
                            that area compels us to take into account closely related localities and
                            actions which, under current conditions, might determine the failure or
                            the success of such an attack. The authority that may be accorded by the
                            Congress would be used only in situations which are recognizable as
                            parts of, or definite preliminaries to, an attack against the main
                            positions of Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>Authority for some of the actions which might be required would be
                            inherent in the authority of the Commander-in-Chief. Until Congress can
                            act I would not hesitate, so far as my Constitutional powers extend, to
                            take whatever emergency action might be forced upon us in order to
                            protect the rights and security of the United States.</p>
                        <p>However, a suitable Congressional resolution would clearly and publicly
                            establish the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief to employ
                            the armed forces of this nation promptly and effectively for the
                            purposes indicated if in his judgment it became necessary. It would make
                            clear the unified and serious intentions of our Government, our Congress
                            and our people. Thus it will reduce the possibility that the Chinese
                            Communists, misjudging our firm purpose and national unity, might be
                            disposed to challenge the position <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118"
                                facs="0146"/>of the United States, and precipitate a major crisis
                            which even they would neither anticipate nor desire.</p>
                        <p>In the interest of peace, therefore, the United States must remove any
                            doubt regarding our readiness to fight, if necessary, to preserve the
                            vital stake of the free world in a free Formosa, and to engage in
                            whatever operations may be required to carry out that purpose.</p>
                        <p>To make this plain requires not only Presidential action but also
                            Congressional action. In a situation such as now confronts us, and under
                            modern conditions of warfare, it would not be prudent to await the
                            emergency before coming to the Congress. Then it might be too late.
                            Already the warning signals are flying.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the threatening aspects of the present situation, if
                            resolutely faced, may be temporary in character. Consequently, I
                            recommend that the Resolution expire as soon as the President is able to
                            report to the Congress that the peace and security of the area are
                            reasonably assured by international conditions, resulting from United
                            Nations action or otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Again I say that we would welcome action by the United Nations which
                            might, in fact, bring an end to the active hostilities in the area. This
                            critical situation has been created by the choice of the Chinese
                            Communists, not by us. Their offensive military intent has been flaunted
                            to the whole world by words and by deeds. Just as they created the
                            situation, so they can end it if they so choose.</p>
                        <p>What we are now seeking is primarily to clarify present policy and to
                            unite in its application. We are not establishing a new policy.
                            Consequently, my recommendations do not call for an increase in the
                            armed forces of the United States or any acceleration in military
                            procurement or levels of defense production. If any unforeseen emergency
                            arises requiring any change, I will communicate with the Congress. I
                            hope, however, that the effect of an appropriate Congressional
                            Resolution will be to calm the situation rather than to create further
                            conflict.</p>
                        <p>One final point. The action I request is, of course, no substitute for
                            the Treaty with the Republic of China which we have signed and which I
                            have transmitted to the Senate. Indeed, present circumstances make it
                            more than ever important that this basic agreement should be promptly
                            brought into force, as a solemn evidence of our determination to stand
                            fast in the agreed Treaty area and to thwart all attacks directed
                            against it. If delay should make us appear indecisive in this basic
                            respect, the pressures and dangers would surely mount.</p>
                        <p>Our purpose is peace. That cause will be served if, with your help, we
                            demonstrate our unity and our determination. In all that we do we shall
                            remain faithful to our obligations as a member of the United Nations to
                            be ready to settle our international disputes by <pb n="119"
                                xml:id="pg_119" facs="0147"/>peaceful means in such a manner that
                            international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered.</p>
                        <p>For the reasons outlined in this message, I respectfully request that the
                            Congress take appropriate action to carry out the recommendations
                            contained herein.<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">H.J. Res. 159 was

                        <p>A statement issued by Premier <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> on January 24 charged that the United States had
                            “stepped up its military operations to make war provocations” and had
                            been “engineering a conspiracy for a so-called cease-fire through the
                            United Nations, to intervene in the Chinese people’s liberation of
                            Taiwan.” Declaring that Taiwan was “an inalienable part of China’s
                            territory” and that neither the United Nations nor any foreign country
                            had the right to intervene in “the Chinese people’s liberation of
                            Taiwan”, he asserted that the cause of tension in the Taiwan area was
                            that the United States had “occupied Taiwan, shielded the traitorous
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique and
                            incessantly directed subversive activities and war threats against the
                            People’s Republic of China.” In conclusion, he declared that to
                            safeguard China’s security and peace in the Far East, “the Chinese
                            people must liberate Taiwan, and the United States must stop intervening
                            in China’s internal affairs and withdraw all its armed forces from
                            Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits.” For this statement, see <hi

                            indicating that the British would be happy to meet the Secretary’s

                                >UN</gloss> action. The Secretary replied that a long delay would be
                            unnecessary and thought that we could go ahead on Friday<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d36fn2">January 28.</note> if the papers were in shape. He
                            said that hearings in the two Senate Committees which were meeting in

                                Res. 28 on January 24 and 25 in executive session; Secretary

                            would probably be concluded today and a vote taken. Debate on the floor
                            of the Senate might take several more days. Once the joint resolution
                            was out of Committee, <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> developments
                            would not interrupt progress. However, there was a strong element in
                            Congress opposed to the cease-fire idea and the Chinese Nationalists
                            were strongly opposed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said their opposition
                            was excelled only by that of Peiping. He then referred to a telegram
                            just received from <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName>
                            (British Chargé in Peiping), expressing the view that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> exercise would do more harm than good and
                            suggesting the possibility that, without going to the Council, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> might be asked to explore
                            the situation. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had asked
                            that <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName>’s views be brought
                            to the Secretary’s attention.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that we were pretty strongly committed to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. The Chinese Nationalists were
                            against it as much as the Chinese Communists but the President was
                            committed and the Secretary himself had reinforced the commitment in
                            Committee hearings. The Secretary emphasized that we were confronted
                            with the <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0149"/>threat to peace in the
                            area and we were committed to get some form of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action. It might be possible, however, to wait a week or
                            so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said that as an
                            alternative to the New Zealand Resolution, the matter might be brought
                            into the Security Council, which would then suggest that <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> explore the situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary felt that this would arouse suspicions in this country that
                            there was some sort of a “deal” on, in view of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s mission to Peiping in
                            connection with the release of the imprisoned airmen. The Secretary had
                            the feeling that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> had
                            been a bit naive and had really not gotten anything at all but a mandate
                            from the Chinese Communists to tell us to be more reasonable. He said we
                            could not turn over this matter to <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> at the present stage.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> indicated that the
                            British Government does not exclude going ahead with operation <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>; if we were ready to proceed, the
                            British were ready. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            simply wanted to check on our reaction to <persName corresp="#p_TH1"
                                >Trevelyan</persName>’s suggestion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> felt it important, however, that we make definite
                            efforts to exercise restraint and to secure Chinese Communist attendance
                            at the Security Council discussions. The Secretary replied that as to
                            the latter we could not contribute but we had no desire to hinder
                            Chinese Communist attendance.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> felt the big question
                            was what action to take in the event the Chinese Communists failed to
                            come. Should we drag our feet or push the resolution through?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we would have to feel our way and see what the
                            situation was. We would not want to commit ourselves.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> agreed that we should
                            keep an open mind as to what action should be taken in such an
                            event.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we would not want to press action if it would
                            break up the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He recalled that Senator
                                <persName>Saltonstall</persName> had asked whether putting the
                            matter into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might not place too
                            great a burden on it. The Secretary said that if we adopted the theory
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> couldn’t do anything and
                            by-passed it, you couldn’t get support for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and it would never grow up to its responsibilities. Its
                            main value lay in its being a forum for world opinion where influence
                            was exerted on nations to conform to the standards of world opinion. The
                            Secretary said that we were committed to take this matter up in the
                            United Nations and if we couldn’t agree on it the U.S. would have to
                            take action there itself. He had said in Committee hearings that the
                            U.S. would not necessarily take the initiative, but would if a third
                            country did not. The Secretary said that he assumed the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was with us on this question.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was with us but wished to take into
                            account the <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            statement.</p>
                        <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0150"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he thought <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s statement was stupid and would help get the
                            resolution through.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> then asked if we
                            should not go ahead on Friday.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed it was the consensus that the New Zealand letter
                            should be sent to the Secretary General on Friday and the first meeting
                            of the Security Council be held on Monday. This would be the last day
                            which Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> would
                            preside over the Council.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> indicated that it was
                            his understanding that there were no commitments as to what action
                            should be taken in certain events, such as the failure of the Chinese
                            Communists to come to the Security Council. The Secretary affirmed that
                            we did not wish to be committed.</p>

                        <p>At my briefing conference this afternoon, I asked the President whether
                            he had devised a mechanism to keep close watch on the implementation of
                            the new Formosa policy (approved at Jan 21/55 <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> Meeting) in the event that there should ensue a
                            deterioration into active hostilities.</p>
                        <p>I referred to past differences of views among the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> as to our China policy; to the broad language of our
                            new policy statement and his Message to Congress; to the possibility
                            that in the heat of action and counteraction of hostilities there might
                            arise a choice as to just what his real objective was: to end the
                            current hostilities or to deal a decisive blow to Red China.</p>
                        <p>He seemed interested in the point which I made, and discussed it for 4 or
                            5 minutes. He indicated very clearly (1) that if the going got tough, he
                            would expect daily reports from <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> or his representative, and (2) that he preferred
                            to act through the Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>,
                            rather than through the several Chiefs, in order to centralize
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>(It might be a good idea, under existing circumstances, to ask <persName

                        <p>391. Re Formosa. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName>
                            (China) called at his request this afternoon to seek information from me
                            about the ceasefire action, which I was unable to give him.</p>
                        <p>He said he had talked with <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName>
                            and had asked him whether <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName>
                            favored a resolution which would embody the idea of an appeal, or would
                            use the legalistic phrase “calls upon”. <persName corresp="#p_MSL1"
                                >Munro</persName> said he favored the phrase “calls upon”, and said
                            he hoped that during the debate in the Security Council <persName
                                corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> would “not make unnecessary
                            trouble”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> said: “I cannot remain
                            silent on these issues without being regarded as a traitor by my own
                            people. If the resolution uses the phrase ‘calls upon, I must be
                            stiffer. If the word ‘appeal’ is used, I can be softer. The words ‘calls
                            upon’ put me on the spot. I also prefer a vague phraseology such as:
                            ‘appeals to all the parties concerned’ rather than mentioning
                            Nationalist China and Communist China by name. If the latter happens,
                            then the concept of two Chinas is created and this is strongly to be
                            avoided”.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName> that I thought he
                            would make a great mistake if he vetoed such a resolution and that it
                            would be much cleverer from his own viewpoint to let the Soviet Union
                            veto it on behalf of the Chinese Communists. I said that if the Soviets
                            vetoed it and the Chinese Nationalists did not, this would give Chinese
                            Nationalist prestige a shot in the arm in the United States and would
                            create considerable new sympathy for Nationalist China, which would look
                            like the aggrieved peace-loving party. If on the other hand, the Chinese
                            Nationalists were to veto the resolution, it would make them look
                            belligerent and obstructive and would cost them friends here in America.
                            He said this was a consideration which he would carefully think
                            over.</p>
                        <p>My present impression is that he will make a speech, the stiffness of
                            which depends upon the phraseology of the resolution, but that he will
                            not veto.</p>
                        <p>I feel that use of “appeals” rather than “calls upon” is too weak and
                            that the Security Council should not appear to be “appealing” to the
                            Communist Chinese. <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">Tsiang</persName>’s
                            preference for “all the parties concerned” on the other hand seems to me
                            desirable.</p>

                                    The Special Assistant would therefore begin paragraph 1 with the
                                    following sentence: “The Chinese Communists, imbued with the
                                    suspicions that historically have characterized aggressors, will
                                    almost certainly view this action as further evidence of US
                                    hostility and aggressive intent against Communist China.”
                                    [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Simultaneously, the
                                Communists will probably attempt to portray any Nationalist
                                evacuation as a Communist victory, a demonstration of Nationalist
                                weakness, and as evidence of the futility of US support. These
                                propaganda themes will probably be reflected in Communist propaganda
                                worldwide.</item>

                                    Communists will continue probing actions against major offshore

                                    that the US was determined to prevent the seizure of a
                                    particular island position even to the extent of attacking
                                    mainland targets or retaking any lost island positions, they
                                    would probably be deterred from attempting such seizure in the
                                    near future. However, they would probably continue probing and
                                    attempts to subvert the garrison. They would also continue
                                    efforts to discredit and isolate the US on the issue of the
                                    islands and on the over-all issue of Taiwan and the
                                        Pescadores.<note n="6" xml:id="d40fn6"><p>The Deputy
                                            Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, and the
                                            Director of Naval Intelligence, believe that this
                                            paragraph should read as follows: “The manner in which
                                            the posited US policy is being adopted, with full
                                            discussion in the Congress and prior Congressional
                                            acquiescence in the use of force in defending Taiwan,
                                            the Pescadores, and such offshore islands as were deemed
                                            necessary in the defense of Formosa, would seemingly
                                            remove from the minds of Communist leaders any doubts as
                                            to the consequences of aggression against these
                                            positions. Under these conditions, the Communists,
                                            although quickly seizing control of evacuated islands,
                                            would be unlikely to assault the positions remaining in
                                            Nationalist hands. They would almost certainly continue
                                            efforts to discredit and isolate the US on the over-all
                                            issue as well as concerning those off-shore islands
                                            remaining in Nationalist hands. Over a long period of
                                            time, and depending upon the resolution with which the
                                            posited US policy was maintained, they might be tempted
                                            to put US intentions to test. For the short term,
                                            however, the risk of war in the Far East would have been
                                            decreased, not increased.”</p>

                                            Army, believe that paragraph 3 should read as follows:
                                            “The Chinese Communists would probably not take action
                                            that they believed would lead to full-scale war with the
                                            US, but they would be unlikely to believe that the
                                            seizure of any offshore island, even if the US has
                                            indicated it would defend the island, would lead to
                                            full-scale war. They would probably not be deterred by
                                            fear of a purely local involvement. If, therefore, the
                                            Chinese Communists estimated that they had the
                                            capability quickly to overrun any of the offshore
                                            islands, they would probably attempt to use that
                                            capability. In any event, they would probably continue
                                            probing action and attempts to subvert the garrison.”

                            attitudes and sober approach to critical problems.</p>
                        <p>It is probably difficult for you, in your geographical position, to
                            understand how concerned this country is with the solidarity of the
                            Island Barrier in the Western Pacific. Moreover, we are convinced that
                            the psychological effect in the Far East of deserting our friends on
                            Formosa would risk a collapse of Asiatic resistance to the Communists.
                            Such possibilities cannot be lightly dismissed; in our view they are
                            almost as important, in the long term, to you as they are to us.</p>
                        <p>I am certain there is nothing to be gained in that situation by meekness
                            and weakness. God knows I have been working hard in the exploration of
                            every avenue that seems to lead toward the preservation and
                            strengthening of the peace. But I am positive that the free world is
                            surely building trouble for itself unless it is united in basic purpose,
                            is clear and emphatic in its declared determination to resist all
                            forceful Communist advance, and keeps itself ready to act on a moment’s
                            notice, if necessary.</p>

                            that the Soviet and Communist Chinese Governments be notified of the
                            proposed New Zealand initiative by the United Kingdom representatives in
                            Moscow and Peiping at the earliest possible time on January 28. He said
                            that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> had also
                            expressed the views that the invitation to the Chinese Communists to
                            attend the deliberations of the Security Council should be conveyed by
                            the Secretary-General, who should be given sufficient opportunity to
                            make a determined effort to secure their attendance, and that the
                            possibility should not be excluded at a later stage of the utilization
                            of some conciliation mechanism if this were deemed likely to contribute
                            to the attainment of our joint objectives.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> then said that he
                            understood that the Secretary had some comments to make on the Working
                            Party Report. The Secretary said that his first comment had to do with
                            the statement in paragraph 4 (c) that the United States representative
                            would “endorse” the suggestion that a Chinese Communist representative
                            be invited under rule 39.<note n="4" xml:id="d42fn4">Security Council
                                Rule 39 states that the Security Council “may invite members of the
                                Secretariat or other persons whom it considers competent for the
                                purpose to supply it with information or to give other assistance in
                                examining matters within its competence.”</note> He said that while
                            the United States could acquiesce in such a suggestion, it would be
                            difficult for us to give it our endorsement. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> replied that, although it
                            was probably not a vital point, he believed U.S. endorsement might make
                            a significant difference in the success or failure of our efforts to
                            secure Chinese Communist attendance. After some further discussion it
                            was agreed that the language should read that the United States
                            representative would “agree” to the invitation to the Chinese
                            Communists. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> asked
                            whether this meant that the United States would vote in favor of such an
                            invitation in the event a vote should be necessary. The Secretary
                            replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the question of instructing Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> to support the démarche of the
                            United Kingdom representative in Moscow, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WDW1"
                                >Wainhouse</persName> said that he had already explained to
                                <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName>
                            <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0159"/>why this would not in our view
                            be advisable. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName>
                            confirmed this and said that he quite understood our position.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraph 5 (a) of the Working Party Report, the
                            Secretary explained the reasons for our wishing to amend the language of
                            the last sentence in order to avoid having our hands tied in perpetuity.
                            He said that for this reason he had suggested that the last part of that
                            sentence should read as follows: “shall at all times be subject to
                            consultation among the three Governments and for a reasonable time shall
                            be subject to mutual agreement.” <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir
                                Robert</persName> said that he thought that change would be
                            acceptable, since it had never been the intention of his Government that
                            there should be an unlimited commitment.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the timing of the submission of the
                                resolution,<note n="5" xml:id="d42fn5"><p>The agreed draft
                                    resolution, attached as Annex B to the report of the tripartite

                                <p>“The Security Council</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">Having noted</hi> the occurrence of armed
                                    hostilities between the Peoples Republic of China and the

                                    of the mainland of China;</p>

                                    security;</p>

                                    China)</p></note> the Secretary said that it was his feeling
                            that the resolution should be submitted at the outset in order to
                            forestall the flood of speculation which would otherwise arise as to
                            exactly what we had in mind in this exercise. He said that since it was
                            not feasible to try to keep the nature of the resolution secret, he
                            believed it would be more clear-cut to make the text of it known from
                            the first. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said that
                            this was the most difficult of all the Secretary’s suggestions for his
                            Government to accept. He said that there were three possible purposes of
                            the exercise: (1) to rally support for the Chinese Nationalists; (2) to
                            generate cold-war propaganda; and (3) genuinely to attempt to bring
                            about a pacification of the area. He went on to say that, assuming (3)
                            to be our common objective, it would be most difficult, in the event we
                            should fail in this objective, to prevent the exercise from being
                            perverted to serve the other two purposes. He said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> was going into this
                            exercise in the hope of achieving pacification and thereby getting out
                            of the dilemma presented by the problem of the off-shore islands. He
                            said the first big hurdle in achieving this objective was to persuade
                            the Chinese Communists to attend, and that it was the United Kingdom
                            view that we should do everything possible to secure their attendance.
                            After referring <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>in passing to
                            the House of Commons debate on this subject, <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> expressed the view that,
                            since <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had emphatically
                            announced that he would not accept a cease-fire in the area, the prior
                            submission of a resolution calling for such a cease-fire would virtually
                            force the Chinese Communists to reject the invitation. The Secretary
                            said that, since the United Kingdom Government felt so strongly on this
                            point, he would withdraw his suggestion. He added, however, that it
                            would be most important to make the true nature of the exercise clear
                            from the beginning in order to avoid wide-ranging speculation on the
                            subject. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> expressed
                            agreement with this view and said that, although withholding the
                            resolution itself, we should all make it amply clear that the objective
                            of the exercise was confined to obtaining the termination of
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>After a brief discussion of the timing of the New Zealand initiative, in
                            connection with which consideration was given to the current Senate
                            debate and to the fact that New Zealand would relinquish the presidency

                        <p>[Here follows a summary of portions of the intelligence briefing by

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then said that he
                            wished to comment on an item . . . . The Council, he said, might be
                            aware of the fact that <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>, the
                            Prime Minister of Burma, had recently prepared a written proposal giving
                            qualified support of President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>’s recently announced policy with respect to
                            the Nationalist-held offshore islands. He had supported the idea of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action in this area, but had
                            qualified it by suggesting that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            action be entrusted to Asian members of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. When it had been completed, <persName corresp="#p_NU1"
                                >U Nu</persName>’s proposal was sent both to <persName

                            before the proposal was made public. The reaction of <persName

                                facs="0164"/>said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>,
                            was by way of being a “stonecrusher.” Details were missing, but in
                            effect <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> to mind his own business. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> had promptly withdrawn his
                            proposal. All this was an interesting indication of the relationship
                            between Burma and Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> indicated that there
                            had been little change in the situation respecting the offshore islands
                            since the last meeting of the National Security Council. There had been
                            indications of a certain amount of sea reconnaissance by the Chinese
                            Communists in the Tachen area. This was reminiscent of Chinese Communist
                            operations prior to their attack on Ichiang Island. On the other hand,
                            there was no evidence of any new preparations by the Chinese Communists
                            for an attack on the Quemoys. The situation regarding the Matsu group
                            was different. These islands could be attacked at any time without any
                            notable additional preparations by the Chinese Communists. Radio silence
                            recently had made it more difficult for us to ascertain, for example,
                            the concentrations of Chinese Communist aircraft in these areas. Such
                            radio silence could be the prelude to further Chinese Communist attacks
                            on the offshore islands, but this was not necessarily the case.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’
                            intelligence briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> to
                            indicate briefly to the Council significant U.S. military moves in the
                            Formosa area in recent days. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>, in the U.S.S. <hi
                                rend="italic">Helena</hi>, was still in Formosa making arrangements
                            for the possible evacuation of the Nationalist garrison on the Tachen
                            Islands. He had concentrated four aircraft carriers and twelve
                            destroyers at a point approximately 100 miles north of Formosa and 125
                            miles south of the Tachens. The aircraft carrier <hi rend="italic"
                                >Princeton</hi> was likely to join this concentration presently, to
                            make a total of five aircraft carriers. An additional U.S. cruiser was
                            also likely to join the task force. Logistic support vessels were
                            standing by, and forty-five F–86’s had already landed on Formosa.
                            Additional F–86’s expected at Formosa in the course of the present day
                            would bring the total number of these aircraft to seventy-five.</p>

                            in tone. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> agreed
                            with Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName>, and said
                            he was particularly inclined to question the accuracy of the view that
                            the Soviets would not initiate general war or actions risking general
                            war, in view of the Chinese Communist reaction toward the President’s
                            statement to the Congress respecting U.S. policy in the Formosa
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The President said he believed that the Soviets were undoubtedly doing
                            all they could to involve the United States in Asia and in a general war
                            with Communist China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> added that this was why he was so inclined to
                            doubt the validity of the last sentence in paragraph 4–c.</p>
                        <p>With considerable emphasis, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said he wished to point out to the Council that
                            he had been involved for many months <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138"
                                facs="0166"/>in all the major studies and plans which had been
                            formulated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Never, however, in all this
                            long time, had the Joint Chiefs of Staff planned a U.S. land offensive
                            on the mainland of Communist China. For the life of him, he could not
                            understand why, in the event of a general war between the United States
                            and Communist China, all the worst difficulties would not be on the
                            Chinese rather than on the U.S. side. The great problem of the Chinese
                            in such a war was to “get at us if we don’t choose to be got at.” The
                            only direction in which the Chinese Communists could mount an aggressive
                            offensive on land would be toward the south or in Korea. Accordingly,
                            the general theory that a war with Communist China would involve the
                            United States militarily to very great depths, was simply
                            incomprehensible to him.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that this
                            was all very well, but would Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> explain to him how, if we got into a war with
                            Communist China, you would end it. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that he failed to see how the Russians
                            could be anything else but losers if the United States got into a
                            general war with Communist China. The Chinese Communists would have very
                            little offensive capability against us which we could not counter with
                            the exercise of comparatively little military power. It would,
                            accordingly, be a mistake, really, for the Russians to try to involve
                            the U.S. in war with Communist China.</p>
                        <p>With regard to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s
                            view as to such a mistake by the Russians, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the Admiral’s analysis
                            did not take account adequately of the political advantages which the
                            Soviets might well gain in Europe if we should get into a war with
                            Communist China. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            quickly admitted that he was speaking from a military point of view and
                            had not taken these other factors into account. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> went on to enlarge on the very
                            great difficulties that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony
                                Eden</persName> was facing in the British Parliament in his efforts
                            to back up the new U.S. policy regarding the offshore islands, in the
                            face of the combined opposition of Messrs. Attlee<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d44fn7">Clement Attlee, Leader of the Opposition.</note> and
                                Bevan.<note n="8" xml:id="d44fn8">Aneurin Bevan, Member of
                                Parliament and a prominent member of the Labour Party.</note> This
                            showed, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>,
                            that the big danger resulting from a war between the U.S. and Communist
                            China was not to be found in the realm of military action, where he
                            agreed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s
                            analysis. The great danger of such a war was the possibility that it
                            would alienate the allies of the United States and might indeed block
                            all our best-laid plans for Western Europe.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> went on to say
                            that his own analysis of the situation induced him to believe that
                            Russia and China were bluffing, <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0167"
                            />and that we would succeed in calling their bluff if we proceeded along
                            the lines of the recent decision respecting the defense of Formosa and
                            certain of the offshore islands. The Russians are perfectly well aware
                            that operations of the kind that could occur in carrying out this new
                            policy might give rise to a situation in which the Russians themselves
                            could become involved in a general war. Since he believed that the
                            Russians did not wish to become so involved, he believed that they were
                            bluffing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he, on
                            the other hand, was inclined to look at the situation much as Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> did. While he approved
                            the recent move by the President regarding Formosa and the offshore
                            islands, we might presently find out in fact whether the Soviets and
                            Chinese were really bluffing. On the other side of the picture,
                            continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, if he
                            had the job of killing a rattlesnake he would try to cut off his head
                            rather than his rattles. There was another aspect of this cold war
                            situation, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>,
                            that also continually bothered him. He believed that in many of the
                            underdeveloped areas of the world the ordinary run of people were likely
                            to make more progress under a communist regime than under the
                            traditional types of dictatorships. This was a troublesome fact, but he
                            nevertheless believed that the common people of China were getting along
                            just as well under the present regime as ever they had under the war
                            lords of the old days.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the exchange between Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, the President said he himself doubted whether
                            the Russians would permit themselves at this time to become involved in
                            a general war. He also doubted if any such general war could be ended in
                            a week or ten days. Perhaps the Russians felt the same way as he did.
                            Nevertheless, if they continued apparently to egg on the Chinese
                            Communists, there must be some good reason for it.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that his
                            explanation as to why the Soviets were apparently egging on the Chinese
                            Communists was as follows: The Soviets may fear that if the Chinese
                            Communists permit themselves to be involved in friendlier relations with
                            the Western world, the Soviets may not be able to control the Chinese so
                            effectively. If this were so, the most desirable course of action for
                            the United States was to try to separate the Chinese and the
                            Russians.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> observed that
                            while it was true that the Russians had had ups and downs in their
                            policy toward Europe since 1945, they had made steady progress since
                            that year in their program to subjugate the Far East. The only way to
                            put an end to this steady progress and to secure peace and stability in
                            Asia, was to carry out faithfully the policy which the President had
                            announced to the Congress last week.</p>
                        <pb n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0168"/>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> expressed great
                            skepticism as to the likelihood that the Chinese Communists would make
                            serious attacks on Formosa or on the offshore islands which the United
                            States would assist in defending. If this proved to be the case, and
                            after a certain amount of noise the Chinese Communists subsided and took
                            to peaceful ways, this was the moment for the United States to try to
                            broaden our trade with Communist China and to explore other
                            possibilities of opening up contact with them designed to wean them away
                            from their alliance with the Soviets.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President, speaking of paragraph 4–c which had given rise to
                            this discussion, said that perhaps the concern of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff with this paragraph was that it was too confident in its
                            assumption that the Communist rulers would act like normal people.
                            Communists simply do not react normally. Accordingly, said the Vice
                            President, he was skeptical of the possibility of inducing evolutionary
                            change in the Soviet Union or in the satellites if we believed that the
                            strategy set forth in the present report would ever change the minds and
                            the hearts of the Communist rulers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that paragraph
                            4–c be deleted as not being necessary to the sense of the paper as a
                            whole.</p>

                                                >NSC</gloss> meeting to say that in his opinion he
                                            thought it was necessary for the President to put out a
                                            statement saying he had not delegated his authority and
                                            would not delegate it as far as ordering the United
                                            States troops anyplace in the Formosa area. Some
                                            Senators on the Hill and other people have expressed
                                            considerable concern that the forces which are moving
                                            into that area would be subject to the direction of

                                            Others like [Senator Wayne L.] Morse [of Oregon], with
                                            his talk of preventive war, were causing a great deal of
                                            disturbance in the minds of even those who were
                                            supporting our position. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                                            discussed the deployment of United States air and naval
                                            forces in the Formosa area. The President made it clear
                                            that these forces were designed purely for defensive
                                            purposes and that any decision to use United States
                                            forces other than in immediate self-defense or in direct
                                            defense of Formosa and the Pescadores would be a

                        <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Off-shore Island Situation</hi>. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that eventually a formal
                            Chinese Government announcement of withdrawal from the Tachen Islands
                            would have to be made. The Chinese Government would want this to be
                            timed with some reference to U.S. assistance as necessary in the defense
                            of Quemoy and Matsu, in order to offset the adverse effect of the Tachen
                            withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that the Secretary had
                            made it clear that the U.S. is not committed to make any public
                            announcement regarding Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> gave Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> a draft Chinese statement
                            about withdrawal from the Tachens. In order to cooperate in full, he
                            wanted the Secretary to see this proposed announcement and to state his
                            opinion regarding it. He said the entire proposal was predicated on the
                            assumption that the U.S. Government, after passage of the Joint
                            Resolution, would make some sort of statement indicating that Quemoy and
                            Matsu were considered essential to the protection of Formosa and the
                            Pescadores. The statement reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    Chinese Communists as evidence by their renewed attacks on the
                                    off shore islands since September 3, 1954, and by their recent
                                    seizure of Yikiangshan Island, the Chinese Government, after
                                    consultation with the United States Government, has decided to
                                    redeploy its garrison forces on the Tachen Islands with a view
                                    to consolidating its overall military position and to more
                                    effectively dealing with further attacks by the Communists.</p>

                                    our plan of redeployment. This friendly offer the Chinese
                                    Government has accepted.</p>
                                <p>“There has been close cooperation between our two countries in

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that the
                            Joint Resolution had encountered some delay in the Senate because of a
                            dispute within the ranks of the Democratic Party. Some Democratic
                            Senators, apparently influenced by the <gloss target="#t_ADA1"
                                >ADA</gloss> point of view, had introduced restrictive amendments.
                            They were arguing about the authorization for necessary action in the
                            “related area”. The amendments had all been defeated in the Committee
                            but they had resulted in a delay. Also it had been necessary to postpone
                            hearings on the Mutual Defense Treaty. It was felt that the resolution
                            must be passed first.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that the
                            Secretary would leave on Saturday the 29th for a week’s rest.<note n="2"

                            during that time.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his
                            Government felt that early ratification of the Mutual Defense Treaty was
                            very important. There was general apprehension in Formosa that recent
                            events, including the President’s Message and the Joint Resolution,
                            might tend to sidetrack the Treaty. He and the Foreign Minister had
                            assured the Chinese Government that all the leaders of the
                            Administration are earnestly supporting the Treaty and there was no
                            intention whatever to defer action on it unnecessarily.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> confirmed that this
                            view was absolutely correct. No serious opposition to the treaty was
                            anticipated. Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> had
                            confirmed that he expected no real trouble. The Secretary has been
                            pressing the matter with the Senate leaders at every opportunity. There
                            was no intention to postpone action. It could also be expected that the
                            Senate would pass the Joint Resolution by a large majority, and that the
                            amendments which have been offered would be defeated.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> reiterated that any
                            announcement about the Tachens must be coordinated with an announcement
                            that Quemoy and Matsu would be held.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that it
                            might be unwise to publicly mention two islands by name and apparently
                            exclude the rest of the area. This might water down the authorization to
                            carry out defense actions as necessary in the entire area. A public
                            announcement was very different from classified operational orders to
                            the armed forces. It might be that operational orders had already been
                            issued. He did not know whether detailed public announcement about our
                            defense intentions would fit in with the planned strategy.</p>
                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0173"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he wanted to
                            avoid any embarrassment or misunderstanding. He felt that the Chinese
                            Government must make a statement eventually. It was preferable to make
                            the statement after the President had specific power to act. He would
                            like to know if we would go along with Chinese Government mention of
                            Quemoy and Matsu which would associate us in some way with the defense
                            of those islands. Chinese action would have to be governed by the U.S.
                            position after the Resolution is passed. His thinking was all
                            preliminary and he wanted friendly confidential advice from the
                            Secretary and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> as to
                            how the problem should be handled. The evacuation must not be allowed to
                            bring despair and disenchantment to the Chinese forces and people.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed. He asked if
                            the President’s Message and the large favorable vote in the house on the
                            Resolution had not helped morale.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> answered affirmatively,
                            but said there was still some uneasiness about Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the Resolution
                            gives express authority for the defense of such islands of Quemoy and
                            Matsu and any other places considered important to the defense of
                            Formosa and the Pescadores. He did not know whether it would be
                            customary or expedient to make a public announcement about defense of
                            only a part of the “related area”.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> felt that some public
                            statement, or at least an official confidential communication as to the
                            U.S. intent regarding Quemoy and Matsu was needed.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the President
                            would have the power to conduct operations for the defense of Formosa as
                            necessary in the related area. This would include any and all islands in
                            that area. The Secretary had already informed the Foreign Minister that
                            in our view under present circumstances Quemoy and Matsu are important
                            to the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. He felt that the Secretary
                            would state this again if requested by the Foreign Minister to do so.
                            But the Resolution would cover the entire area and its coverage would
                            not be restricted. He did not know whether the President wanted to make
                            a rigid statement of his intentions in a situation which was unstable.
                            There was no question but that Congress understood the wide scope of the
                            authority that would be granted under the Resolution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> left the Conference
                            to attend another meeting in the Secretary’s office.</p>
                        <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Proposed Security Council Action</hi>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> explained in general terms
                            the proposed New Zealand course of action in the Security Council. He
                            stated that the New Zealand letter was to be introduced in the Security
                            Council on January 28 and presumably <pb n="146" xml:id="pg_146"
                                facs="0174"/>would be discussed on January 31. It was anticipated
                            that the Chinese Communists would be invited by the Security Council at
                            that time to appear before the Council. The question of when the
                            Resolution would be introduced by New Zealand had been left open. In
                            fact there was no firm understanding as to timing and tactics beyond the
                            debate on the New Zealand letter. There was a firm understanding that
                            the scope of the Resolution, if it should later be introduced, would not
                            be enlarged. Broadening amendments would be resisted by New Zealand, the
                            U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and the effort would be
                            strictly pinpointed at off-shore islands, with everything else
                            rigorously excluded. The Foreign Minister was given copies of the draft
                            New Zealand letter and Resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister said that in his view the Chinese Communists should
                            not be invited to appear before the Security Council. He felt that this
                            was unnecessary and would give them unnecessary and undesirable “de
                            facto status”. He felt that they should be invited only to submit their
                            views in writing. He felt that a written statement from them should
                            suffice. It would meet all the requirements of the Security Council and
                            would prevent the Chinese Communists from exploiting an opportunity to
                            appear at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>He also objected to the fact that the draft Resolution did not brand the
                            Chinese Communists as aggressors, and made no distinction as to
                            responsibility for the hostilities between the Chinese Communists and
                            the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>He said that the Resolution failed to fix responsibility for aggression
                            on the Chinese Communists, and did not make clear the fact that the
                            Chinese Government had only acted in self-defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> pointed out that
                            the resolution could not be expected to prejudge the case, and all this
                            could come out in the course of the debate.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> also made the following
                            objections to the Resolution: <list>

                                <item>He did not like the term “peaceful settlement”. Its
                                    implications were too broad and it seemed to contemplate overall
                                    negotiations with the Chinese Communists.</item>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he hoped the U.S.
                            representative would make it clear in the course of the debate that the
                            U.S. will continue to oppose the admission of Communist China to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and to repudiate the “two-China

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> said that of
                            course this was U.S. policy and it could be stated on any appropriate
                            occasion. It could be stated where it was relevant.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> felt a Resolution
                            should be confined to a general appeal for peace and a cessation of
                            hostilities without naming the Chinese Government. There was no reason
                            for referring to an overall peaceful settlement, which was a broader
                            issue of the sort which was to be excluded from the Resolution.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister indicated that he did not like the Resolution, but
                            did not say what position the Chinese delegate would take. He intimated
                            that the Chinese delegate, <persName corresp="#p_TTF1">T.F.
                                Tsiang</persName> would be in touch with New Zealand Ambassador

                            subject.</p>
                        <p>Near the end of the interview the Foreign Minister apparently realized
                            for the first time that the Resolution might be used to protect the
                            Chinese Government position on the Tachen Islands or at least delay
                            evacuation of the islands. This thought seemed to moderate somewhat his
                            basic opposition to the proposed Resolution.</p>

                            we have no contacts with Chinese Communist Embassy here. They are in
                            part based on Soviet press treatment of issue which has been covered in
                            press telegrams from here and in part on deductions from general Soviet
                            policy at present time.</p>

                            <item>Soviet Government has no inclination to become involved in
                                hostilities over an area which does not involve a Soviet vital
                                interest such as Formosa. However, because of special relationship
                                and importance of China to Soviet Union in general world picture,
                                they would be confronted with a terrible dilemma in event of
                                outbreak real hostilities between US and China. Confronted with a
                                choice between involvement in a war in which they had no direct

                                influence is problematical. In last analysis, if issue was war or
                                peace, presumably Soviets would have important if not decisive
                                voice, but only in event that issue was completely clear.</item>

                                correspondent a few days ago submitted to censor speculative piece
                                in which it was stated that despite Soviet press support of
                                legitimacy Chinese aspirations to liberate Formosa, most foreign
                                observers believe Soviet Union would not be disposed to engage in
                                hostilities over area not vital to Soviet Union which Formosa was
                                not and that any conflict between US and China would be “Chinese
                                affair”. Story was held up for 12 hours indicating that it was
                                referred to higher authority and eventually passed with deletion
                                only of line referring to Soviet press support of Chinese position.
                                This, of course, is not conclusive but is very much in line with
                                extreme caution of Soviet press on Formosa question which, while
                                justifying morally Chinese position and quoting approval Chinese
                                statements on subject, has been careful not to commit even

                            to have had this off-the-cuff report on the Peking talks on the table,
                            although the limited time at our disposal made it impossible to analyze
                            what had been said in such detail as it seems to merit. I regret
                            especially that time did not suffice for an exchange of views of my
                            ideas concerning the next steps or for a discussion of our relationship
                            in this matter as a basis for the necessary co-operation in the

                        <p>The weakness represented by the fact that we have not had such a
                            discussion has become increasingly apparent to me in the week that has
                            passed since our talk. I would, in all frankness, like to explain to you
                            this reaction.</p>
                        <p>In view of the possible essential link which exists between the release
                            of the prisoners and the visit of the families, I feel that we went very
                            far in risk-taking by handling the visit question in the way we did up
                            to last Friday.<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">January 21.</note> From
                            another point of view it may be said that I, as Secretary-General, was
                            balancing on the outer margin of the permissible in trying to make the
                            issue more manageable for you. At the time of publication it was
                            essential to put the responsibility for the offer squarely on the
                            shoulders of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, while at
                            the same time not giving any impression of double-crossing him. That I
                            think we achieved in two ways: by indicating clearly that our news

                                    >footnote 3, Document 14</ref>.</note> was only a confirmation

                            was most surprised to see that this handling of the matter—which I

                            objectives agreed upon in our talks—was criticized in terms of unusual
                            strength. On the other hand, I was concerned when I saw that comments

                            it had been nothing but a propaganda move. Finally—again to my concern—I
                            was informed yesterday that the United States Government does not intend

                        <p>Without now entering upon the substance, I must confess that I am worried
                            when, in this way, I see issues which may be vital to the further
                            negotiations, handled and settled without any consultation with the
                            negotiator himself. This operation is, under all the circumstances, most
                            difficult and delicate.</p>
                        <p>Due to questions raised by delegations other than yours, I Have been able
                            to follow from a distance the discussion concerning the Formosa problem,
                            especially as it relates to the United Nations. In view of my exposed
                            position in the negotiations concerning the fliers, I have preferred to
                            stand aside for the time being and have not myself put any questions to
                            the United States Mission or to any other government representatives. I
                            have, however, expressed the hope that if any action were taken, it
                            would not be given such a form as to turn the Security Council operation
                            into something which would widen the gulf between East and West as it
                            would do, for example, if a proposed solution were so phrased as to make
                            unavoidable a Soviet veto. I have also expressed the hope that if any
                            action were taken it would be such as to give some momentum to the
                            developments which may arise out of the prisoner talks in Peking. In
                            view of the vital importance of this whole issue to peace, and more
                            specifically to the United Nations efforts to achieve peace, I would,
                            under all the circumstances, have regarded it as natural if some contact
                            had been established with the Secretary-General. As matters now stand,
                            when the Secretary-General has a more direct impression of the Chinese
                            aspect of the problem than anybody else in the West, <pb n="151"
                                xml:id="pg_151" facs="0179"/>and, furthermore, is himself already in
                            a certain sense a party as he is negotiating with China at the request
                            of the General Assembly, this view is reinforced. It is obviously for
                            the Governments to decide how they will act, but it seems to me that
                            their decisions should take into account also such aspects of the
                            problem as, in this case, could have been represented by the
                            Secretary-General.</p>
                        <p>The two points I raise here serve to illustrate what I said in the
                            beginning: I regret that time last Wednesday did not suffice for mutual
                            exploration of lines of action. I hope that it will be possible to
                            engage in such an exploration and to work more closely together in the
                            future. Else I, as Secretary-General, will find it very difficult to
                            serve the member nations in the way which would be possible on a basis
                            of continued and open contact on those issues where the
                            Secretary-General necessarily must have a special responsibility.</p>

                            from <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>. The President, in
                            most serious vein, has emphasized to civilian and military defense
                            leaders the gravity of the Formosan situation and stressed the fact that
                            events in that area have great significance with respect to delicate and
                            important diplomatic and political factors.</p>
                        <p>His objective is the averting of war and his publicly stated intent to
                            personally retain control of the initiation of combat operations, other
                            than self defense, is assurance to our countrymen and our friends
                            against impulsive action by field commanders. My confidence in your
                            sanity and judgement is such that I would not feel it necessary to
                            remind you of the fact that the significance of the Formosan situation
                            at this time is preponderantly political rather than military; however,
                            I want you to have the feel of the President’s leadership and his
                            thinking and I want to emphasize the importance of instilling in your
                            subordinates the restraint and understanding which will surely guide
                            them in the direction of the President’s policies.</p>
                        <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0180"/>
                        <p>There will also be great need for sound judgement in the event that we
                            cover an evacuation from the Tachens and in the further event that our
                            efforts are opposed by Red China forces. I consider that the pertinent
                            provisions of your OP plans are correct and consonant with the
                            President’s views and there is no minimizing of your duty to take
                            whatever action may be necessary for the security of your forces.
                            However, even though attack at source should be essential as a measure
                            of self defense, the political consequences of such action could be very
                            grave. Consequently, the decision to initiate such tactics must remain
                            firmly and solely in the hands of the OTC and your procedures for
                            tactical control and direction must be such as to insure against the
                            entrusting of discretion in this matter to tactical subordinates below
                            the OTC. The existing instructions concerning hot pursuit are not
                            modified by this guidance.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said it seemed
                            necessary to make some announcement about the Tachens very soon. The
                            Communists had started emplacing long range artillery on Ichiang Island
                            (Yikiangshan) which they had recently captured. They could shell the
                            Tachens from there. He realized that the situation for the U.S.
                            Government was delicate, with debate in the Senate on the Joint
                            Resolution still in progress. The Chinese Government did not want to
                            embarrass the Administration. Still he felt he should warn us that the
                            Tachen situation was becoming more precarious.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had to consider the effect of any public
                            announcement on the ratification of the Mutual Defense Treaty, as well
                            as on the Joint Resolution.</p>

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he envisaged the
                            following sequence of events: (1) the “regrouping” operation; (2)
                            ratification of the Treaty; (3) mutual consultations under the
                            Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this Government does not now contemplate
                            mentioning Quemoy and Matsu by name in a public statement. He thought it
                            would be preferable to adhere in general to the language of the
                            Resolution and refer perhaps to positions “related to the defense of
                            Formosa”. The Secretary mentioned that the Chinese statement should not
                            imply that the Treaty is already an accomplished fact. It should be
                            remembered that it is not yet ratified.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary thought that the Chinese should be cautious about making
                            any assumptions about the Treaty. The Treaty might not be passed for two
                            or three weeks. Committee hearings on the Treaty would probably start
                            February 7. There might be an extended debate on the floor of the
                            Senate. The issues brought up in the debate on the Resolution might be
                            picked up and repeated in the course of floor debate on the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he assumed
                            that the Resolution will have been passed by the time any Chinese
                            statement is made. The Resolution could be used as a basis.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he wanted to bring
                            up a second matter: Could the Tachens not be denied to the Communists?
                            He thought we should consider whether the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> should not be asked to keep a civil administration
                            there, without complete demilitarization of the islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought this would be very tricky business. If such
                            a principle were accepted it might be argued that it should be applied
                            to Quemoy and Matsu also.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said he was thinking of
                            a Chinese civil administration under <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            protection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thought this too
                            would establish a bad precedent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we were trying hard to accomplish one thing and one
                            thing only through the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action—namely,
                            to induce the Chinese Communists to stop fighting. The effort was to get
                            the Chinese Communists to go back to the pre-September 1954 situation.
                            The off-shore islands situation had been generally quiescent for about 5
                            years, since the Chinese Communists had been repulsed by the
                            Nationalists when they assaulted Quemoy in October 1949. Any other
                            question as to the general area would simply get you in trouble,
                            possibly leading to arguments over <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            jurisdiction, which might prompt someone to raise a proposal for <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> trusteeship over Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said undoubtedly
                            that line of approach was full of dynamite. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action should call only for cease fire as to the
                            off-shore islands. If the Chinese Communists received such a call <pb
                                n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0182"/>before withdrawal from the
                            Tachens, the request presumably would cover the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said if a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution were
                            passed before the evacuation was completed, there might be some degree
                            of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> protection. It might then be
                            possible to retain the Tachens with a civil garrison. But he did not
                            think the Chinese Communists would accept any substantive <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction over the question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said it was standard
                            Chinese Communist tactics to launch a big offensive before an
                            anticipated negotiation. This had been done in Korea and in Indochina.
                            The U.S. has never thought the Chinese Communists would comply with a
                            cease-fire request as to the off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said nevertheless we felt the New Zealand initiative would
                            put the Communists on the spot and help the U.S. and Chinese positions.
                            The move was partly invented by the U.S., for this reason.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if we knew
                            anything about a rumored new <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            plan for relinquishing the off-shore islands to the Chinese Communists
                            and setting up a “two China” situation?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we knew nothing about any such plan.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thought this
                            newspaper report might have developed from a speech which Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> made before the House of Commons a
                            few days earlier.<note n="2" xml:id="d50fn2">Reference is apparently to

                        <p>The Secretary said that the British and others would be willing to turn
                            over the off-shore islands to the Chinese Communists. The Kefauver
                            substitute resolution<note n="3" xml:id="d50fn3">The substitute
                                resolution, introduced by Senator <persName>Estes

                                floor on January 28, recognized the President’s authority to employ
                                U.S. armed forces for the specific purpose of defending Formosa and
                                the Pescadores from armed attack but did not authorize the defense
                                of related positions and territories; for text, see <hi
                                    rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi> (84th Cong., 1st Sess.),
                                vol. 101, pt. 1, p. 981.</note> was based on the thesis that the
                            U.S. had an established interest only in Formosa and the Pescadores, and
                            this stemmed from the victory over Japan and the fact that Japan had not
                            transferred sovereignty over Formosa to any other country. Under this
                            thesis Presidential action should absolutely be limited to Formosa and
                            the Pescadores. The <gloss target="#t_ADA1">ADA</gloss> thesis and the
                            British official view ran along similar lines. This was not the view we
                            accepted. It had been agreed with the British and the New Zealanders
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action would not be based on
                            any agreement as to the status of the off-shore islands or the rights of
                            the contesting parties. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action
                            would simply put it to the Communists whether they are willing <pb
                                n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0183"/>to stop the fighting in the
                            off-shore islands and go back to the situation existing before the
                            shelling of Quemoy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he had a third
                            matter to raise:—the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease-fire
                            proposal. Pres. <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> felt it
                            was bad from a psychological warfare standpoint to withdraw from the
                            Tachens on the eve of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> move. It was
                            tantamount to agreeing to let the Communists have the Tachens. Would it
                            not be better to hang on until a cease-fire move could take effect or at
                            least be considered?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he did not think there would be any cease-fire. He
                            thought the issue would be kicked around in the Security Council for
                            quite a while, possibly with no decisive result. The Communists would
                            claim there was no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> jurisdiction. They
                            would keep up a fuss. He thought the Chinese should announce immediately
                            upon passage of the Joint Resolution that they were making a military
                            withdrawal from the Tachens. The Joint Resolution would constitute a
                            make-weight to throw in the scales on the favorable side. He said he
                            would not pay much attention to the likelihood of favorable <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action. He thought if the Chinese missed
                            a chance to offset the bad effect of the evacuation with the added
                            strength and determination which could be derived from the Joint
                            Resolution, they would have nothing later with which to counteract the
                            letdown of the evacuation.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if the President
                            or the Secretary plan to make a statement?</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> hoped a statement, if
                            made, would characterize the prospective redeployment of the troops on
                            the Tachens as a move to enhance the strength of the Formosa
                            defense.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought something along this line could be done. He
                            hoped that the Resolution would be passed tonight or tomorrow. It looked
                            as if the opposition was beginning to crumble. The President might make
                            a statement on Monday after signing the Resolution. The Secretary said
                            “We will bear your interests in mind.” He wanted the Chinese
                            representatives to remember that he thought it was a good idea “to get
                            out the bad news when you have good news to cover up with”. He suggested
                            that the Chinese Government not let the situation draft. He said we
                            wanted to throw some strength into the balance “when otherwise a bad
                            morale problem might exist”.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> thought the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution should contain some sort of
                            condemnation on the Chinese Communists. He remarked that if the Chinese
                            forces held the Tachens, the Chinese Communists would undoubtedly hit
                            them again, thus committing a new aggression.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he anticipated that a regrouping operation would take
                            about two weeks. He suggested that the regrouping be <pb n="156"
                                xml:id="pg_156" facs="0184"/>tied in with either the Joint
                            Resolution or the statement of the President. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> hoped that the President could
                            indicate that in view of the circumstances now prevailing, the U.S. has
                            decided to help the Chinese Government defend Quemoy and Matsu. “Would
                            the American Government do this, or would it remain mute?”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could not say. He thought the President might want
                            to let actions speak for themselves. There were some disturbing
                            developments mentioned by our intelligence, including a new Chinese
                            Communist artillery buildup on the Fukien coast near Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if there would be
                            any objection to a Chinese statement that a civil administration would
                            remain on the Tachens, and that Chinese military forces would be
                            withdrawn as a peaceful gesture?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary questioned whether the withdrawal should be put on this
                            basis. He thought it was better to put it on a basis of a regrouping for
                            tactical reasons. It was desirable not to let it seem that the Tachens
                            were voluntarily relinquished to the Chinese Communists. He thought it
                            might be well to leave a Chinese Nationalist civil administration there.
                            Then the Communists could only move in by force. They could not simply
                            take over by default.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said in that event
                            the Chinese Nationalists would not be renouncing their rights to the
                            Tachens. They would not abandon them, but would only regroup their
                            military forces.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said the Secretary
                            apparently wanted the Chinese to avoid naming Quemoy and Matsu. The
                            Secretary said, “in your formal statements, yes”. He said there was no
                            formal agreement or commitment between our Governments as to this area.
                            There was no agreement the Chinese Government could hold the U.S.
                            Government to. It is the present U.S. intention to assist in the defense
                            of those islands. But the Chinese Government should not through its
                            public statements get the U.S. in the position of apparently having made
                            a formal commitment. The U.S. Government might have to deny such an
                            implication. Unofficial Chinese quarters could speculate on this. The
                            entire record of the debates in Congress shows that the President has
                            very broad authority to use U.S. forces as he considers necessary in the
                            “related area”. This is a matter of public knowledge. But he felt there
                            should be no indication of mutual commitments to defend any specified
                            places in the area outside Formosa and the Pescadores in any official
                            statements, either U.S. or Chinese. The responsibilities which the U.S.
                            was assuming were voluntary and unilateral. The Secretary said he had
                            told Congress that he felt we could not draw an absolute geographic

                            of démarche here, but also its general purpose, to enlist Soviet support
                            in persuading Chinese Communists to accept Security Council

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary General</hi>: I have your
                            letter of January 27th.<note n="2" xml:id="d53fn2"><ref target="#d48"
                                    >Document 48</ref>.</note> It illustrates, I am afraid, the
                            difficulty of you and me trying to deal with these matters on a direct
                            personal basis. We were together for over one and one half hours. Yet
                            you feel the time was inadequate. Perhaps it was, in the sense that it
                            would have taken many hours to have covered the subject in detail. That
                            is why I have to do a measure of delegating to Ambassadors and
                            assistants.</p>
                        <p>I quite realize that China matters have many aspects, any one of which
                            might perhaps influence, for better or for worse, the fate of the
                            prisoners. However, I thought that the United Nations Assembly mandate
                            was to deal with it as a simple issue, namely—will the Chinese Communist
                            régime comply with the provisions of the Korean Armistice? Other issues
                            were, I thought, not to be tied into this prisoner matter.</p>
                        <p>You refer to a “possible essential link which exists between the release
                            of the prisoners and the visit of the families”. I do not recall that
                            this thought was communicated by you during our extended conversation.
                            On the contrary, I recall that you and I were somewhat puzzled as to how
                            to reconcile the invitation to the families with a readiness to release
                            the prisoners; for then, the arduous, hazardous and expensive trip would
                            be unnecessary.</p>
                        <p>In any event, you will have noted that we merely declined to issue
                            passports “for the time being”. That decision was reached in the
                            interest of peace and to avoid affording occasions for what might be
                            further provocations in a sensitive situation.</p>
                        <p>If you have reason to believe that the visit of the families will, in
                            fact, procure the release of the prisoners, and you feel satisfied that
                            the visits would not lead to provocative incidents, then we would be
                            glad to reconsider the matter.</p>
                        <p>Won’t you talk these matters over fully and frankly with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName>, who has the complete

                        <p>At the dinner with <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Makins</persName> I
                            brought him up to date on the China question. We discussed the
                            situation. He said that the United Kingdom was prepared to stand firmly
                            behind the United States in so far as related to Formosa and the
                            Pescadores. The area of possible difference was Quemoy and Matsu. There
                            we would have to hope that the United Nations cease-fire and lapse of
                            time might bring a solution. He recognized that it would be hard to
                            determine whether or not the Communist operations against these islands
                            were in reality part of an attack designed against Formosa and the
                            Pescadores. We discussed possible motivation back of the Chinese
                            Communists and the Russians. He felt, and I agreed, that we might have
                            to review our basic assumption that neither of them wanted general war
                            at this time.</p>

                        <p>496. President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> had brief
                            telegram re offshore islands from Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> in Washington which causing him
                            much concern. He is replying to <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> but asked me to send his views direct to Department
                            by most urgent means.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> had understood that
                            immediately after passage of resolution by Senate, statements would be
                            issued simultaneously by US and his government. Latter would announce
                            withdrawal from Tachens for strategic reasons and redeployment of forces
                            now there. US statement would announce intention to help in defense of
                            Kinmen and Matsu, making our position clear to all concerned and
                            offsetting, in part at least, unfortunate psychological effect of Tachen
                            evacuation. Now President learns US statement, if any, making no
                            specific reference to Kinmen and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>He regards this new development as most dangerous particularly in light
                            of recent statements by <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> as well as impending
                            cease-fire discussions. President is convinced Soviet purpose is to
                            sabotage new mutual security pact while that of British is to sabotage
                            any extension of US support for offshore islands. He assumes Soviets are
                            putting pressure on British and latter are pressuring us along these
                            lines. <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> is highly
                            appreciative of President’s actions in present case and of overwhelming
                            approval by Congress. He fears any delay or indications of hesitancy at
                            this time would spoil strong effect of our recent actions and perhaps
                            encourage immediate Communist attack on islands. President regards next
                            two or three days as of greatest importance in this respect, after which
                            cease-fire discussions will generate atmosphere of appeasement
                            benefitting only the Communists.</p>
                        <p>I promised send telegram immediately but expressed hope President’s fears
                            not justified. Said I had no information re text of proposed US
                            statement but thought it possible our intentions toward Kinmen and Matsu
                            might be made clear without mentioning them by name; also this might
                            have advantage of not implying all other islands being written off.</p>

                            draft of proposed Chinese statement referring to China’s “negotiating”

                            important than success or failure. During conversation he emphasized

                            sincerity. He said Tachen and forces there might be lost, that Formosa
                            where he and his people were prepared to die might also be lost, but
                            that if China’s honor were preserved for posterity it would be
                            worthwhile. He had never gone back on his word to United States and
                            never would. He assumed United States to be guided by like
                            principles.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> went on to say he presumed
                            US regarded present developments in this area as important, that we were
                            aware of extent of China’s warlike preparations and of our
                            responsibilities in tipping scales for war or peace. Any sign of
                            indecision or weakness on our part would make war more certain and
                            responsibility for precipitating would be ours. He assumed also that in
                            relation with his government US realized it was not dealing with
                            children.</p>

                            misunderstanding may be a legitimate one growing out of the change in
                            the United States position as expressed to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> by the Secretary in their
                            meetings of the 19th and 20th [<hi rend="italic">21st</hi>].<note n="8"

                                    target="#d28">28</ref>.</note> There was considerable discussion
                            as to the real meaning behind the Secretary’s decision not to publicly
                            announce that we would support the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s against any attack on Quemoy or Matsu.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            received a call from Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> in New York. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> stated that he had just received a telegram from
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> which emphasized more strongly than
                            before <persName>Chiang</persName>’s concern over our seeming reversal
                            in the commitment to announce publicly that we would help defend Quemoy
                            and Matsu. Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> had suggested to us that <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            go ahead with his formal request for our assistance in the withdrawal
                            from the Tachens and include a request for our public commitment to
                            defend Quemoy and Matsu. It was <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName>’s idea that in our reply we could clarify our
                            reasons for not making public this commitment. After some discussion it
                            was generally agreed that this was not a sound course to take and that
                            it would be best to come to grips and solve this problem without having
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> and ourselves on record as in
                            disagreement.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            we had in effect already announced our intention to support the Tachen
                            withdrawal if requested. After discussion it was generally agreed that
                            an announcement that we were beginning our support of the evacuation of
                            the Tachens should be made but that this must await the receipt of a
                            formal request from <persName>Chiang</persName> and Presidential
                            approval of the request before it could be made.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>,
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that
                            there were a number of <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> ships
                            now available for the evacuation, as well as two or three United States
                            transports in the general area. It <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171"
                                facs="0199"/>was his belief that once the order for evacuation was
                            given it would take approximately twenty-four hours for the evacuation
                            ships to approach the Tachens and it was at this time that our
                            responsibilities for cover and support would begin. He felt that if
                            there were no <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> interference the
                            evacuation could be completed in ten to fifteen days. There were many
                            variables in this situation though, concerning the number of civilians
                            to be evacuated, weather conditions, the attitude of the Tachen military
                            command, as well as the always present possibilities of <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> interference.</p>
                        <p>After some further discussion of the technicalities of our decision to
                            support the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s against any
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> invasion of Quemoy and
                            Matsu, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> summed up the
                            opinions as follows:</p>
                        <p>That we were willing to support the defense of Quemoy and Matsu against a
                            real invasion attempt but that this is a unilateral decision on our part
                            pending appropriate action by the United Nations and subject to change
                            under conditions which may exist in the future.</p>
                        <p>The important point being that this was not a mutual agreement between
                            the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s and ourselves but a
                            unilateral decision on our part. We were willing to state this privately
                            to <persName>Chiang</persName> but we were not willing to make a public
                            statement to this effect. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> felt that we could and should have Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> clarify this point
                            with <persName>Chiang</persName> and that the formal request for aid in
                            the Tachen evacuation must await this understanding.</p>

                                    effectively dealing with further attacks by the Communists. This
                                    step to be carried out for strategic reasons does not affect the
                                    civil administration on these islands, which will continue to
                                    carry out its duties and functions as heretofore under the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> opened by explaining to
                            the President that he wished to bring him up to date on the situation
                            with respect to the offshore islands and to review the understandings
                            and commitments we had reached with <persName>Chiang</persName> and the
                            British with respect to both our <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"
                            />actions regarding the offshore islands and the action in the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>The President said that the world press and world opinion clearly
                            differentiated between Formosa and the Pescadores on the one hand and
                            the offshore islands on the other. Similarly, in the hearings before
                            Congress there had been a differentiation between the two, and the
                            Resolution had been based on the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores,
                            it being made clear that the U.S. would decide itself what related
                            positions might be essential to the defense of Formosa in the light of
                            the circumstances obtaining.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> gave the President the
                            Secretary’s testimony as set forth on page 72.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d63fn2">Reference is apparently to the Secretary’s testimony
                                at the joint hearing held by the Senate Committee on Foreign
                                Relations and the Committee on Armed Services (see <ref
                                    target="#d36fn3">footnote 3, Document 36</ref>). The document
                                under reference, apparently an unpublished transcript, has not been
                                found in Department of State files.</note> The President said this
                            expressed it very clearly. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> then read to the President extracts from the
                            Secretary’s original opening statement to the Joint Committee. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> observed that the
                            Secretary’s subsequent statements in reply to questions modified the
                            interpretation which might be placed on his original statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> explained our
                            commitment to the British that we would make no public statement
                            concerning our present intention to defend Quemoy and Matsu in return
                            for which they would support “<hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>”. At the
                            same time, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> explained
                            we had told the British that we must be free to let the Chinese
                            Nationalists know of our present intention to assist in the defense of
                            Quemoy and Matsu if this were necessary.</p>
                        <p>The President intervened to say that Britain then does not expect us to
                            say we won’t defend Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> confirmed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> understands that
                            our present intent is to assist in the defense of these islands as
                            essential to the defense of Formosa, but that we will not make any
                            public statement to this effect since in the British view this would
                            nullify any prospect of successful action on the New Zealand <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Resolution calling for a ceasefire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> explained that we had a
                            message from <persName>Chiang</persName> indicating that he believed we
                            had committed ourselves to make a public statement that we would defend
                            Quemoy and Matsu at the same time the evacuation of the Tachens was
                            announced. This message indicated that <persName>Chiang</persName> would
                            not request our assistance in the evacuation of the Tachens until our
                            position regarding Quemoy and Matsu had been clarified. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained in some detail the
                            position the Secretary had taken with <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >George Yeh</persName> in the various meetings <pb n="175"
                                xml:id="pg_175" facs="0203"/>with him, and stressed the
                            psychological importance of how this question was handled in terms of
                            its impact on the Chinese Nationalist morale and will to resist.</p>
                        <p>The President said we could not make a public statement specifying we
                            would defend Quemoy and Matsu. While originally he recalled we had
                            contemplated such a statement, we had changed our view on this as a
                            result of further consideration. Furthermore, we should not be committed
                            to hold these offshore islands since such a commitment could be
                            construed as of indefinite duration and we should not tie ourselves down
                            in what was only one incident of the great over-all struggle of freedom
                            against Communist expansion. He went on to say that <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> and what we are trying to do in
                            Europe is vital to our security and we must bear this constantly in mind
                            in what we do in the Formosa area. The President said: “Our purpose in
                            defending these areas is to defend Formosa and the Pescadores if they
                            are threatened. It is not a permanent commitment to defend any of these
                            offshore islands.” For example, the President was not certain that the
                            Matsu group were as important to the defense of Formosa as Quemoy. If
                            the present Chinese regime consolidated its power, the offshore islands
                            might eventually fall under their control while Formosa and the
                            Pescadores remained in the hands of the Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>The President thought we could draft a friendly message to reassure
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> along the lines that we were pushing
                            hard for the ratification of the Treaty, and that pending the results of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action on the off-shore islands we
                            would examine and keep in touch with <persName>Chiang</persName> on all
                            related areas under <persName>Chiang</persName>’s control so the US can
                            assist in their defense if we believe that a situation has arisen
                            threatening Formosa and the Pescadores. In other words, we will examine
                            the situation continuously and keep under constant study all actions in
                            the areas held by the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s and be
                            in constant touch with him so as to see how we can assist in steps
                            deemed by us necessary in the defense of Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The President said we must be sure we are not hooked into any agreement
                            whereby we would have to join in the defense of Quemoy or Matsu just
                            because they were attacked, by a battalion for example. He explained
                            that the Chinese Communists could throw a relatively small attack
                            against the islands which the Chinese Nationalists could repulse. The US
                            should not be obliged to get into a war with Communist China on this
                            basis. He said: “We must be the judge of the military situation that
                            draws us in whether in Quemoy or elsewhere.” The President said that
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> must know we
                            aren’t going to intervene in the defense of Quemoy or Matsu just because
                            they are attacked, for example by a battalion or so. The President said
                            he did not believe he had met Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Stump</persName>, but understood he was a good man. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> confirmed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> was one <pb n="176"
                                xml:id="pg_176" facs="0204"/>of our ablest naval officers. The

                            the problem was, and it was going to be necessary, but it would be
                            difficult, to get this all across in orders to Admiral <persName

                            >Robertson</persName>. The President said that it seemed all right.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> said there was
                            thought that the President might send a message to the President of the
                            Security Council of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, when we had
                            reached agreement with the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s,
                            announcing we were assisting in the evacuation of the Tachens.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> thought this
                            would be a good idea. The President agreed that this sounded useful and
                            was worth considering. He said that in any such message it might be
                            possible in some way to imply that the Tachens were being evacuated
                            because they were off to the flank, and not essential to the defense of
                            Formosa, but that other islands (Quemoy and Matsu, without mentioning
                            them) were in a different category.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> said that with
                            the New Zealand Resolution coming up in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> tomorrow it would be helpful if no statement were made
                            for two or three days.</p>
                        <p>The President concurred and said we would have to drag things on for at
                            least a couple of days because we would have to send a message to
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, receive his reply, and reach agreement,
                            etc.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            would have a message drafted to send to <persName>Chiang</persName>

                            <item>With regard to sub-paragraph (d). I recall this discussion and
                                believe that my explanation may have been misunderstood. It is my
                                feeling that the Officer in Tactical Command—the flag officer on the
                                scene—must have discretion in deciding when his forces are in such
                                jeopardy that he is justified in attacking the air bases from which
                                the attackers come. The <hi rend="italic">initial</hi> attack may be
                                in considerable strength—that is an option the Communist commander
                                will have. The initial attack might be directed primarily against
                                U.S. forces and <hi rend="italic">might</hi> cause such damage to
                                our own evacuating forces that the U.S. commander would feel that to
                                prevent further damage he had to order an attack on Communist
                                airfields. Certainly there would be no time to communicate with

                            accept invitation to attend. Indeed, one purpose of Soviet resolution

                            internal affair. It is by no means clear, however, that Chinese

                            seems to reflect dual motive Soviet’s policy in regard to Formosa

                        <p>I consider that there has been given the British a firm commitment that
                            the United States will make no public statement concerning its
                            intentions with respect to Quemoy and the Matsu Islands until the
                            results of the action in the Security Council are known, and that it was
                            upon the basis of receiving this commitment that the <pb n="180"
                                xml:id="pg_180" facs="0208"/>British agreed to support immediate
                            action in the Security Council on Operation <hi rend="smallcaps"

                        <p>In <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger Makins</persName>’ letter of
                            January 21 on this subject addressed to the Secretary of State<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d67fn2">See <ref target="#d27fn3">footnote 3, Document
                                    27</ref>.</note> the commitment that they desired from us is
                            stated somewhat differently. The second paragraph of the letter reads:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The position of Her Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom
                                    is that they are ready (subject to New Zealand agreement) to
                                    support immediate action in the Security Council on lines
                                    already agreed, if the United States Government is prepared to
                                    withhold any promise of help in the defense of Quemoy Until the
                                    results of the action in the Security Council are known.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>I believe that this formulation of the commitment was modified and
                            implicitly accepted by the British Government in the modified form. On
                            January 20 the Secretary had stated to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName><note n="3" xml:id="d67fn3">See <ref target="#d25"
                                    >Document 25</ref>.</note> that it might be possible to be less
                            specific than then planned in our public statement but that it was
                            necessary to make clear to the Nationalists our intentions regarding
                            Quemoy. Our intentions were described by the Secretary in that
                            conversation as being under present conditions to assist the Chinese
                            Nationalists in the defense of Quemoy because it is important to the
                            defense of Formosa and it remained the avowed purpose of the Communists
                            to take Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Against the background of this statement, the Secretary said to <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> on January 21 (at which
                            meeting the Ambassador’s letter referred to above was discussed) that at
                            the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting it was agreed that there
                            would be no statement publicly made regarding the intentions of the
                            United States with respect to Quemoy and the Matsu Islands, and, later
                            in the conversation, that he hoped the British Government would consider
                            that we had substantially met the points which they had raised and that
                            it would thereby be enabled promptly to support <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi>. At the conclusion of this discussion the British
                            Ambassador then said that in his personal opinion we had met in
                            substance the British position and that he would recommend to his
                            Government that we move ahead promptly on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi>. It must be assumed that <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1"
                                >Sir Roger</persName> accurately and in detail reported this
                            conversation to London. The following day the British did in fact move
                            ahead in conjunction with us on Operation <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I should add as my own judgment that the British Government, in agreeing
                            to move ahead on <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> without acceptance by
                            us of the commitment they sought in the terms they used, was relying on
                            its understanding derived from the series of conversations that the
                            purpose of the United States was to reduce the risk of war and to <pb

                            assuming unilateral responsibilities. (This was major objection to 1950
                            neutralization.) Would it be possible for Chinese statement, if and when
                            issued, to refer to joining in “protecting such related positions and
                            territories as the two governments agree to be essential to defense of

                        <p>Under present highly delicate circumstances I would recommend considering

                            disregarding far more significant favorable developments which showed
                            that the U.S. was very much in earnest in its intention to aid the
                            Chinese against further Communist aggression. It was unfortunate that in
                            the face of such impressive evidence, the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> should harbor suspicions that he had been
                            double crossed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            stressed the import of the overwhelmingly favorable vote in both Houses
                            of Congress on the Joint Resolution:—in the House, 400 [<hi
                                rend="italic">410</hi>] to 3; in the Senate 83 to 3. One of the
                            “nay” votes in the House was actually based on the argument that the
                            Resolution did not go far enough. The size of this enormous majority was
                            a political phenomenon which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said was absolutely unique in his experience.
                            It was a striking thing that partisanship between the parties, and
                            differences within the Democratic and Republican parties had been
                            completely submerged in the recording of this impressive vote. The
                            emphatic approval of this Resolution showed better than anything else
                            could the strong backing which the American people accord to free China
                            and the well nigh unanimous resolve to make a firm stand against further
                            Chinese Communist encroachment. This vote should give immense
                            encouragement to the Chinese Government. The positive significance of
                            the Resolution far outweighed the slightly negative impact of the U.S.
                            decision not to make a public commitment about the defense of Quemoy and
                            Matsu. That decision had been taken because of a conviction that it
                            would be wiser to adhere strictly to the language of the Joint
                            Resolution and not create questions as to whether we had deviated from
                            the spirit and intent of the Resolution by apparently singling out and
                            freezing the position as to two points, while seemingly disregarding the
                            rest of the “related area”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> paid a tribute to
                            the great qualities of the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> as a Chinese patriot and leader, and as a
                            stalwart foe of Communism. He said that he knew the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> well and considered him
                            to be one of the foremost figures of this generation. At the same time
                            he felt he could say without disrespect (and the Foreign Minister and
                            the Ambassador knew he would not show any disrespect for their
                            President), that the international view of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> was somewhat
                            circumscribed by the fact that he had never been outside of the Far East
                            and had no conception of the complexities of political and diplomatic
                            processes in the U.S. He thought that <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186"
                                facs="0214"/>in some respects the world view of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissmo</persName> was nearly as restricted
                            as that of a typical U.S. mid-westerner. This tended to make him at
                            times unduly suspicious of American motives. He was occasionally
                            inclined to ascribe double dealing intentions to the U.S. and to be
                            tempted to infer we might be ready to sell Free China down the river in
                            concert with the British.</p>
                        <p>There was no justification for these suspicions and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> hoped that the Foreign
                            Minister and the Ambassador could convince the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> that his misgivings were
                            groundless, and that recent developments in the crisis have been much to
                            the advantage of Free China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then read the
                            substance of the important message which had just been sent with the
                            approval of the President to the American Ambassador in Taipei for
                            delivery to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                            (Department’s 421).<note n="2" xml:id="d70fn2"><ref target="#d69"><hi
                                        rend="italic"><ref target="#d70"
                                >Supra</ref></hi></ref>.</note> The Foreign Minister and the
                            Ambassador listened carefully. The “statement” portion of the message
                            was reread by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName>
                            while a Chinese secretary (Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WP1"
                                >Wang</persName>) took it down word for word.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he felt the
                            message would serve to reassure the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> that there could be no question of the
                            U.S. welshing on the position set out, in view of the fact that it had
                            the express approval of the President of the U.S. The significance of
                            the top secret U.S. statement on Quemoy and Matsu would be fully
                            apparent to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>. It
                            would certainly hearten him and his Government. However, the Foreign
                            Minister felt that the message would not provide the public offset to
                            the bad news of the Tachen withdrawal, which the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> felt was urgently
                            required for public relations purposes, both in the Army and with the
                            civilian populace. The security restriction made it impossible to get
                            any public relations value out of the important U.S. decision. This was
                            the remaining difficulty. All of the Chinese Government decisions and
                            plans had been based on the assurances originally received from
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> the week before
                            last that a public announcement would be made of the U.S. intention to
                            assist in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu. The abrupt reversal of the
                            U.S. position left the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> in an awkward situation and had placed him
                            in a frame of mind which made him receptive to suspicions that the
                            British had persuaded the U.S. to back down, paving the way for an
                            eventual surrender of all the offshore islands in return for a Formosa
                            cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>The problem was to give the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> some tangible public evidence of U.S.
                            support to counteract the bad effect of the Tachen withdrawal.</p>
                        <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that the advice to
                            evacuate the Tachens had gone very hard with the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>. He was wedded to the
                            idea of holding the Tachens, into which a great deal of Chinese effort
                            and resources have been poured over a period of five years, seeking to
                            make the islands as nearly impregnable as possible. Both the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> and Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> felt that the Tachens
                            were important from a strategic point of view, since they gave ready
                            access to an important section of the China Coast and also lay across
                            sea and air routes from the Shanghai area to the Formosa Strait. He said
                            they would be very valuable in connection with any reconquest of the
                            Mainland. However, he admitted that under present conditions it was
                            practically impossible to supply and utilize the Tachens without air
                            control. We acknowledged that air superiority could hardly be achieved
                            with Chinese Government air bases four times as far away as Chinese
                            Communist air bases. He said the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> had been offended by a recent reference by
                            the Secretary to the Tachens as “only a bunch of rocks”.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d70fn3">Reference is apparently to a remark made by

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked that we
                            were not urging the Chinese to withdraw from the Tachens. But we did
                            feel that the Tachens did not have any real military importance and had
                            decided that we could not use our military forces to hold them. We had
                            offered to assist the Chinese, if asked, in effecting a withdrawal and
                            redeployment, but we were not insisting that the Chinese withdraw.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> referred to articles by
                            John Hightower of the <gloss target="#t_AP1">AP</gloss> and Walter
                            Lippman of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald-Tribune</hi> on January
                            31 intimating that the off-shore islands were being kept in reserve by
                            the U.S. as a possible pawn to be used in a general cease-fire deal with
                            the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphatically branded
                            these rumors as totally without foundation in fact, and as emanating
                            from persons who had no authorized knowledge whatever as to classified
                            policy decisions of the U.S. Government. He remarked that the Chinese
                            Government representatives should decide whether they would deal with
                            and have confidence in the President and the Secretary, or newspaper men
                            who were completely outside the policy councils, and who were writing
                            conjectural stories in ignorance of the actual decisions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he wanted the
                            Chinese representatives to know of the understanding and sympathy with
                            which the President regarded the cause of Free China. He remarked that
                            the President had said explicitly at the White House conference on the
                            night of January 30 immediately after he returned from Augusta and
                            before <pb n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>he had dinner, that he
                            wanted a warm and friendly message containing strong reassurances sent
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>. He did not
                            want to leave the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                            in any doubt as to the firmness of American support as most recently
                            demonstrated by the presence of the Seventh Fleet in the area, and the
                            stationing of a full Air Force wing of jet planes on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The President had felt that we should not take a public position which
                            departed from the language of the Joint Resolution. He did not want to
                            seem to freeze a formal public position covering part of the “related
                            area” which might seem in the circumstances to disregard the fluid
                            nature of the situation and ignore the remainder of the “related
                            area”.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that he felt
                            that we should seek a formula acceptable to the President and to
                            Congress, compatible with the language of the Joint Resolution, and
                            capable of meeting President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s need for a positive public declaration which
                            would make more understandable to his military commanders and soldiers
                            the unpleasant withdrawal decision. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> then proposed the following
                            formula which he felt all elements could accept: <quote

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> pointed out that
                            this language still left the decision to the U.S. It confirmed that
                            Quemoy and Matsu were included in “such related positions and
                            territories”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that the
                            Treaty hearings would begin on Wednesday, February 2, instead of Monday,
                            February 7. He said the hearings had been moved forward at the request
                            of the President in order to speed the ratification of the Treaty. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> cited this as
                            another evidence of the earnestness and singleness of U.S. purpose. He
                            mentioned that any official public statements regarding the Treaty area
                            or the “related area” might have an effect on the Treaty hearings.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that it might be
                            worth while to explore the possibility of effecting an exchange of notes
                            in regard to the defense of <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0217"
                            />Quemoy and Matsu. He was not proposing it but simply putting forward
                            the idea informally for examination.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the formal
                            inclusion of Quemoy and Matsu in the defense area would amount to an
                            extension of the Treaty area. He said there was no question in his mind
                            but that such an extension of the Treaty area would require Senate
                            ratification. Even if such an understanding were merely embodied in
                            notes, the documents would have to be sent up to the Senate as an
                            amendment of the Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that his
                            Government would prefer some sort of bilateral understanding concerning
                            the defense of Quemoy and Matsu, to a unilateral U.S. declaration.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> hoped the Chinese
                            representatives would impress on the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> that our position on the China issue was
                            very different from that of the British. The positions were widely
                            divergent. The <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> must
                            understand that our concurrence in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            effort to bring about a cessation of hostilities was strictly pinpointed
                            at the offshore islands and did not signify that we had succumbed in any
                            way to British influence.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Chinese did not have a better friend than the Secretary of State.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> grasped the
                            magnitude and the nature of the Communist threat with a clear and far
                            ranging vision. No one understood the needs of the present situation
                            better than he. He had a profound understanding of the imperative need
                            for the continued existence of Free China. He stood with the Chinese.
                            The leaders of the Chinese Government need to understand the difficult
                            U.S. political and diplomatic problems, curb their suspicions and
                            negotiate on a basis of full confidence.</p>

                            1955</hi></date>.</dateline>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Al</hi>: The past two weeks in Washington have
                            been a period of tension—reminiscent of the numerous “flaps” that used
                            to plague us in the old War Department.</p>
                        <p>The principal cause has been the Administration’s effort to clarify our
                            people’s understanding of the consequences of an attack by <pb n="190"
                                xml:id="pg_190" facs="0218"/>the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s on Formosa and its neighboring islands, and to
                            obtain their expressed support of the government’s plans to defend those
                            islands effectively. An added difficulty, as is always the case, has
                            been the extreme care with which the public relations angle of this
                            effort had to be handled.</p>
                        <p>In the present case, we have a Europe that, speaking generally, is
                            fearful of what some Europeans consider American recklessness,
                            impulsiveness and immaturity in the foreign field. In Red China we have
                            a dictatorial regime which seeks every opportunity to develop among its
                            own people and all other Asiatics a deeper and deeper hatred of the
                            West, particularly of the United States. In Formosa we have the remnants
                            of the Chinese Nationalists who are suspicious of any move in the Far
                            East that does not involve an “immediate direct and destructive attack
                            on Red China.”</p>
                        <p>At home we have the truculent and the timid, the jingoists and the
                            pacifists. Underlying the whole is the most important fact of today’s
                            life—the irreconcilable conflict between the theories of the Communist
                            dictatorship and the basic principles of free world existence.</p>
                        <p>Any military man can easily make clear distinction between the defense of
                            Formosa and the defense of the so-called offshore islands. Not only are
                            two different military problems presented, but in the one case we are
                            talking about territories the control of which has passed from nation to
                            nation through the years—and in the other case, about territories that
                            have always been a part of the Chinese mainland both politically and, in
                            effect, geographically. So the political differences are almost as plain
                            as the military differences when we talk about the defense of these two
                            territories.</p>
                        <p>If there were no other factors than the military to consider, you and I,
                            for example, would study the problem and would very quickly reach a
                            decision that we would permit <hi rend="italic">no</hi> advance by the
                            Communists beyond the offshore islands, but that in any struggle
                            involving only the territory of those islands, we would see no reason
                            for American intervention.</p>
                        <p>Such a solution would infuriate the Chinese Communists because of their
                            announced objective to take Formosa; it would infuriate the Chinese
                            Nationalists because the retention of the offshore islands sustains
                            their hope that one day they will go back to their homeland. It would
                            more or less please our European friends because it implies to them a
                            moderate attitude on our part, and the responsible officials in those
                            countries can see the danger to all of us if Formosa should fall to the
                            Communists. (Not that Red China, in her present state, would be a direct
                            threat to the United States, but with international Communism having
                            thus penetrated the island barrier in the Western Pacific and in a
                            position to threaten the Philippines <pb n="191" xml:id="pg_191"
                                facs="0219"/>and Indonesia immediately and directly, all of us would
                            soon be in far worse trouble than we are now.)</p>
                        <p>At home the hypothetical solution I mention would be accepted by most
                            merely because it is simple to describe, although there is a certain
                            pacifist element that wants us completely out of the Western Pacific.
                            Some people seem to think that we can surrender to the Communists the
                            Japanese productive capacity and all the richness of the South Pacific
                            territories and still be perfectly safe in this country. There are
                            people who did not believe Hitler’s threats any more than they now
                            believe those of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> and the
                            Kremlin.</p>
                        <p>Now, if the solution we adopt should state flatly that we would defend
                            the principal islands of the offshore group (Quemoy and the Matsus), we
                            would now please the Chinese Nationalists, but we would frighten Europe
                            and of course even further infuriate the Chinese Communists. Not that I
                            think this last particularly important, because they are going to be
                            infuriated anyway.</p>
                        <p>By announcing this as a policy we would be compelled to maintain in the
                            area, at great cost, forces that could <hi rend="italic">assure</hi> the
                            defense of islands that are almost within wading distance of the
                            mainland. This defensive problem could be extremely difficult over the
                            long term, and I think that the world in general, including some of our
                            friends, would believe us unreasonable and practically goading the
                            Chinese Communists into a fight. We could get badly tied down by any
                            such inflexible public attitude.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, as we consider the problem of defending Formosa, we
                            understand how important to us is the morale of the Chinese forces on
                            that island. Their willingness to fight and to keep themselves in a high
                            state of readiness for fighting is one of the keys to the situation.
                            Consequently, even though we clearly see that our major concern, <hi
                                rend="italic">so far as territory itself is involved, does not
                                extend beyond Formosa and the neighboring Pescadores</hi>, yet the
                            economical and efficient defense of these islands involves a concern for
                            the areas from which it could most easily be attacked.</p>
                        <p>You probably read the Resolution that was passed by the Congress, at my
                            request. The wording, as to areas outside Formosa and the Pescadores, is
                            vague. In view of what I have just said, you can understand why this is
                            so.</p>
                        <p>The Resolution, then, is our publicly stated position; the problem now is
                            how to make it work. The morale of the Chinese Nationalists still
                            remains important to us, so they must have certain assurances with
                            respect to the offshore islands. But these must be less binding on us
                            than the terms of the Chino-American Treaty, now before our Senate for
                            ratification. We must remain ready, until some better solution can be
                            found, to move promptly against any Communist force that is manifestly
                            preparing to attack Formosa. And we <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192"
                                facs="0220"/>must make a distinction—(this is a difficult
                            one)—between an attack that has <hi rend="italic">only</hi> as its
                            objective the capture of an offshore island and one that is <hi
                                rend="italic">primarily a preliminary movement to an all-out attack
                                on Formosa</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I could go on and discuss a thousand different points, with shadings of
                            each, that we have discussed and hashed over during the past two weeks.
                            Basic conclusions were scarcely involved; there have never been any
                            great differences within the Administration on fundamentals. Most of the
                            talks centered around the question of “what can we say and how can we
                            say it” so as to retain the greatest possible confidence of our friends
                            and at the same time put our enemies on notice that we are not going to
                            stand idly by to see our vital interests jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>Of course, only time will tell how successful we have been. Every day
                            will bring its problems and many of these will cause much more talking
                            and haggling—even some <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi>! More and more I
                            find myself, in this type of situation—and perhaps it is because of my
                            advancing years—tending to strip each problem down to its simplest
                            possible form. Having gotten the issue well defined in my mind, I try in
                            the next step to determine what answer would best serve the <hi
                                rend="italic">long term</hi> advantage and welfare of the United
                            States and the free world. I then consider the <hi rend="italic"
                                >immediate problem</hi> and what solution can we get that will best
                            conform to the long term interests of the country and at the same time
                                <hi rend="italic">can command a sufficient approval in this country
                                so as to secure the necessary Congressional action</hi>.</p>
                        <p>When I get a problem solved on this rough basis, I merely stick to the
                                <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> answer and let associates have a
                            field day on words and terminology. (I suppose that many of those around
                            me would protest that even in this field I am sometimes something of an
                            autocrat and insist upon the employment of my own phraseology when I
                            consider the issue important.) However, I really do try to stay out of
                            this particular job as much as my own characteristics, particularly my
                            ego, will permit.</p>
                        <p>Whatever is now to happen, I know that nothing could be worse than global
                            war.</p>
                        <p>I do not believe that Russia wants war at this time—in fact, I do not
                            believe that if we became engaged in rather a bitter fight along the
                            coast of China, Russia would want to intervene with her own forces. She
                            would, of course, pour supplies into China in the effort to exhaust us
                            and certainly would exploit the opportunity to separate us from our
                            major allies. But I am convinced that Russia does not want, at this
                            moment, to experiment with means of defense against the bombing that we
                                <hi rend="italic">could</hi> conduct against her mainland. At the
                            same time, I assume that Russia’s treaty with Red China comprehends a
                            true military alliance, which she would either have to repudiate or take
                            the plunge. As a consequence of this kind of thinking, she <pb n="193"
                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0221"/>would probably be in a considerable
                            dilemma if we got into a real shooting war with China. It would not be
                            an easy decision for the men in the Kremlin, in my opinion.</p>
                        <p>In any event, we have got to do what we believe to be right—if we can
                            figure out the right—and we must show no lack of firmness in a world
                            where our political enemies exploit every sign of weakness, and are
                            constantly attempting to disrupt the solidarity of the free world’s
                            intentions to oppose their aggressive practices.</p>
                        <p>Oddly enough I started out this letter with the complacent thought that I
                            could point up, in one or two paragraphs, the salient features of my
                            last two weeks’ existence. Now I find that after all these words, I have
                            only vaguely pointed out the biggest ones in this particular “can of
                            worms.”</p>
                        <p>When I see you in a couple of weeks, we can talk these things over more
                            fully.</p>
                        <p>With love to Grace, and, of course, the best to yourself,</p>

                            islands. While asking yesterday afternoon for urgent appointment with
                            President, I gave Acting Foreign Minister verbatim text of actual
                                statement<note n="5" xml:id="d72fn5">A copy is <hi rend="italic"

                            hour and quarter this morning with Acting Foreign Minister as
                            interpreter.)</p>
                        <p>After going over text in detail <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> asked me to explain phases “under present
                            circumstances” and “at this time” (in third numbered paragraph
                            Department’s 421). Did they mean that we would do thus and so now but
                            not in the future? I replied I should not attempt to read anything
                            additional into the statement, but added my personal view was that these
                            phrases were intended to relate our policy to specific conditions, such
                            as existed today, rather than to hypothetical circumstances which were
                            unforeseeable and might never occur. At same time I did not regard
                            statement as applying solely to present situation. President asked that
                            I request further clarification from Department.</p>
                        <p>Next point on which <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> laid
                            stress was whether effect of Congressional resolution would continue
                            after ratification of Defense Treaty. I did not comment on this.</p>
                        <p>Third item President raised was importance of some United States public
                            statement at same time Chinese announced Tachen evacuation. He appears
                            to have sent further instructions to Foreign Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> in this connection. I referred
                            to paragraph (number 4 in Department’s 421) in US statement just given
                            him and asked if he had received details from <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> of what Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said. He indicated his
                            information was meager. Said I am so sad few actual details at hand but
                            could envisage essential considerations. First, Senate would be willing
                            to leave large authority in hands of President as Commander in Chief,
                            but would not easily yield any of its power over international
                            agreements. Also there was question of relative advantages of formal
                            announcement re 1 or 2 islands and more general position which might
                            avoid appearance of inviting Red aggression on any islands. I supposed
                            military men should favor second alternative. I also reminded President
                            that conversations in Washington had gone through several phases during
                            past two weeks. What had seemed definite at one point might necessarily
                            have changed subsequently in light of new developments. I repeated that
                            while I believed these remarks pertinent they were not based on intimate
                            knowledge of details.</p>
                        <p>Under above circumstances and view fact defense pact hearings now in
                            progress and should not be jeopardized, I recommended acceptance of
                            position statement I had just given him as satisfactory basis for
                            requesting US aid in Tachen evacuation. I suggested he not insist on
                            further explanation of phrases mentioned above, adding that when good
                            faith is absent no use of words can bind a nation but when good faith
                            present, as in this case, one need have no concern over details of
                            wording.</p>
                        <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0223"/>
                        <p>President expressed appreciation of my remarks and quoted Chinese proverb
                            to effect one never asks friend to do the impossible. He now understood
                            US would not mention Kinmen and Matsu in public pronouncement but urged
                            appropriate statement be issued nevertheless. He expressed hope US might
                            agree to some mention of Kinmen and Matsu in Chinese statement on Tachen
                            withdrawal but I gave him no encouragement at this point.</p>
                        <p>President then mentioned present Commonwealth Prime Ministers
                                Conference<note n="6" xml:id="d72fn6">Held in London, January
                                31–February 8.</note> and expressed concern over reported proposal
                            Free Chinese give up all of offshore islands in return for ceasefire. He
                            asked US to put <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> straight on this
                            point. (I made no comment but cannot imagine US agreeing to reported
                            Commonwealth scheme.)</p>
                        <p>Finally President said that after Tachen evacuation he was considering
                            proposal in security council condemning Soviet aggression against China.

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> called at his request.
                            He said that he had received a message from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Sir Anthony Eden</persName> concerning the desire of the United <pb
                                n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>Kingdom to find the basis on
                            which to work very closely with us in the Far East. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> underlined that what he was
                            about to say represented the views of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir
                                Anthony</persName> and did not emanate from the Commonwealth Prime
                            Ministers’ meeting on which he so far had only skeletal reports.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> went on to say that
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> was reassured concerning
                            our intentions regarding Formosa and that public opinion in Britain was
                            clear on two points, first that the people on Formosa, who were
                            anti-Communist, cannot be turned over to the Communists, and secondly,
                            that the legal status of Formosa differs from that of the off-shore
                            islands. British public opinion, however, is confused by the lack of
                            clarity in U.S. policy with respect to these off-shore islands. It is
                            also uncertain as to the possible future use of Formosa as a base for
                            the invasion of the Mainland. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> agrees that it is strategically essential to hold
                            Formosa in friendly hands but he raises the question as to whether this
                            facet of the matter should be emphasized publicly as the basis for
                            policy. He is now asking whether it would be possible for the U.S. to
                            clarify its policy with respect to the off-shore islands. He believes
                            that broad support of the British public can be obtained for our Formosa
                            policy if it is reassured that the island will not be used as an
                            invasion base and that it is not our intention that the offshore islands
                            should be indefinitely held by the Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>The Acting Secretary replied that, without accepting or rejecting
                            anything that <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> had
                            said, he would like to communicate to the Secretary on his return
                                Sunday<note n="2" xml:id="d73fn2">February 6.</note> night the
                            content of <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName>’s approach.
                            He added that nothing crucial would arise in the next few days which
                            would require an earlier answer.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then inquired whether
                            he had any information or comments on the Commonwealth Prime Ministers’
                            meeting. The Ambassador replied he had received virtually nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then mentioned that he had discussed the question of the
                            evacuation of the Tachen Islands with the Secretary just before the
                            latter’s departure.<note n="3" xml:id="d73fn3">See <ref target="#d54"
                                    >Document 54</ref>.</note> He wondered if this movement was
                            imminent and he expressed the view himself that it would be better
                            accomplished before an attack was launched. The Secretary had indicated
                            that he rather expected the Nationalists would agree on a redeployment
                            the early part of this week.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> indicated that no
                            decision had been taken by the Nationalists as yet, but that it would
                            probably be forthcoming within the next 2 or 3 days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> mentioned the great
                            concern we have regarding Nationalist morale. It would be helpful if the
                            Prime Ministers in <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0225"/>London took
                            this important factor into account in their consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador replied that he had fully reported this element of our
                            thinking and believed it was being taken into account. He recapitulated
                            that there is agreement on the central point of the importance of
                            holding Formosa. He felt that the gulf which had been created by British
                            recognition of Peiping<note n="4" xml:id="d73fn4">In January
                                1950.</note> and our continued recognition of the Republic of China
                            was tending to lose an [<hi rend="italic">in</hi>?] importance,
                            particularly since he believed that the U.S. no longer felt that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> was likely to
                            regain control of the Mainland. The risk of war is over the off-shore
                            islands which Britain recognizes as Mainland Chinese territory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out the flaw in
                            this logic since the Peiping regime had never had control of these
                            off-shore islands. They had been continuously under the control of the
                            Republic of China which we recognized. To say that they belonged to
                            Mainland China was to fail to recognize the de jure or the de facto
                            situation.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> repeated that in his
                            view war arising from the offshore islands would not secure general
                            public support in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss></p>
                        <p>The question was then raised with the Ambassador of the necessity of
                            defending Formosa which it was agreed was necessary. How could a
                            build-up of a magnitude to be clearly directed against Formosa rather
                            than an off-shore island be overlooked or disregarded in light of
                            Peiping’s insistence that they were going to liberate Formosa and that
                            this was the objective of all their operations.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> closed the conversation
                            by asking again if it would not be best to evacuate the off-shore
                            islands. It was pointed out once more to him that there were military
                            and moral objections to any such proposal.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador left Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            reiterated that what he had said would be brought to the attention of
                            the Secretary on his return and that no doubt the Secretary would wish
                            to talk further with the Ambassador.</p>

                            and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> briefed the
                            Council concerning aspects of the situation in the area of Taiwan and
                            the offshore islands. The relevant portion of <persName

                            reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                        pattern of Chinese Communist conduct was now clarifying a
                                        little, though he warned that revolutionary regimes like
                                        China’s were ‘boisterous’ and hard to predict. They need
                                        foreign devils, and at this point the United States is
                                        playing the part of foreign devil. The emerging tendencies
                                        were these: (1) Freeing Formosa has become the main
                                        propaganda theme; the offshore islands are cast in a role
                                        secondary to this. (2) Formosa is wholly an internal Chinese
                                        matter, and one not susceptible of legitimate international
                                        interference. (3) U.S. policy is deliberately leading to war
                                        and accordingly there can be absolutely no accommodation to
                                        it.</item>

                                        predicted that the Chinese Communists were likely to
                                        maintain international tension for some weeks to come,
                                        without actually precipitating significant military action.
                                        The general objective would be to occasion maximum pressure
                                        on U.S. policy by the allies of the United States. On the
                                        other hand, the intelligence community did not estimate that
                                        the Chinese Communists were likely to deliberately attack
                                        U.S. forces engaged in the evacuation of the Tachens.</item>

                                        of Formosa and 125 miles from the Tachens. The situation had

                        <p>3428. For <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>. I had half-hour
                            conversation with <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> this
                            morning. Madame Pandit<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit,
                                Indian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom.</note> also present.
                            Atmosphere cordial and friendly but after conversation started intensely
                            serious.</p>
                        <p>After recalling occasion when we had entertained <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and Madame Pandit in New York in
                            1949 and our talks at that time, I told <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> that I was sure Washington would be interested in
                            his reaction to present situation in Far East. He smiled and then said
                            very seriously that question was enormously complicated but that
                            fundamental difficulty was that <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>, who was a man about whom he did not wish to say
                            anything derogatory because he had been his guest and had no personal
                            feelings against him, had been passed by, by history and that his
                            aspirations were no longer attainable but that <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> was nevertheless in
                            constant fear that <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> might attempt to invade the mainland with the
                            help of the United States. Besides this the air raids on mainland and
                            against shipping constituted continuous pinpricks. This situation he
                            characterized as a running sore. He said that as far as Formosa was
                            concerned Chinese Communists believed that it belonged to China which
                            had held it for 1000 years before it had been taken from them by Japan,
                            and all through the last war China had claimed that Formosa should be
                            restored to them by Japan at end of war. These facts created a most
                            difficult situation for <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName>. Moreover India had recognized <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName>’s Government, which made it
                            impossible for India to consider that <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> had legitimate claim to occupy Formosa as part
                            of Chinese territory.</p>
                        <p>At this point he reiterated statement that history had passed <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> by and compared his
                            position to Indian Princes who had been protected by Britain for so many
                            years and who after the separation of India from empire, no longer had
                            power to protect themselves. He said half facetiously, “we did not treat
                            them badly. We have given them pensions and now, although they no longer
                            have any power they are quite happy.” I replied that it did not seem to
                            me that there was any parallel at all between what happened to the
                            Indian Princes and what might happen to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, but that in any event it had already
                            been made entirely clear that the <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201"
                                facs="0229"/>United States was not prepared to throw <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> to the Communist
                            wolves. He replied that he of course understood that.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> said that in his own
                            interviews with <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> he
                            had not found him unreasonable. He referred specifically to a
                            conversation he had had with <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao
                                Tse-tung</persName> at request of Pope for release of a Catholic
                            Bishop which had resulted in release of Bishop after two days
                            consideration by <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> in
                            what <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> described as a casual
                            manner. He said he felt certain that the American airmen held by
                                <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao Tse-tung</persName> would have
                            already been released if the request from the United Nations had not
                            been coupled with a resolution condemning the action of the Chinese Reds
                            in holding them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> felt that greatest
                            difficulty in obtaining cease-fire would be to persuade Red Chinese
                            Government to come to New York unless they were first admitted to United
                            Nations. When I observed that it seemed to me that it was obvious that
                            there wasn’t chance of that happening, he said that he realized that but
                            that all that could be done was to wait and see what the result of the
                            invitation would be.</p>
                        <p>I then asked him if anything had happened during the Commonwealth Prime
                            Ministers’ Conference so far which he thought might be helpful in
                            bringing about a cease-fire. He replied that after the first discussions
                            the conference had postponed further consideration of the situation
                            until reaction of Chinese Communists to Security Council resolution had
                            become apparent. I asked him how long Prime Ministers’ Conference would
                            go on and he said until next Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d76fn3">February
                                8.</note> noon.</p>
                        <p>I told him that I personally felt that his wisdom and guidance should be
                            most helpful in bringing about a cease-fire which was, after all, what
                            everyone wants. He said in reply he was afraid that in present situation
                            wisdom was not enough, but that I could be assured that he would do
                            everything in his power to be helpful. He said “of course we leaders of
                            the free world must carry our public opinion with us. We are not like
                            the Communists who are able to make decisions without considering such
                            opinion in our own country. This limits our power of action.”</p>
                        <p>I ended interview by saying I appreciated what he had said and told him
                            that if there was anything I could do to be helpful to him I was
                            completely at his disposal.</p>
                        <p>I believe the manner in which <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> spoke, as well as what he said, evidenced the fact
                            that his experiences in the past two days in <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202"
                                facs="0230"/>the Prime Ministers’ Conference may have had a very
                            sobering effect upon him.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC1">James Hagerty</persName>’s diary entry for
                            February 3 describes a conversation with the President concerning this.
                            It states that <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> learned of
                            the statement when he returned to the White House from New York at 3:30
                            that afternoon; the President had already been informed of it by Senator
                                <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName>. After discussing a
                            possible State Department press release with Acting Secretary <persName

                                >Hagerty</persName> took a copy of <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s statement to the President, who was in his studio
                            painting. The diary continues as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“When I came in, I told him that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                        En-lai</persName> had just rejected an invitation to come to
                                    the United Nations. I said that his statement had repeated the
                                    usual attacks on the United States for aggression and
                                    intervention in Chinese internal affairs, that we had occupied
                                    Formosa; and that the Chinese Reds demanded we withdraw our
                                    armed forces from Formosa and the Formosan Straits.”</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> then read a portion of the
                            statement to the President. The diary continues: <quote

                                <p>“I told the President that I had talked to <persName
                                        corresp="#p_HHJ1">Herbert Hoover</persName> and gave him the
                                    gist of the statement that <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                                        >Hoover</persName> would put out. He agreed with that and
                                    then said, ‘You know, they (the Chinese Communists) are
                                    certainly doing everything they can to try our patiences. It’s
                                    awfully difficult to remain calm under these situations.
                                    Sometimes I think that it would be best all around to go after
                                    them right now without letting them pick their time and the
                                    place of their own <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0231"
                                    />choosing. I have a feeling that the Chinese Communists are
                                    acting on their own on this and that it is considerably
                                    disturbing to the Russians. This <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                        >Chou</persName> refusal must come as a great surprise to
                                    our British friends. You know, they were trying to get us in a
                                    position where they would solve the whole situation and stop the
                                    hostilities. Of course, they’re not too interested in Formosa,
                                    but Hongkong—that’s another story. They’d do almost anything to
                                    retain that.’”</p>

                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. He had suggested that the
                            negotiations on the wording be transferred to Taipei and be carried out
                            between Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> and the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that the Secretary had
                            explained we could not include Matsu and Quemoy in our statement as <pb
                                n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0233"/>we did not wish to pinpoint any
                            particular territory. He said that the President was opposed to
                            mentioning any territory by name but made clear that we will defend
                            certain related areas. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> also stressed that we were talking about
                            redeploying Chinese forces from the Tachens, not withdrawing. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Chinese should not wait until a large-scale attack had begun on the
                            Tachens before beginning redeployment. In case of such an attack the
                            U.S. forces might not be able to assist in the redeployment. If the
                            redeployment were carried out now, it could be described as
                            strengthening Chinese military positions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> understood that the
                            United States would not refer to Quemoy and Matsu in a public statement
                            but the Chinese Government would make a unilateral statement in which
                            they would refer to Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the U.S.
                            might have to repudiate such a statement. He emphasized that this was
                            not merely his word but the Secretary had said the same thing on January
                            28. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> read the final
                            paragraph from the memorandum of conversation between the Secretary and
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> of that date.<note
                                n="4" xml:id="d79fn4"><ref target="#d50">Document 50</ref>.</note>
                            The Secretary had said then that he wished the Chinese to avoid naming
                            Quemoy and Matsu in their formal statements. While it was the present
                            intention of the U.S. to assist in the defense of these islands, there
                            was no agreement with the Chinese Government or commitment between the
                            two Governments. The U.S. Government might have to deny any implications
                            which might appear in a public statement of the Chinese Government that
                            the U.S. had such a commitment. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said that in view of what the Secretary had
                            told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> on January 28 he
                            could not understand how the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> could make a unilateral statement
                            mentioning Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he did not say
                            that the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> would make
                            such a statement; there was no intention to make such a statement unless
                            the United States agreed to it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> repeated that we
                            could not agree to it. The Secretary had made this clear. He could not
                            exceed what the President had said and what Congress had authorized.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> then asked if the
                            President’s statement still stood.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said yes. The
                            statement which we planned to make with respect to withdrawal of the
                            Tachens, however, would of course not be made until the Chinese decided
                            to redeploy and asked us for assistance.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to inform Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_RKL1">Rankin</persName> that he, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName>, had requested the U.S.
                            Government to authorize inclusion <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206"
                                facs="0234"/>in the Chinese statement of specific mention of Quemoy
                            and Matsu and that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            had said this would not be possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that it was the
                            Secretary who had said on January 28 that it would not be possible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he felt our
                            draft statement on withdrawal from the Tachens did not help much since
                            it did not include the names of the two islands. The problem was to
                            offset the bad effect on morale in Free China of an announcement on
                            withdrawal from the Tachens and he did not feel that the statement would
                            be effective in this respect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the
                            statement indicated that the U.S. Government would extend assistance to
                            the Republic of China in defending related positions and territories now
                            in its hands, which was a broader statement than one which would include
                            the names of the two islands.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> then turned to the
                            situation in the United Nations. He thought there might be a period in
                            which new efforts would be involved to get the Chinese Communists
                            invited. London and other capitals might attempt to inject new elements
                            and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease-fire item might be
                            protracted for weeks or months. In this connection, he wondered whether
                            it would be advisable to pull out of the Tachens. He had mentioned this
                            to the Secretary briefly and the Secretary’s reaction was negative. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> thought that it would
                            have a bad public effect to withdraw from the Tachens before a
                            cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> recalled that he had
                            told the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> and Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that the Chinese
                            Communists would undoubtedly contemptuously reject the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease-fire proposal, just as they had now
                            done. They couldn’t accept <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            jurisdiction over Formosa any more than in the case of Korea. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> was reminded that he
                            himself had said that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            does not bluff. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            said that the best conditions existed now for redeployment of Chinese
                            forces from the Tachens and evacuation of civilians. It would be highly
                            desirable for the request to come now. If we wait until the Communists
                            start to attack the Tachens, the President might feel that as no request
                            for redeployment had been received we would not be in a position to
                            help. If this happened the Communists would be given a great
                            psychological victory, as they would be able to pound the Nationalists
                            on the Tachens while the U.S. stood by.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if a request for
                            U.S. assistance and withdrawal were made and granted, would the U.S. be
                            ready to consult immediately as to the defense of Quemoy and Matsu?</p>
                        <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0235"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said there was a top
                            American Admiral<note n="5" xml:id="d79fn5">Admiral <persName
                                    corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>.</note> on Formosa. The
                            fleet was waiting on full alert basis. We were ready to start operations
                            as soon as the Chinese made up their minds.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if we would be
                            ready then to take steps to implement the strengthening of Matsu and
                            Quemoy and begin consulting about it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that we would
                            assist in bringing the forces from the Tachens to Formosa and from there
                            they could be deployed to other positions. In our statement we would
                            refer to assisting the Chinese in redeploying the troops to other
                            positions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he thought
                            redeployment was a euphemism for evacuation. He wanted to know if we
                            were ready to formulate plans concerning Matsu and Quemoy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that was a
                            military matter but in his opinion we were ready to discuss this.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked if discussions
                            had been held on this question.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that as far as
                            he knew the Chinese hadn’t asked for discussions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> asked whether the
                            redeployment from the Tachens would be confined to withdrawal operations
                            or would consultation also take place on defense of Quemoy and
                            Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that in his
                            opinion consultations could be held immediately on defense of Quemoy and
                            Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he was glad
                            to hear this but recalled no reference to this point in previous
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> recalled that the
                            Secretary had said in the present situation the U.S. would aid in the
                            defense of Matsu and Quemoy, although we would make no public statement
                            on it. If conditions changed, we would not want to be committed. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> felt there would be
                            an automatic need for consultations when the order went out for the
                            withdrawal of the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he felt we
                            would be missing the boat if we did not seize the present opportunity
                            for redeployment. We had to work on a basis of mutual cooperation and
                            good faith. Without these what was said in statements would make little
                            difference.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that we seemed to
                            be stuck on the point of public announcement. He realized that there are
                            U.S. domestic reasons for not making one. He then said the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> had a nice reaction to
                            the President’s message.<note n="6" xml:id="d79fn6">Transmitted in <ref
                                    target="#d69">Document 69</ref>.</note> It had dispelled his
                            fears. There was still the question as to how to meet the psychological
                            impact of the announcement of the withdrawal from the Tachens. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he <pb n="208"
                                xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>had been rebuffed by his own Government
                            on his draft statement. He wanted to transfer negotiations to
                            Taipei.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> thought this would
                            only compound confusion. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> emphasized that the negotiations could best be
                            carried out between the Department and the Foreign Minister here. He
                            assured Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> there had been

                            unfortunate that the Chinese were now hesitating.</p>

                                    due to an error in the transmission of telegram 434; see <ref

                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s wishes. Revised
                            draft probably will be quite similar but shorter and tighter. Technical
                            reason for delay in this connection appears to be that Chinese
                            Government considers it has received no definitive reply to request that
                            reference to Kinmen and Matsu be included; also insertion of “which
                            Government of US deems essential” being held in abeyance until previous
                            point clarified. Foreign Ministry had been led to believe US reply might
                            be awaiting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            return to Washington.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> I felt US position
                            quite firm that no mention be made of any specific islands and that “US
                            deems” is essential. I remarked that in actual fact these two points
                            were of no more than psychological value and in retrospect would seem
                            unimportant. He assured me their draft would be cleared with Department
                            before issuance and expressed appreciation having US statement before
                            him to aid in his drafting. I noted that although US text had been
                            approved by President, its issuance naturally contingent upon
                            satisfactory (to US) Chinese statement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SC1">Shen</persName> said both Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> and he set great store by
                            issuing two statements simultaneously, since this would strengthen
                            effect and demonstrate full agreement between two governments. If US
                            statement delayed some time after Chinese it would appear as
                            afterthought.</p>

                            seemed to forecast this possibility in paragraph quoted.</p>
                        <p>There was nothing in Soviet attitude or action which would indicate that

                            It is of course possible that affair was carefully contrived maneuver
                            agreed jointly by Soviet Union and Communist China to enhance impact of

                            Western Powers. But this, I believe, unlikely since it is not
                            characteristic of Soviet Government to risk its prestige in an official

                            closely allied. Insofar as effect on West is concerned, while impossible
                            to judge from here, it would seem that adamant Chinese position would
                            react unfavorably against Communists and tend to enhance rather than
                            diminish support for US position.</p>

                            doubts as to degree of influence Soviet Union in these interim and
                            intermediary steps can exercise over Chinese Communists and I consider,
                            on existing scanty evidence, Chinese reply was not that anticipated by
                            Moscow when it adopted Soviet position in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> discussion. It would, however, be a serious mistake to
                            expect that Moscow will not now give full support to Chinese position
                            now that latter has been made public and official. Whatever degree of
                            difference in initial phases of this question, it is highly unlikely
                            that Moscow will give any indication of disagreement with Chinese
                            Communists in any outward form. This does not totally exclude
                            possibility behind scenes efforts by Soviets, possibly along lines
                            indicated by Sobolev, in regard to private meetings,<note n="5"

                                “put out feelers re possibility private meetings between Chinese
                                Commies and some <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> representatives.”
                                The reference was to a remark made by Sobolev at a Security Council
                                dinner on January 31. Telegram 416 from New York, February 1,
                                reported that Sobolev felt the Security Council was too large a
                                group and that “if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s

                        <p>On the larger issues, it is of course possible that Chinese Communists
                            have convinced themselves that they are running no serious danger in

                            victory for Communist China.</p>
                        <p>In connection with general subject Chinese attitude, … Ambassador
                            yesterday showed me telegram from their representative Peking stating
                            that it was generally believed there that Chinese would accept <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> invitation but only for discussion Soviet
                            resolution concerning US. … Embassy Peking also stated belief that
                            Chinese Communists realize they would need full and active Soviet
                            support in any serious attempt to attack Formosa and it was very
                            doubtful if they had received any encouragement or assurance from Moscow
                            on this point. In giving me foregoing … Ambassador asked that it be held
                            in strictest confidence since he had no authorization from his
                            government to show me this message.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I am of belief that general considerations outlined in my

                                <p>“1. I think that further resolutions or debates in the Security
                                    Council at present would do harm. The veto would be applied;
                                    feelings would be exacerbated; and in debate positions might be
                                    occupied from which later withdrawal might be difficult.</p>
                                <p>“2. Discussions should proceed privately between the British
                                    Commonwealth countries and the United States regarding ways and
                                    means (by withdrawal of troops or otherwise) of keeping the
                                    “offshore” islands out of the area of armed conflict (either
                                    major or local), while firmly preserving the independence of
                                    Formosa and the Pescadores. At the same time India, for example,
                                    could use influence privately upon Peiping.</p>
                                <p>“3. While Australian and other British opinion would be much
                                    opposed to accepting a risk of war over the “off-shore” islands,
                                    I feel strongly that the President should know how greatly we
                                    respect and rely upon his coolness, judgment and character at a
                                    time when the truculence of China’s reply must provoke hostile
                                    reactions and possibly some intemperate opinions. It is this
                                    feeling about the President which gives me encouragement and
                                    hope.”</p>

                            Acting Secretary the importance that is attached to making a distinction
                            between the off-shore islands on the one hand and Formosa and the
                            Pescadores on the other. Each has stated that he was reflecting only the
                            views of his own government but I think it is a clear deduction that our
                            position with respect to the off-shore islands is a major point at
                            debate in London. I have the strong hunch that what they are trying to
                            tell <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0242"/>us without putting it into
                            words is that they can swing all of the Commonwealth, including a
                            reluctant but sobered <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>,
                            behind our policy if we will indicate that we are prepared to have the
                            Chinese Nationals withdraw from all the off-shore islands and make our
                            stand on Formosa and the Pescadores. They are certainly saying quite
                            clearly that they are having great difficulty with their public opinions
                            on the matter of the off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>Both of these approaches, however, were based on the situation before
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s violent
                            rejection of the Security Council invitation and as this sinks in it may

                            President has been giving personal attention to your wires, for which he
                            is most appreciative, regarding Formosan situation, and has asked me to
                            convey to you his sense of the extreme importance of the maintenance of
                            Formosa and the Pescadores outside the Communist orbit. He attaches
                            urgent necessity to supporting a high morale on the part of the Chinese
                            Nationalist forces at this critical juncture and in face of persistent
                            and insidious efforts by Chinese Communists to demoralize forces
                            resisting them and to sow dissention between Chinese Nationalists, the
                            United States and our associates of the western world. These forces
                            represent a big investment of our effort, money and weapons.</p>
                        <p>President believes that there would be a severe blow in lending an
                            appearance of surrender of Quemoy and Matsu at this time and that this
                            would have a most serious effect throughout Far Eastern area. You of
                            course know that the Communists are fully aware of the possibilities
                            inherent in this situation and that they are exerting themselves to
                            exploit fully and to divide the western world.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing is for your background information and in the hope that it may
                            be of utility to you during the course of whatever conversations <pb

                            subject. It is my feeling, in which he fully concurs, that some of the
                            conferees may be overlooking this factor.</p>

                        <p>Soviet proposal therefore does not seem to be a serious move towards

                            reflect continuing Soviet concern over Formosa issue and desire to keep

                                    would, in circumstances at present peculiar to case, give rise
                                    to situation endangering peace and security, which is properly a

                            not be possible for us to help in the evacuation; if we were to attempt

                                stipulated that this was merely his preliminary reaction and should

                            out that the commitment we have given to the British not to announce
                            publicly our intent to take combat action in case the Chinese Communists
                            attack Quemoy and Matsu in strength was linked to the effort to obtain a
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease-fire, and that if the latter
                            proves unsuccessful, we are no longer committed on the former. The
                            President pointed out, however, that <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>

                            may be necessary to retire our carriers to Okinawa for refueling and
                            resupply. We might then keep them there, since this would involve only
                            twenty-four hours delay, no longer than the ships for the evacuation
                            would take to get up to the Tachens from Formosa.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador also stated that the communication given by Mr.

                            Ambassador on February 4 was identical with that handed Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_HSWG1">Hayter</persName> with the exception of
                            the opening paragraphs which were addressed particularly to the
                            well-known Indian desire for peace. The British Ambassador added <pb

                        <p>The Ambassador then handed to the Acting Secretary the attached message
                            from <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName> in Peiping giving
                            his analysis of the Chinese attitude regarding Formosa.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d90fn6">The message, headed “Message from Mr. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName> in Peking dated Feb. 2”,
                                stated that Peking’s basic point was that Formosa was Chinese
                                territory and that the whole situation was therefore an internal
                                question; this was a national issue on which no open bargaining or
                                compromise of principles could be expected. Among the points which
                                followed from this basic premise, the message noted, was that the
                                Chinese would not deal with the offshore islands separately from
                                Formosa. They regarded the U.S.–Republic of China Mutual Defense
                                Treaty as the occupation of Chinese territory and would not consider
                                the accompanying exchange of notes to be a reliable safeguard
                                because of their doubts about American intentions. They would not
                                feel internally secure as long as the Nationalist regime existed
                                under American protection. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</note></p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador was informed that word had just been received from

                            Matsu. However I agreed to ask for answer quickly as possible and to
                            request Department also communicate its reaction to Ambassador <persName

                        <p>Mention of Matsu and Quemoy is of course limited to paragraph dealing

                            than “in view of Government of United States”, but from context meaning
                            is clearly identical. I do not regard any of differences as important
                            and hope Department will share this opinion.</p>

                                <p>“Every genuine effort to relieve tension in the world, including

                                    proposal, however, cannot be of any help. On the contrary, it
                                    would put China and the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                        Kai-shek</persName> clique on an equal basis, asking for
                                    interference in Chinese internal affairs. This whole activity is
                                    to put Chinese internal affairs in the international arena and
                                    create two Chinas, a theme openly discussed in the USA which
                                    would mean violation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                    Charter. When <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                                    was here he said he would firmly oppose any violation of the
                                    charter. Because of these reasons we cannot take part in
                                    discussions within the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> which
                                    has no right to deliberate the matter. The representation of the
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>
                                    clique makes it impossible to accept as a matter of course. As
                                    to the question of relieving tension in the Taiwan area the
                                    cause is US occupation, intrusion and war provocations. If
                                    tension is to be alleviated, persuasion should be directed
                                    toward the USA. China would not refuse to negotiate with the USA
                                    on this question. If the USA has the slightest wish to negotiate
                                    they should accept direct negotiations and give up their war
                                    threats. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                                    could facilitate this by persuading his American friends. If the
                                    USA would think of using war threats to intimidate China or
                                    cause acceptance of the idea of two Chinas or continued
                                    occupation of Taiwan, it is a fantasy. If USA like to make war
                                    provocations let them do so. We say if the USA insist on war we
                                    will resist and never submit.”</p>

                        <p>(At this point in the text the Swedish Ambassador said in Swedish, which

                            Also at this point the interpreter had interrupted for a clarification

                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> summed up as

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> told me that he
                            thought <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> was extremely anxious
                            to have direct talks but did not want to appear to be asking for them
                            himself. He thought it significant that in his statement to the Swedish
                            Ambassador he put the matter three different ways. First, that China
                            would not refuse to negotiate, then, that if the US wished to negotiate
                            they would accept direct negotiations, and finally, if US wished to use
                            war threats China would resist.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> went on to say that he
                            felt that by indicating his wishes for direct negotiations so clearly
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had shown that he was in
                            a weaker position than one might have thought. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> also felt it was
                            significant that, as he put it, with all the possibilities <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had he had chosen the channel of

                            direct negotiations. It struck <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> did not want to use New Delhi or Moscow and that he
                            did not want a <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0261"/>Geneva-type
                            conference. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> thought
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> felt he had thrown the
                            ball to the US and <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            believed that the ball should be thrown back to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>. A form should be found, he said,
                            to throw the ball back without allowing <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> to say that the US refused any talks. Of course, he
                            said, in doing this one should not engage in polemics. One possible way
                            to throw the ball back to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> was
                            a reply from the <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> along the lines of
                            the following draft which he handed me and said that he would not, of

                                <p>From recent contacts with representatives of the USA, I have
                                    formed the conviction that at the present moment discussions
                                    going beyond the immediate issue raised in the New Zealand item,

                                    could not be proposed with any chance of success. As to the

                            that as a starting point, looking at the matter from our point of view,
                            it should be clear that nothing should be discussed beyond the off-shore

                            negotiations as such between US and China. The negotiations, he felt,
                            should be under the aegis of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I
                            asked him what he meant by this. Did he mean, for example, that he
                            should undertake negotiations? He avoided answering this part of my
                            question but said that he thought that the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss> might continue its discussions and end up with a
                            blessing for negotiations which the US might undertake on behalf of the

                                >Chou</persName>’s request for direct negotiations with the US would
                            not be palatable to Moscow, although he was sure that Moscow would be
                            informed. He considered <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s
                            message to him as the first indication that there would not be incidents

                        <p>The British Ambassador called at his request on the Secretary at 11:30
                            this morning. He opened the conversation by stating that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> desired to communicate
                            certain thoughts to the Secretary but wished to emphasize these have not
                            been discussed collectively with the Commonwealth Prime Ministers.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said that
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> did not believe
                            it would be profitable at the moment to continue the discussion of
                            substance in the Security Council. He recognizes, however, that some
                            meeting in the near future will have to be held. He is also inclined to
                            believe that the Soviet Union would agree to the wisdom of not pursuing
                            the substance in the United Nations now. However, when the time comes
                            for settling on some new procedure he believes it should be under the
                            aegis of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss></p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador continued that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir
                                Anthony</persName>’s principal concern now was the avoidance of any
                            incident so serious as to involve us all. The important thing is to stop
                            the fighting.</p>
                        <p>There are various proposals in the air. The one which <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> now favors is to continue
                            diplomatic exchanges. He would appreciate any suggestions the Secretary
                            might have regarding the form of the reply to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> proposal.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d96fn2">See <ref target="#d86fn2">footnote 2, Document

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> does not consider the Soviet
                            proposal to be acceptable but hopes that no doors will be slammed on the
                            general idea. The immediate step he has in mind is to go back to the
                            Soviets and say that he has noted <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>’s remarks to Hearst and Kingsbury Smith on
                            January 31<note n="3" xml:id="d96fn3"><persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                    >Molotov</persName>’s remarks in an interview on January 29 with
                                publisher William Randolph Hearst, Jr., and Kingsbury Smith were
                                released to the press by the Soviet Government on January 30 and
                                reported in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> on January 31,
                                1955.</note> when he said “hardly anyone would want to interfere”
                            with the Tachen evacuation, and when he also spoke of their anxiety for
                            a peaceful solution. He would then propose asking <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> if he confirmed that this is
                            the position of the Chinese Communist Government and say that he would
                            pass on any information received to the U.S. and other interested
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>Next the British Ambassador said that he was instructed to ask the
                            Secretary as the basis for any such approach (but not to communicate <pb
                                n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0263"/>to Moscow or Peiping) if the
                            Secretary could give a confidential statement of longer term U.S. policy
                            objectives. He referred to his letter to the Secretary of January
                                21<note n="4" xml:id="d96fn4">See <ref target="#d27fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 27</ref>.</note> in connection with which the Secretary
                            had made an express reservation regarding the future of the off-shore
                            islands. The British hope that eventually a line will be drawn down the
                            Formosa Straits and that Peiping will abandon any idea of an attack on
                            Formosa while Formosa abandons any idea of an attack on the Mainland. He
                            hoped that the U.S. desired to reach a similar long-term position. He
                            then added as his own inference that the British Government realizes it
                            will take time to reach a peaceful atmosphere and solution. Various
                            ideas were in the wind. One is the <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> proposal. Another is utilizing <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> as a negotiating
                            instrument. The third is direct talks between the Chinese Communists and
                            the U.S. He recognized that in the immediate future agreement on any
                            basis can probably not be reached.</p>
                        <p>In reply the Secretary said that on the first point regarding the United
                            Nations there was the matter of the uncompleted action initiated by New
                            Zealand. He inquired if the Ambassador implied a desire of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> not to table at any time the agreed
                            resolution.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> replied that as he
                            understood it it was the desire of London not to table it at the present
                            time. When the Secretary pressed him as to London’s views on a later
                            tabling, <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> answered that
                            he judged that the British Government had reached no hard view on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that he did not believe events should necessarily
                            prevent us from proceeding as agreed with the resolution. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s reply<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d96fn5">See <ref target="#d77">Document 77</ref>.</note> had
                            been no surprise to him. He could see advantages in bringing the fire a
                            little closer to the feet of the Chinese Communists. We should not give
                            the appearance of timidity in the face of <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-lai</persName>’s truculent rejection. He noted also that
                            the Chinese Nationalists disliked the idea of the resolution nearly as
                            much as the Communists. In any event, he did not want to decide today to
                            abandon <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> as he felt that there had been
                            no basic change in the situation. It was true that there had been no
                            agreement on tempo but there had been agreement on the resolution. He
                            did not want to abandon the idea at this time.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador said he would convey this reaction to London. It
                            seemed clear to him that London would not want the resolution tabled
                            this week. They hoped that the Soviets might exercise a restraining
                            influence on Peiping and to introduce the resolution now might well
                            result in a Soviet veto.</p>
                        <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0264"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had not had time to discuss at length the last
                            week’s developments with his staff and all that he desired to say at
                            this time was that he did not wish to abandon the plan for the
                            resolution. He agreed, however, that we should not move hastily.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of the reply to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName>, the Secretary said that he would like to give
                            this matter more thought. He said he had earlier told Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> that one thing was
                            quite clear and that was that the U.S. was unwilling to accept any
                            proposals, under the aegis of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> or
                            otherwise, which involved discussing matters affecting the Republic of
                            China behind the back of the latter government. Any such procedure was
                            completely ruled out.</p>
                        <p>On the matter of our long-term policy objectives the Secretary said this
                            was obviously a large subject. We hoped, as probably the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> does, that ultimately there will come
                            about sufficient independence between Peiping and Moscow as to create
                            the beginning of a balance of power relationship. As a result the U.S.
                            would not have to be so fully involved in the Far East as it now is.
                            With Japan weakened by the last war and the two Communist powers closely
                            allied, it was necessary for the U.S. to put its power into the scales.
                            Meanwhile, he felt the return of Japanese power would come slowly.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> interjected that he had
                            not been thinking in quite such long terms.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that, pending developments on the Mainland ending
                            the imbalance of Asian power as it now exists, the U.S. feels that the
                            only acceptable solution to it is a close association with the present
                            non-communist countries. This has been achieved through various
                            treaties. The value of any of them, however, is dependent on the
                            continuation of an anti- or non-communist government in their countries.
                            If such governments are subverted then treaties have little residual
                            value and there would be a corresponding shift in the position in the
                            Pacific. Our primary interest is the offshore island chain. The treaty
                            with Formosa does not cover, as treaty area, the islands immediately off
                            the Mainland. Our interest in them is not in their intrinsic value but
                            in their psychological value and in their relation to the defense of
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that we had gone as far as we can in tidying up
                            the situation without collapsing the morale of the Republic of China,
                            the maintenance of which is a large factor. If it were to collapse, a
                            lot of things would break quickly. The result would be serious in Japan,
                            the Philippines, and possibly through South East Asia.</p>
                        <p>Our actions have included limiting the area covered by the treaty to
                            Formosa and the Pescadores; the exchange of notes with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>; and the evacuation of
                            the Tachen Islands. These have combined to put a strain on the Republic
                            of China equal to <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>what it can
                            bear for the time being. Any action looking like further retreat would
                            be insupportable. He noted also that even our action in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> had been repugnant to the Nationalists,
                            and he said that he felt we had about exhausted our ability to do
                            anything further at the present time. It was up to others to make some
                            contribution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said he thought we should seriously consider whether
                            Peiping really wanted peace. (<persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> said that the British also are considering this
                            problem.) The Secretary noted that it took us a long time to really
                            believe what Hitler had plainly said and written concerning his
                            intentions.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if Peiping really has a peaceful purpose, the
                            off-shore islands lose much of their importance. The Nationalists now
                            appreciate that the only way they can return to the Mainland would be as
                            a result of a change in the internal situation on the Mainland and not
                            on their ability to fight their way back. If the Korean War broke out
                            again, then the Nationalists would have a role to play but only under
                            conditions of general war would that role be one of invaders of the
                            Mainland. If the risk of general war and the threat of a Communist
                            attack on Formosa declines, then the value of the off-shore islands
                            recedes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> thanked the Secretary
                            for a very clear answer to his question.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said he
                            thought the Communists were serious about their intention to destroy the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> regime but
                            not about an invasion of Formosa. He thought that if the Nationalists
                            stay on the off-shore islands and the Communists can inflict defeats on
                            them, the result will be weakening of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>’s prestige and position on Formosa. The possible
                            risk of a Communist take-over on Formosa from within was then briefly
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary promised again to give <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> within a few days any further thoughts he had
                            regarding the reply to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            and the matter of action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> He
                            expressed the hope that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers would not
                            formalize any position. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> said he did not expect this to occur.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then asked the Ambassador’s opinion as to whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> by his personal activities
                            was actually being helpful or in fact crossing the wires. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> disclaimed any opinion on
                            the matter. The Secretary expressed himself as feeling that when dealing
                            with Communists and Orientals it was important to keep the channels
                            clear. He doubted that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>’s volunteer operations on a free-wheeling
                            basis were contributing much. If he were to play any role in the matter,
                            he felt he would have to operate under instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary commented that prior to the despatch of <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s long personal letter to

                                >Lodge</persName> had expressed the firm objection of the U.S. to

                            his authority as Secretary General.</p>

                            <item>In their attitude toward the problem, the free nations in Europe
                                and Asia distinguish sharply between Formosa and the offshore
                                islands. In general, they support or acquiesce in our defense of
                                Formosa. But they consider the offshore islands do not involve our
                                security interests. They are satisfied that if they were in <gloss
                                    target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> hands we would not consider
                                trying to take them in order to defend Formosa even if it were
                                attacked. They feel that they are important only in terms of a
                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> intention to attack
                                the mainland and that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                                cannot be expected to acquiesce in <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                    >ChiNat</gloss> retention of such strongholds in their harbors.
                                Hence, they look on them as a futile hostage to fortune and the
                                symbol of a rash and quixotic policy. Thus, they feel that our
                                protection of those islands greatly enhances the risk of war and
                                thereby endangers their own security. This fear will tend to strain
                                the coalition and generate pressures to restrain us.</item>

                            <item>This attitude would put us in a difficult position if the <gloss

                                Matsus. A war arising over Quemoy would alienate our allies in
                                Europe and much of Asia. The lack of allied support would handicap
                                our conduct of even a limited war and might seriously impair our
                                capabilities if hostilities spread. This situation is likely to
                                tempt the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s eventually to
                                try to seize Quemoy.</item>

                            <item>The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> rejection of the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> invitation indicates that it
                                will probably be useless to try to settle the issue by agreement
                                with them. They have clearly stated as their primary objectives: (a)
                                retaking <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0267"/>Formosa; and (b)
                                replacing the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. In any negotiation they will
                                surely not renounce these objectives or their efforts to brand the
                                U.S. as the aggressor. If we are committed to defend Quemoy and
                                Matsu, we play directly into the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                    >ChiCom</gloss> hands. While continuing to assert their two
                                primary goals, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s can
                                focus on the offshore islands. Thus, they can divide us from our
                                friends; confuse the real issues; and hope to create sufficient fear
                                of a “useless” war to enhance the pressures for a new Geneva.</item>

                            <item><persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>’s proposal fits in
                                with this pattern. The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s
                                will continue to threaten and to harass the offshore islands and may
                                even seek to take some of them. Amid rising tensions, they will seek
                                a conference to abate them on their terms. Such a conference would
                                be the worst possible context for a solution. The very fact that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s took part would brand
                                any outcome as appeasement. Moreover, it would be hard to prevent
                                such a conference from taking up other questions such as <gloss

                                settlement. To frustrate the Communist design, however, it will not
                                be enough merely to reject <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"

                            <item>In this situation, our policy should be directed to disengaging

                                Formosa and the Pescadores. The free world and communist attitudes
                                seem to me to give us the chance to do just this. U.S. withdrawal of
                                protection from the offshore islands could be used to obtain general

                            <item>By this course we would make it clear that, in disengaging from
                                the offshore islands, we were not motivated by fear for the <gloss

                                of Formosa. We would have demonstrated both our contempt for the

                            <item>In my opinion, such a course would enhance the respect of the free
                                nations for our judgment, our restraint, and our sense of
                                partnership, without giving rise to doubts in either the free world
                                or the Communist Bloc as to our resolution. If the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s are determined to
                                precipitate a military showdown with the U.S. in the Far East, we
                                could then count on the support of our allies. While their actual
                                help in the immediate area might be modest, the effect on our
                                worldwide position and on the willingness of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> to support Communist China in
                                pressing the showdown could be decisive. In short, a program of
                                obtaining the free world’s support for our policy toward Formosa in
                                exchange for abandoning the offshore islands would seem to me
                                clearly to serve the U.S. security interest.</item>

                            that we believed that the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should not
                            come to a standstill and that something should be done this week, if
                            possible, to keep the momentum going. On other hand, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and some of our friends appeared to feel
                            that nothing more shld be done in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            and we did not wish to embarrass them. We had concluded, therefore, that

                            as to his official correspondence with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> replied immediately
                            that of course he cld do that, but there was the other problem of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s personal message to him
                            (see mytel 447, February 6)<note n="3" xml:id="d98fn3"><ref
                                    target="#d95">Document 95</ref>.</note> which had to be handled
                            in some way outside the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. I said at
                            once that this was something concerning which the US had no comment to
                            make and that, if he undertook it, it would be <hi rend="italic">on his
                                own responsibility</hi>. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> replied that of course the US shld not get
                            involved in the question; that it was his own responsibility but
                            something had to be done to keep the ball rolling and throw it back to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>. Unless the US objected,
                            he said, he would go ahead and reply. In the absence of an objection
                            from the US he wld do so, but of course he wld not do anything to
                            embarrass US if he knew this was the case. His reply to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> wld be to clear up the ambiguity as
                            to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s attitude toward other
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> channels than the <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>As for my suggestion for a report by him to the Council, he felt that if
                            there were a <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting at which he
                            reported only the official communications already circulated, and had
                            made no personal reply to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s
                            personal message, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> could well
                            ask what had happened concerning his personal message. He said that he,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>, cld go along
                            completely with the line I had suggested if he made some reply to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s personal message to
                            him. He felt he must throw the ball back and he was sure that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had, in any case, informed Moscow
                            of his message to <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>. If
                            my plan were to be followed there must be a sign of life from him on the
                            personal message. The minimum, in his opinion, wld be to tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> simply that he <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0270"/>had received his message. But,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said, the US
                            would be entirely outside the matter and wld not be involved. What he
                            must be sure of was that the US wld not be embarrassed.</p>
                        <p>I asked <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> if it was
                            clear that if he made his report to the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                >SC</gloss>, he wld not mention his personal correspondence with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>. He replied that he wld
                            not, and that in fact apart from the US, the only one who had been
                            informed by him of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s personal
                            message had been Dixon (<gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>).</p>
                        <p>I then asked him how he would frame his report. He said first of all
                            there was no need for a formal report and he wld say simply that he had
                            transmitted the invitation of the Council to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s in accordance with the formula
                            used by <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> as Pres and that he
                            had received <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s formal reply.
                            Nothing more.</p>
                        <p>I also raised the question of <persName corresp="#p_HD1"

                            interpretation of his role differed from ours. Of course he did not
                            speak for the US or for the Council; but that was a rather “formal”
                            story and we shld forget about it.</p>
                        <p>I told <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> that as far as
                            his reply to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> was concerned
                            our position was that we had no comment to make on his proposed reply;
                            that if he sent it he did so on his own responsibility; and that we
                            thought it exceeded his authority. He again said that his interpretation
                            of his authority differed from ours but that what he did would not
                            involve us—it wld be as if another govt had taken action which we might
                            not like but to which, of course, we would not be a party.</p>

                        <p>In addition, it seems to me that a mtg to hear so limited a report from

                            the contrary, we wanted to accommodate him as much as possible as to
                            timing and tone, but that we did not want to by-pass the <gloss

                        <p>The British Ambassador opened by saying he wished to talk about various
                            matters related to the Formosa situation. He said the Soviet proposal
                            for a ten-power conference to consider the situation in the area of
                            Formosa and the off-shore islands had most regrettably leaked in New
                            Delhi. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government considered this
                            leak unfortunate, and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony
                                Eden</persName> had accordingly felt obliged to get an immediate
                            reply off to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>. The
                            Ambassador believed the Secretary would find the reply satisfactory, and
                            gave the Secretary a copy. (Enclosure No. 1.)<note n="2" xml:id="d99fn2"
                                >The enclosures are not attached to the source text but are in
                                Department of State, Central Files, 793.00/2–955. The British reply
                                to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> was summarized in
                                a Foreign Office statement of February 12, printed in <hi
                                    rend="italic">Documents on International Affairs, 1955</hi>, pp.
                                454–455.</note> He said <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir
                                Anthony</persName>’s objective was to keep the diplomatic exchange
                            with the Soviets going while at the same time pointing out that the
                            Soviet proposal was unsatisfactory. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> did not
                            intend to comment to the press on the Soviet proposal, and wished to
                            keep secret the fact that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            has sent a reply. The Secretary read <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>’s message without comment.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said he had reported to London the Secretary’s recent
                            statement of the U.S. position as to the off-shore islands. He has now
                            received the views of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government
                            which he had been instructed to give us orally. Presumably, the
                            statement of the U.S. position and the views of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government had been considered by the
                            Commonwealth Prime Ministers now meeting in London. The Ambassador
                            thought it could probably be assumed that the British views represented
                            a consensus of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Since the stated views
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government were carefully
                            framed, the Ambassador thought it desirable to give us the exact
                            wording. Accordingly, he handed the Secretary an “oral communication”
                            (Enclosure No. 2). The communication noted that while the evacuation of
                            the Tachen Islands appeared to be proceeding satisfactorily, the
                            position in regard to the off-shore islands still gave cause for
                            concern. It was noted that the U.S. considered that it had gone as far
                            as it could for the time being “to tidy up the situation”. But if
                            hostilities should occur over Quemoy or Matsu the great weight of
                            opinion in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, and probably other
                            free countries, would not support U.S. intervention in the off-shore
                            islands, which were regarded as a part of China. The longer the
                            situation was left vague, the greater the danger of incidents. The
                                <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Government was <pb n="245"
                                xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"/>being pressed to define more clearly
                            its attitude as to the off-shore islands. The Government was trying to
                            avoid this for the time being, but could not continue the evasion
                            indefinitely, especially since the off-shore islands are generally
                            admitted to be in a category different from that of Formosa and the
                            Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the defense of Quemoy and Matsu had to be
                            considered in relation to the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. If
                                <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> could give assurance regarding
                            the security of Formosa and the Pescadores, the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> view as to the off-shore islands would be entitled to
                            greater weight. However the Chinese Communists say emphatically that
                            they intend to take Formosa. They do not make any distinction between
                            the off-shore islands and Formosa, and openly declare that the attacks
                            against the off-shore islands are part of the campaign to take Formosa.
                            The U.S. Government is bound to give some credence to the Chinese
                            Communists’ own threatening words. Under the Mutual Defense Treaty and
                            the Joint Resolution we must consider the relationship of the off-shore
                            islands to the defense of Formosa. If there were assurances entitled to
                            credence that the Chinese Communists no longer have designs on Formosa
                            and the Pescadores, that would of course alter our attitude regarding
                            the offshore islands, for the islands would not then be unquestionably
                            related to the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. We cannot take a
                            different view of the off-shore islands so long as it seems that an
                            attack on the off-shore islands would be a stepping stone or a prelude
                            to an attack on Formosa. The Chinese Communists could ease the situation
                            if they would give dependable assurances that they do not intend to
                            attack Formosa and the Pescadores. The U.S. position as to the off-shore
                            islands could then be reexamined. Under present circumstances, we must
                            assume that the Chinese Communists mean what they say.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador said the Secretary had made his position very
                            clear. The Ambassador understood, and he thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName> and the Commonwealth
                            Prime Ministers understood. The British Government was trying to find a
                            position on which it and the Commonwealth countries could give full
                            support to the U.S. If the U.S. should get involved with the Chinese
                            Communists, the Commonwealth countries wanted a clear issue on which
                            they could stand. The Prime Ministers did not believe that they could
                            get sufficient support in their countries, if the issue were merely the
                            off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he knew it was not an easy problem for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. He expressed deep appreciation for the
                            sympathetic understanding which <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had shown. He was aware that <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> had gone to considerable lengths to
                            support the U.S. position.</p>
                        <pb n="246" xml:id="pg_246" facs="0274"/>
                        <p>The Ambassador concurred, saying that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had “risked his neck”, politically speaking.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he was not unmindful of the risks <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had incurred. He hoped something
                            could be worked out but he felt that the U.S. Government had gone as far
                            as it could in the absence of a response from the other side. There did
                            not seem to be much hope in the present attitude of Chinese Communist
                            authorities. Any assumption that the Chinese Communists might now follow
                            a more moderate course would fly in the face of threatening Chinese
                            Communist words and deeds of the most formidable character.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that if the Chinese Communists should resort to
                            military action, the U.S. could not again be expected to afford them a
                            “privileged sanctuary”. It was not likely that U.S. forces would again
                            be bound by a line such as the Yalu River line of the Korean
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he would prefer to leave the foregoing statement of
                            the U.S. position oral and informal, if that was satisfactory to the
                            Ambassador.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that the statement was perfectly clear and he was
                            quite willing to have it left oral. The British statement was really an
                            oral communication.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador said that as to the next steps on the New Zealand
                            item in the Security Council, he understood that an agreement on
                            procedure had been reached in New York between <persName

                                >Telegram 462 from New York, February 9, reported that Dixon,

                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> had agreed that a
                                Security Council meeting should be held on February 14 to take note
                                of the <gloss target="#t_PRC1">PRC</gloss> rejection of the
                                Council’s invitation. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                793.00/2–955)</note> This was satisfactory to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and he need not bother the Secretary with
                            this point.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he understood that an interim meeting of the Security
                            Council was contemplated.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador confirmed this. He remarked that the British Government
                            shared the concern of the U.S. Government at the unauthorized
                            correspondence which Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> was exchanging with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he considered this exchange of correspondence
                            extremely dangerous. We were in a serious affair. The situation was not
                            improved by people meddling in it on their own responsibility. There was
                            a real danger that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s
                            efforts might be misunderstood in Peiping. Every word must be weighed in
                            a delicate situation such as now prevails, and every word needs to come
                            from an authorized source. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> seems to think he has a standing function
                            as an arbitrator between the two sides in <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>
                            <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0275"/>matters. This is a new concept,
                            which should not be encouraged. The Secretary expressed gratification
                            that the British Government shares the U.S. view on this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said the British
                            regarded the role <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> has
                            assumed as “outside his competence”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>’s intervention with the Chinese Communists
                            was very different from that which the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            had undertaken. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> representations
                            were highly responsible, and had been made with our knowledge and
                            acquiescence. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s
                            efforts were in sharp contrast.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that, apart from the question of competence, his
                            Government felt that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                            >Hammarskjold</persName>’s efforts inevitably would “cross some
                            wires”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he had invited Canadian Foreign Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> to have lunch with
                            him privately and informally in Washington on Sunday.<note n="4"

                        <p>The Ambassador thought this was an excellent idea. He said he had
                            suggested to London four days ago that <persName corresp="#p_PLB1"
                                >Pearson</persName> should stop off here on his way back to Ottawa
                            from London.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> be
                            informed that he (the Secretary) is aware of the fact that <persName

                            Far Eastern issues. He wanted the Foreign Secretary to know that he is

                            would be a good thing if <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            could carry out his schedule of visits as he could exercise very useful
                            influences in certain places. The Secretary mentioned that he was
                            planning to spend a few hours in Rangoon and also make brief visits to
                            the Associated States and Manila.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador agreed that the change in <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"

                            unavoidable for several reasons including the reluctance of <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented on the
                            progress of the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. The memorandum of
                            discussion reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    explained that the evacuation operations in the Tachens area had
                                    been proceeding very successfully in good weather. Barring a
                                    change in the weather for the worse, the task <pb n="249"
                                        xml:id="pg_249" facs="0277"/>would be completed at the end
                                    of the week. One U.S. aircraft had been shot down, but under
                                    circumstances which did not portend serious Chinese Communist
                                    operations. The pilot of this plane had become lost in the fog
                                    and was flying low over the Communist mainland when he was
                                    compelled to ditch his plane after it had been hit by 20-mm
                                    anti-aircraft fire. No Chinese Communist planes had actually
                                    appeared at the scene of the evacuation operation to this
                                    date.</p>
                                <p>“Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired
                                    as to the danger of Communist submarines. Admiral <persName
                                        corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that despite
                                    the report that one periscope had been sighted, our military
                                    people on the scene were inclined to discount the danger of
                                    submarine attack.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName

                        <p>Admiral Orem said that the Tachens evacuation operation should be
                            completed Friday afternoon February 11, or the next morning, Washington
                            time. This would be considerably ahead of schedule.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Orem then gave Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1"
                                >MacArthur</persName> a copy of a proposed press statement planned
                            for issuance upon completion of the evacuation. (Copy attached).<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d102fn2">The text of the statement, issued on February
                                11, is in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                February 21, 1955, p. 290.</note> He said the statement had already
                            been cleared by Defense, Navy and Air, and by Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> for the Joint Chiefs. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said he would
                            show the statement to the Secretary at once, and let the Admirals know
                            if there were any changes to suggest. It would be understood of course
                            that no statement would be issued without complete agreement.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Orem said he thought that possibly the Chinese would want to put
                            out a statement of their own.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said it was his
                            own individual view that we should merely inform the Chinese in advance
                            of our statement, and <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>not
                            encourage them to put out a related statement over which we would have
                            no control. If they wanted to put out a statement without any
                            encouragement from us, that would be their own affair. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> should have an opportunity to
                            give his views on this matter.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Orem said the Navy public relations Officer anticipated quite a
                            few questions from the press when the statement was put out. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> was willing to answer
                            questions in a generalized way. But he would not get into the
                            particulars of the new disposition of the 7th Fleet, etc.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Anderson</persName> said that it was planned that most
                            of the fleet would go to Subic Bay or Japan. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >Yorktown</hi>, would return to the U.S. as scheduled for some time.
                            Four aircraft carriers would be left in the area. The F–86 Wing now on
                            Formosa would go back to its base except for one squadron. The various
                            squadrons would be rotated to Formosa, one at a time. In answer to a
                            question from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName>,
                            Admiral Orem said that most of the communications personnel sent to
                            Formosa with the Air Wing would stay there. The authorized complement of
                            600 was never filled, and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> would be
                            able to finance the smaller complement which had been sent there. It was
                            needed for other purposes already planned before the F–86s were sent to
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName>Anderson</persName> said that the Chinese <gloss
                                target="#t_G1">G</gloss>–2 had reported a concentration of about 600
                            junks opposite Matsu, near Foochow. The Chinese wanted to attack this
                            concentration and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> had asked <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">Cincpac</gloss> for authorization. <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">Cincpac</gloss> had referred the matter to
                                <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss>. The attack had been okayed by
                                <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss> subject to confirmation by U.S.
                            reconnaissance that it is a real concentration of some military
                            significance. The White House is being informed through Col. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, although strictly
                            speaking, this is only required when a mainland attack is contemplated.
                            Admiral Orem doubted whether the concentration had real significance. He
                            thought the Chinese Communists would be foolish to concentrate shipping
                            in the vicinity of either Matsu or Quemoy at this time. Air attacks
                            might make sense from their point of view. However, Admiral Duncan
                            thought the concentration of junks might have some military
                                significance.<note n="3" xml:id="d102fn3"><p>A memorandum of

                                    with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>’s

                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he had called to
                            say goodbye and to express his gratitude for the great contribution the
                            Secretary had made to the important negotiations which had recently come
                            to fruition. He felt that no success could have been achieved without
                            the efforts of the Secretary.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commended Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName>
                            on the large and constructive role he had played in the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he would
                            travel to Taipei via Manila, where he expected to discuss with Magsaysay
                            and Garcia<note n="2" xml:id="d103fn2">Ramon Magsaysay, President of the
                                Philippines. Carlos P. Garcia, Vice President and Foreign Minister
                                of the Philippines.</note> the Philippine legal restrictions on
                            aliens in the retail merchandising trade, which had put Chinese
                            merchants out of business in the Philippines. This law had strained
                            relations between China and the Philippines. He felt he could negotiate
                            successfully with Magsaysay, who was a better man to deal with than
                                Quirino<note n="3" xml:id="d103fn3">Elpidio Quirino, former
                                President of the Philippines, 1948–1953.</note> had been. He said
                            that Magsaysay knew he had made a mistake in signing the law, but had
                            done it for political reasons. He understood that a joint committee of
                            officials and Congressmen had been set up at Manila to study the law and
                            consider the case for revision.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he felt it was a
                            matter of urgency for the U.S. and Chinese military authorities to begin
                            joint consultations as to the <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"
                            />strengthening of the defense of Quemoy and Matsu. Such consultations
                            could take place quietly so as not to cause any public flurry. They were
                            an imperative necessity since there was much to be done in a little
                            time. The Chinese forces must not be caught in a state of unpreparedness
                            if the Communists should strike unexpectedly.</p>
                        <p>In answer to a question from the Secretary as to the garrison on Matsu,
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said it was something
                            less than 10,000. He said there was also a small naval station there. He
                            confirmed that Matsu was within range of heavy artillery emplaced on the
                            Mainland. It was not as close in as Quemoy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary indicated that he did not have any objections to private
                            military consultations between American and Chinese military
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> thought that a
                            beginning might be made by sending small joint survey parties to look
                            over the ground. He said that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> would undoubtedly have some idea as to the best
                            way to begin joint planning. He would hope to consult him.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> recalled that it was a
                            classical Chinese custom for a traveler who was saying goodbye to a
                            friend to ask that friend for advice. He wished to ask the Secretary if,
                            out of the wealth of his wisdom and experience he had some advice to
                            tender.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had not anticipated a request for advice. However
                            it was very good of the Foreign Minister to solicit his views and he
                            would take advantage of the opportunity to set forth extemporaneously
                            some thoughts which recently he had been turning over in his mind. He
                            said that he believed more thought needed to be given to the role which
                            Free China should play in the situation now confronting us. It might be
                            important to prepare the people of Free China for a more realistic and
                            long range view of the situation. The people must be getting a little
                            disillusioned with hearing every year from the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> and other Government
                            leaders that they would march back to the Mainland in the course of the
                            coming year. When year after year went by without this happening, some
                            cynicism and disbelief must surely be engendered which might tend to
                            discredit the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the Minister should not think for a moment that the
                            U.S. wanted or expected to see Free China chained to the island of
                            Formosa forever. That small island must not become a prison for Free
                            China. But no one could say with confidence that non-Communist China
                            will expand beyond Formosa this year or next year. As long as there were
                            10 times as many soldiers on the Mainland as on Formosa, and as long as
                            these Communist troops remained loyal and disciplined, it would be
                            suicidal for the forces of Nationalist China to undertake to win back
                            the Mainland unaided. The resources available to Nationalist China alone
                            were not adequate <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>for the
                            purpose. It was not realistic to talk in those terms. The Secretary felt
                            that a Government cannot go on fooling its people year after year. There
                            was no idea among the American people in general, and certainly no idea
                            in this Administration, of confining the Chinese Government to Formosa,
                            but no time table could be fixed. The Chinese Government would have to
                            wait for an opportunity and be prepared to recognize and seize it when
                            it came. It would be necessary to wait for the forces of disintegration
                            which are certainly at work in Communist China to have some effect. At
                            some point the structure would be likely to crack. There will be unrest.
                            When people are ruthlessly deprived for a long period of those things
                            which they inately seek, they eventually react.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could envisage off-hand at least three
                            contingencies which might bring about a crisis for the Chinese Communist
                            regime. He could probably think of more if he had a little more time for
                            reflection: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>A split among the rulers of the regime. Dissensions might crop
                                    out which would have an extremely disruptive effect. The Chinese
                                    Government might be able to intervene then with weighty effect.
                                    It might wield the balance of power.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>There might be an upsurge of popular unrest. Forces from below
                                    in this case would upset the Communist dictatorship at the top
                                    even though the dictatorship remained unified. The ruthless
                                    exploitation of the people might lead to an upheaval. In such
                                    event the Chinese Government again might be able to intervene so
                                    as to affect decisively the power balance.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Finally, the possibility of large-scale hostilities could not
                                    be ruled out. We earnestly hoped this would not occur. But the
                                    contingency could not be dismissed. If the Communist leaders of
                                    China should precipitate war, the U.S. would expect the Chinese
                                    Communist forces to be hit from many directions—from the South,
                                    from Formosa, from Okinawa, and from Korea. The Chinese
                                    Government and its forces would have a vital role to play in
                                    this situation.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought it was important to think in these
                            long-range terms. He was not criticising the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> for the specific short-range predictions
                            he had felt constrained to make. The <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> of course was the best judge of the
                            requirements of his own situation. He felt that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> was a wise man and a
                            farsighted statesman. He had respect for his qualities of greatness. He
                            thought the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> might
                            wish to consider beginning to condition the Free Chinese people to this
                            longer range and less specific, but more realistic approach.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned the very bad conditions undoubtedly existing in
                            Russia. The Soviet Union had been subjected to very heavy demands.
                            Undoubtedly the Soviet Union was overextended. The Soviet Union was
                            trying to match U.S. military power with an <pb n="254" xml:id="pg_254"
                                facs="0282"/>industrial base only one-third or one-fourth that of
                            the U.S. Communist China was undoubtedly pressing the Soviet Union hard
                            for more military and industrial assistance. Through the Chinese
                            Communists, the North Korean and Viet Minh regimes were making large
                            demands. The military requirements in the European satellite countries
                            were heavy. The economy of the European satellite countries had been
                            squeezed. The satellite peoples were squirming under the demands made of
                            them. They were restive. The whole Communist domain was overextended.
                            The Soviets were trying to solve the problem by getting tougher. This
                            might serve as a stopgap measure. But in time it could aggravate the
                            situation. If the Soviet Union was overextended, Communist China
                            undoubtedly was more overextended and an eventual crisis in Mainland
                            China could be anticipated. The importance of having a Free China ready
                            to move into such a situation is tremendous. This situation might
                            develop this year. We hope there will not be a long wait. But no one can
                            be sure that the crisis will come soon. It might be some years away. The
                            important thing is to be ready and patiently bide one’s time until the
                            right moment comes.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that some of the
                            Chinese Government leaders have been thinking along somewhat similar
                            lines. Unfortunately it has become traditional for the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> to make a ringing
                            declaration on the “Double Tenth” every year. Like many senior military
                            men, the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> likes
                            high-sounding rhetoric. It has seemed to him necessary to hold out some
                            fairly immediate hope of return to the Mainland in order to maintain
                            morale.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he considered Adenauer<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d103fn4">Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of the Federal Republic
                                of Germany.</note> to be probably the greatest statesman active
                            today. Adenauer wants desperately to reunite Germany, but he refrains
                            from specific predictions and does not assert reunion will come about by
                            force of West German arms. He does not say it will happen this year or
                            next year. He believes the thing to do is to keep strong, cultivate the
                            necessary alliances, and be prepared for the opportunity. The time will
                            certainly come in both Germany and China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary wondered if the Chinese Government would not find the
                            German example worthy of consideration. There would seem to be a danger
                            that skepticism and disillusion might set in if the people are led to
                            believe that a successful invasion will occur in 1955. He felt the
                            Chinese Government must accept the evident fact that it cannot establish
                            itself on the Mainland by its own strength alone. The dislodgment of the
                            Communist dictatorship would have to come about through a conjunction of
                            events. The overextension of Chinese Communist resources probably would
                            become more conspicuous <pb n="255" xml:id="pg_255" facs="0283"/>because
                            of the youthful fanaticism of the new Chinese Communist regime. Although
                            the recklessness of the Chinese Communists might bring about a crisis
                            earlier than now seems likely, it is still impossible to make
                            predictions. The Secretary feared that the promises of the Chinese
                            Government which were not fulfilled might actually lower morale. While
                            no outsider could speak authoritatively of morale problems in another
                            country, certainly in the U.S. promises which are exposed as a bluff
                            have a negative effect. The Secretary said he would reiterate that this
                            Government “regards the disintegrative process as inherent in the nature
                            of a Communist dictatorship, and as inevitable.” The Communist regimes
                            are bound to crack. The leaders will fall out among themselves, or the
                            people will rise up, or both, or the excesses of the regime will
                            eventually cause all the non-Communist world to agree that the Communist
                            dictators must be driven out as enemies of mankind. The Chinese
                            Government is irreplaceable in the array of free world resources. The
                            Chinese Government must be ready for its role when the time comes. It
                            would seem wiser to be reticent about predictions and to husband the
                            strength of free China for the ultimate opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that some of
                            the Chinese statements probably represented a reaction to inaccurate and
                            irresponsible reporting by press correspondents and columnists in this
                            country. They had created so much confusion as to the real course of our
                            China policy that it could be readily understood why the Chinese
                            Government was confused. The people who have the responsibility for Far
                            Eastern policy in this Government knew that many of the reports freely
                            bandied about in the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> and the <hi
                                rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, and in the columns of such men
                            as Drew Pearson and Herbert Elliston are false. But people who do not
                            have access to policy could not know this. No wonder they were confused
                            and often discouraged.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that he had
                            discreetly used his influence for some time to discourage the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> from making exact
                            predictions about returning to the Mainland. At one time the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> and K. C. Wu<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d103fn5">Governor of Taiwan, 1949–1953.</note> had vied with
                            each other in fixing precise dates for the return. He thought the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> was now less
                            addicted to naming an early date.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that off the
                            record he would like to mention certain characteristics of the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>. First, he was at times
                            highly emotional and temperamental. This accounted for some of his
                            impulsive acts and displays of temper. Second, he believed deeply in his
                            friends. He could not believe that a friend of long standing could
                            betray him or lie to him. This trait was often a good thing but
                            sometimes was unfortunate. A good friend with sound judgment could <pb
                                n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0284"/>talk very frankly to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> and often
                            influence his decisions in a very useful way. It so happened that among
                            Americans, the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> had
                            a special liking for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>. He liked them as individuals in addition to
                            having confidence in their integrity and the soundness of their policy
                            positions. They could talk to him with the utmost frankness without
                            giving offense. And they could influence him. On the other hand, some of
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>’s Chinese
                            advisers had been entirely unable to convince him that some of his old
                            Chinese friends were unworthy of his confidence. Third, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> had the great attribute
                            of seeing clearly the only right course when a showdown came and a basic
                            decision had to be made. Although he was loath to accept a course
                            distasteful to himself when the chips were not down, he had the
                            remarkable quality of being able to accept an unpalatable alternative if
                            it was in fact the only one which would escape catastrophe. He perceived
                            how certain courses would be disastrous when this was not apparent to
                            lesser men. This was the mark of his greatness, as the Foreign Minister
                            saw it.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said that the false and
                            illfounded American press reports which Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> had mentioned had a very unsettling and
                            exasperating effect on the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName>. All of the adverse rumors about alleged
                            impending recognition of Red China, admission of Red China to the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, surrender of the off-shore islands,

                            trusteeship for Formosa, etc. were systematically cabled to the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> every day by
                            the Central News Agency man in Washington, who was very diligent in
                            digging up these reports, from mid-western and Pacific Coast papers as
                            well as those of the eastern seaboard. These were usually read out loud
                            to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> every
                            morning before breakfast while he was being shaved. Often they worked
                            him up to a state of great agitation and he would call the Foreign
                            Minister while still at the boiling point. The Foreign Minister would
                            point out that most of these columnists were thoroughly discredited and
                            should not be taken seriously. The <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> would often reply that he knew this, but
                            the writers must have some high level contacts who were talking along
                            these lines. He could not understand how there could be no foundation
                            whatever for such persistent reports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked that Drew
                            Pearson had been branded for years as an inveterate and malicious liar.
                            Elliston was known to be animated by an almost psychopathic bias against
                            the Chinese Government as a result of having been fired from a position
                            as Advisor to the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                            years ago. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            mentioned the outrageous falsehood perpetrated by Elliston a few days
                            ago when he alleged that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                        <p>The Secretary said that he never read the columnists. It was not worth
                            his while to pay any attention to them. If what they wrote about foreign
                            affairs happened to be correct, he already knew about it and it was a
                            waste of his time to read it. If they were wrong or misrepresented
                            things, it simply made him angry without his being able to do anything
                            about it. It was bad to get angry needlessly so he found that regardless
                            of the circumstances it was better for him not to read the
                            columnists.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> referred to the
                            earlier exchange of views about showing more patience in regard to the
                            return to the Mainland. He asked if mischief makers among the press
                            correspondents would not misinterpret a more restrained attitude as
                            indicating the development of a “two-China” situation?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there are two Chinas in the sense that there are
                            two contending Chinese forces, and two rival Chinese Governments. There
                            is still a civil war situation and it takes two to make a civil war. We
                            recognize the existence of the Chinese Communist regime as a fact, just
                            as we recognize the fact of the existence of Communist regimes in East
                            Germany, North Korea and North Vietnam. But there is no diplomatic
                            recognition. We do not recognize any of them as lawful governments. We
                            hope, expect and plan for the unification of Germany, Korea and China
                            under non-Communist Governments. We intend to help the forces of freedom
                            and we believe they will prevail. But we are not trying to force
                            unification by military means. We must be optimistic, awaiting with
                            confidence the chance which will come. There is no implication at all in
                            our awareness of the existence of a powerful Chinese Communist regime
                            that we recognize it as the lawful government of China. We don’t
                            recognize it diplomatically for any purpose.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> remarked that while the
                            opportunity to strike is awaited, all the non-Communist countries must
                            do everything they can to prevent the Communist regimes from increasing
                            and consolidating their strength.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he emphatically agreed. It was important to keep
                            the Communist regimes under economic and other pressures. The pressures
                            add to the strains which will lead to disintegration. He <pb n="258"
                                xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>thought the current Soviet situation
                            showed this. The pressures had resulted in failures of the Soviet high
                            command to meet their objectives. They had thrown out Malenkov,<note
                                n="8" xml:id="d103fn8">Georgiy M. Malenkov had been replaced as
                                Soviet Premier 2 days earlier by <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                    >Marshal Nikolai A. Bulganin</persName>.</note> the fellow who
                            symbolized the failure. The Communist leaders were faced by a dilemma.
                            They could not reduce their commitments, and they could not increase
                            their resources fast enough to cover their commitments. This sort of
                            dilemma tended to lead to a breakdown. Communist China must be in a
                            worse situation. The Secretary said he believed in continuing to subject
                            Communist China to all the stresses we could by applying pressures. Not
                            all of our Allies agreed with us on the efficacy of a policy of
                            pressures, and there were certain differences of opinion in this regard
                            within the American Government. He could not guarantee that every act of
                            the American Government would be consistent with this theory of
                            pressures, but he thought that would be the general approach and he
                            himself was convinced of the soundness of it. He said the evidence of
                            the last few days from the Soviet Union in his view had afforded strong
                            new evidence of the wisdom of keeping the pressures on the Communists.
                            The program of the Communists requires exertions which are beyond their
                            strength. A policy of pressures can increase the gap between their
                            requirements and their resources. The Soviet leaders have just realized
                            that the Soviet economy cannot provide both guns and butter. So they
                            have cut out the butter. This tends to make trouble among the Soviet
                            masses. This trouble will grow. The imminence of a crisis in a Communist
                            dictatorship is never readily discernible. The recent upset of Malenkov
                            took everybody by surprise, including the intelligence experts. There
                            were a few straws, but they did not point to such an early development
                            of a crisis. Many high Soviet officials were unaware that a crisis was
                            in the making.</p>
                        <p>We must have faith that the dissolution of this evil system is gradually
                            taking place even when there is no surface evidence. The Secretary
                            quoted St. Paul: “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the
                            evidence of things not seen.” We must know in our hearts that Communism
                            contains the seeds of its own destruction. External pressures hasten the
                            destructive process.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the danger in vigorous application of a policy of
                            pressures was that a totalitarian regime when near the point of break-up
                            may lash out recklessly in order to avoid or postpone an internal
                            crisis. He believed that World War I was brought about more because of
                            such a lashing out by the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian autocracies,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1"
                                >Winston</persName></hi>: I have heard how earnestly you supported
                            throughout the Conference of Prime Ministers the proposition that
                            nothing must create a serious rift in British-American relationships.
                            Not only do I applaud that sentiment, but I am most deeply grateful to
                            you for your successful efforts.</p>
                        <p>I realize that it has been difficult, at times, for you to back us up in
                            the Formosa question and, for this reason, I want to give you a very
                            brief account of our general attitude toward the various factors that
                            have dictated the course we have taken. You understand, of course, that
                            we have certain groups that are violent in their efforts to get us to
                            take a much stronger, even a truculent position. The number that would
                            like to see us clear out of Formosa is negligible. I know that on your
                            side of the water you have the exact opposite of this situation.</p>
                        <p>Because the Communists know these facts, there is no question in my mind
                            that one of the principal reasons for their constant pressing on the
                            Asian frontier is the hope of dividing our two countries. I am sure that
                            we, on both sides of the water, can make quite clear that, no matter
                            what may be our differences in approach or even sometimes our
                            differences in important convictions, nothing is ever going to separate
                            us or destroy our unity in opposing Communist aggression.</p>
                        <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>We believe that if international Communism should penetrate the island
                            barrier in the Western Pacific and thus be in a position to threaten the
                            Philippines and Indonesia immediately and directly, all of us, including
                            the free countries of Europe, would soon be in far worse trouble than we
                            are now. Certainly that whole region would soon go.</p>
                        <p>To defend Formosa the United States has been engaged in a long and costly
                            program of arming and sustaining the Nationalist troops on that island.
                            Those troops, however, and <persName>Chiang</persName> himself, are not
                            content, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, to accept irrevocably and
                            permanently the status of “prisoners” on the island. They are held
                            together by a conviction that some day they will go back to the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence, their attitude toward Quemoy and the Matsus, which they
                            deem the stepping stones between the two hostile regions, is that the
                            surrender of those islands would destroy the reason for the existence of
                            the Nationalist forces on Formosa. This, then, would mean the almost
                            immediate conversion of that asset into a deadly danger, because the
                            Communists would immediately take it over.</p>
                        <p>The Formosa Resolution, as passed by the Congress, is our publicly stated
                            position; the problem now is how to make it work. The morale of the
                            Chinese Nationalists is important to us, so for the moment, and under
                            existing conditions, we feel they must have certain assurances<note

                                    about the word ‘assurances’ made to the Nationalists. I said
                                    that the word was not used in any technical sense of an
                                    agreement or commitment but merely that present circumstances
                                    were somewhat reassuring to them and thus partly offset the
                                    damage to their morale instant to the evacuation of the

                            yesterday by the Senate.<note n="3" xml:id="d104fn3">The Senate approved

                                the Committee reported the treaty favorably to the Senate on
                                February 8. The record of those sessions and the report are printed

                                782–793.</note> We must remain ready, until some better solution can
                            be found, to move promptly against any Communist force that is
                            manifestly preparing to attack Formosa. And we must make a
                            distinction—(this is a difficult one)—between an attack that has <hi
                                rend="italic">only</hi> as its objective the capture of an off-shore
                            island and one that is primarily a preliminary movement to an all-out
                            attack on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Whatever now is to happen, I know that nothing could be worse than global
                            war.</p>
                        <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0289"/>
                        <p>I do not believe that Russia wants war at this time—in fact, I do not
                            believe that even if we became engaged in a serious fight along the
                            coast of China, Russia would <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to intervene
                            with her own forces. She would, of course, pour supplies into China in
                            an effort to exhaust us and certainly would exploit the opportunity to
                            separate us from your country. But I am convinced that Russia does not
                            want, at this moment, to experiment with means of defense against the
                            bombing that we <hi rend="italic">could</hi> conduct against her
                            mainland. At the same time, I assume that Russia’s treaty with Red China
                            comprehends a true military alliance, which she would either have to
                            repudiate or take the plunge. She would probably be in a considerable
                            dilemma if we got into war with China. It would not be an easy decision
                            for the men in the Kremlin, in my opinion. But all this is no excuse for
                            fighting China. We believe our policy is the best that we can design for
                            staying out of such a fight.</p>
                        <p>In any event, we have got to do what we believe to be right—if we can
                            figure out the right—and we must show no lack of firmness in a world
                            where our political enemies exploit every sign of weakness, and are
                            constantly attempting to disrupt the solidarity of the free world’s
                            intentions to oppose their aggressive practices.</p>
                        <p>Though thus sketchily presented, this has been the background of our
                            thinking leading up to the present day. I devoutly hope that history’s
                            inflexible yardstick will show that we have done everything in our
                            power, and everything that is right, to prevent the awful catastrophe of
                            another major war.</p>
                        <p>I am sending you this note, not merely because of my realization that
                            you, as our great and trusted ally, are entitled to have our thoughts on

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSPC1">Sir Percy</persName> opened the conversation
                            by saying that he had been instructed by Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> to come in and relay to the
                            Secretary certain views he held on these matters following the
                            discussion at London and in turn to solicit the Secretary’s reaction
                            thereto.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the sole and only commitment we have is to hold
                            Formosa and the Pescadores. Our treaty with <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            as well as the Congressional resolution makes this clear. He said we are
                            in agreement with the Australians on the premise that Formosa and the
                            Pescadores must be held. Our only difference, therefore, is as to how
                            this should be accomplished. Until September we had thought it might be
                            accomplished without retaining control of the small offshore islands. We
                            have altered this after taking into account a number of considerations.
                            First was that it became clear that the evacuation or the conquest of
                            the Tachen Islands would be inevitable as they are not militarily
                            defensible without a commitment of U.S. power over and above their
                            importance. Their location and the Communist air complex relatively
                            nearby would, for instance, have made it necessary for us practically to
                            anchor in the neighborhood of the islands a considerable part of our
                            carrier strength. We then had to appraise the loss of these islands in
                            the light of a number of factors; the important one being how big a
                            victory could we afford to see the Communists win without imperiling the
                            morale and the eventual security not only of Formosa but of the whole
                            region. We had concluded that the Communists could not be afforded more
                            of a victory than the Tachen Islands and that this could be afforded
                            only if accompanied <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0291"/>by a
                            stronger U.S. defensive posture. The Secretary emphasized that this was
                            a carefully weighed decision.</p>
                        <p>He commented that we do not yet know the full psychological impact of the
                            loss of the Tachen Islands. When the Communists move in and take over
                            they may launch a propaganda campaign which will multiply its effect on
                            morale and might be very serious.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the Prime Minister’s point that the
                            islands are not vital from the military point of view. He said in the
                            technical sense that their loss would not mean the loss of the
                            Philippines and Japan but he said we had to consider the morale of the
                            400,000 Nationalist troops. He said these forces were vitally important.
                            Neither we nor, for instance, the Australians would be in a position to
                            replace them. We had concluded that additional losses beyond the Tachens
                            would so gravely affect the morale of these troops that a climate might
                            be established under which the Communists could obtain Formosa from
                            within by subversion.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then stressed that we are not committed to anybody as to
                            what we do about the remaining off-shore islands. The decision is
                            entirely ours. He said the [<hi rend="italic">that</hi>] Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> had never made a
                            statement such as attributed to him in today’s press.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d105fn2">The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reported
                                that morning that <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> told
                                reporters that the United States was pledged to defend all the
                                offshore islands.</note></p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the assumption sometimes made that the
                            Chinese Communists would stop their aggression if they obtained the
                            off-shore islands. The Secretary said there was no evidence whatsoever
                            to back up such an assumption and he thought it was a very dangerous
                            one. The Chinese Communists do not talk about taking Quemoy and Matsu
                            but about conquering Formosa. We are in effect in a war today over
                            Formosa and he thought it was dangerous to think we could win such a
                            struggle by retreat.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSPC1">Spender</persName> inquired if we
                            feel the Chinese Communists could mount an attack on Formosa. The
                            Secretary while not replying directly said the important thing was that
                            they might feel that they could do so. The Secretary referred to a
                            statement made by a knowledgeable member of the British Labor Party
                            group which had gone to China<note n="3" xml:id="d105fn3">A British
                                Labour Party delegation visited the People’s Republic of China in
                                August 1954. The reference is apparently to a conversation with a
                                member of the delegation reported in telegram 560 from Tokyo,
                                September 6, 1954; see <ref target="frus1952-54v14p1#pg_573"><hi

                            the Chinese might feel that a considerable expenditure of men and
                            treasure would be worthwhile in such an enterprise even if it failed
                            because of the value they might attach to its propaganda value in Asia
                            and its divisive effect among the Western allies.</p>
                        <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that the battle was really on and that there will
                            be no more privileged sanctuary as in Korea. He said the 16 Korean
                            partners were now in agreement on that, as regards Korea. He said we
                            were not prepared to accept a line say in the middle of the Straits
                            beyond which we would have no interest. He added also that in this case
                            there was no <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action and apparently no
                            prospect thereof and that, therefore, the U.S. must use its own best
                            judgment. He said the islands had been held for five years and with the
                            exception of one incident in 1949,<note n="4" xml:id="d105fn4">The
                                Nationalists successfully resisted a Communist attack on Quemoy in
                                October 1949.</note> there had been no tension during this period.
                            It was only when the Communists started their propaganda about taking
                            Formosa last fall that the tension arose. He added that the islands
                            blocked the harbors which are the natural staging grounds for an
                            invasion. In summary the Secretary said that we felt to disengage from
                            these islands would seriously affect morale in Formosa and in the area
                            generally, there was no assurance that such an action would reduce
                            tensions, that on the contrary it might aggravate the situation even
                            more and that at the same time it would make an attack on Formosa
                            easier. We may be right or we may be wrong but this is our best judgment
                            and it is a considered judgment. The Secretary said our position was not
                            necessarily one to be maintained for all time but that we must continue
                            to use our best judgment on it in the light of developments. When a
                            situation may be reached where the considerations outlined above do not
                            in our opinion have the same force they have today we might be prepared
                            to revise our position.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to how <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjöld</persName> had returned from his mission empty-handed
                            and mentioned to the Ambassador the picture incident.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he hoped that Australia understood that the U.S. was
                            not being reckless and that we did not want war. The Secretary said he
                            felt we had been calm and careful. Our major interest is to see that the
                            Chinese Communists do not succeed in driving a wedge into the island
                            chain of defense. This would be an immediate disaster for a country such
                            as Australia and an ultimate disaster for the U.S. He said in these days
                            when some democracies were weak and divided that he felt countries
                            having a direct interest in this situation should be glad to see the
                            strength and the political unity on the matter which is present here in
                            the U.S. We do not pretend perfection but we are strong and we are
                            united and under the circumstances we deserve the support of countries
                            in peril. He expressed the <pb n="265" xml:id="pg_265" facs="0293"/>hope
                            that minor difference with allies not be exploited or blown up into

                        <p>3578. Eyes only Secretary. I saw <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> this afternoon. He asked me to tell you how
                            thoroughly he appreciated your difficulties regarding Formosan situation
                            and how much he sympathizes with you in having to solve these problems.
                            He had on his desk a copy of Paris edition of <hi rend="italic">Herald

                            opinion of the Prime Ministers at the Commonwealth conference to an
                            extraordinarily exact degree. He pointed particularly to the sentence
                            which reads, “These considerations apply to the other offshore islands,
                            and the sound American policy would be to follow up what is being done
                            in the Tachens by doing the same thing in Quemoy and Matsu.” He said
                            that this sentence expressed the hope of everyone who was at the
                            Conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> was very much pleased when I
                            told him that you were arranging to see <persName corresp="#p_PLB1"
                                >Pearson</persName> on Sunday and said that he felt sure that you

                            already taken position that no conference should be held without Chinese
                            Nationalists present, but he would like to know what sort of a

                            Nationalists would be invited to participate. If you do not think it
                            wise to have a conference, do you think some sort of a committee or
                            group might be set up to consider possible solutions of present

                                <item>“I have formed the conviction that discussion beyond the scope

                                    took pains to emphasize the “I”.)</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>He noted the reasons stated by <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                        >Chou</persName> for excluding the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                        >SC</gloss>. He assumed that other procedures under <gloss
                                        target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> aegis were not excluded.
                                    (Secretary General emphasized this last point had been
                                    formulated as statement rather than question.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Secretary General then read portions of <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s latest reply, pointing out that he was not
                            “transmitting” it to us, and commenting that it was “curiously open and
                            non-diplomatic” in its language.</p>
                        <p>Gist of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s message as follows:
                            First, he regretted that situation was as Secretary General supposed.
                            Secretary General’s point number two was contrary to what <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had in mind. In Chinese Communist
                            view even New Zealand item imposing cease-fire cannot go on Council’s
                            agenda. A recognition of “two Chinas” was unacceptable to him. “US must
                            sit down with China in face-to-face negotiations.”</p>
                        <p>There followed a long portion, which Secretary General did not read, and
                            which apparently contained standard Communist line regarding “US threats
                            to China”. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> then returned to
                            two China idea stating it was impossible so long as American forces
                            remained in the Straits of Formosa. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> said that present scheme, which he still attributes
                            to US, to induce Chinese participation in discussions and thereby bring
                            about recognition of two Chinas was out of question.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> said, must not intervene in this internal matter.
                            China was determined to resist the war-like threats of the US.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> went on, would one day have to recognize his
                            government and recognize also the mistake in having excluded him.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> drew unfavorable
                            comparison between mere invitation to him while <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>’s representatives had
                            seat in Council.</p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> then recalled his talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> and stated that
                            since he, Secretary General, appeared concerned, he should not “lack
                            understanding” of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s attitude.
                            In this there were two elements: (A) The New Zealand item was
                            unacceptable and (B) presence of <persName>Chiang</persName>’s
                            representative was equally unacceptable. For <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> to have someone sit down with
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>’s representative would be to recognize
                            existence of two Chinas. <hi rend="italic"><gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                    >USUN</gloss> comment:</hi> Note the repetition.</p>
                        <p>As for the methods of conducting negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> said this was a subject for study in which
                            connection he referred to Soviet role and referred also to Indians. He
                            said China would facilitate any endeavor considered by China to be
                            useful.</p>
                        <p>Swedish Ambassador Peking commented on above message that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s attitude re <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had noticeably stiffened and that in
                            emphasizing negotiations outside <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> hoped some means would
                            provide possibility of coming to terms closer to those he desired.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s comment re <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s reply was that it was most
                            interesting in that it clarified that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s main trouble was in sitting down with Chinese
                            Nationalists, since that implies to him recognition of two Chinas, with
                            which he was not prepared to agree. This was, in Secretary General’s
                            view, new element in situation. Only other new element was that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> was trying to get things
                            outside <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> where he could hope for better
                            deal.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> felt that relatively
                            informal style of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s reply,
                            plus contents thereof were not “the reaction of a man intent on wild
                            adventures”. If <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> could not get
                            negotiations, however, that would seem to be another matter, according
                            to <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>. But <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s behavior during Tachen evacuation
                            should be noted as supporting theory <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> really desired negotiation.</p>
                        <p>Recalling again that he was not “transmitting” it, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> said he regarded this
                            message as the end of their exchange on this subject. In his opinion,
                            therefore, Sobolev (<gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>) would not
                            bring up possibility of outside negotiation in his <gloss
                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> interventions. Secretary General also
                            felt <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> would not use his
                            proposal for direct negotiations for propaganda purposes. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> seemed much relieved at
                            this development since he feared this matter might come out in public.
                            In his opinion <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had barred
                            himself from such development.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName> regards this operation
                            as a useful clarification without having paid any price for it.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Contrary to <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjöld</persName>’s assumption that <persName

                            propaganda out of his exchange with Secretary General, it seems to us
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> may well have laid
                            groundwork for possible future use in public to claim US is not

                        <p>Evacuation of Tachens proceeding better than expected. Particularly US
                            Navy and <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> but also Chinese military
                            and civilian organizations handling troops and refugees are all doing
                            splendid jobs. However this is not operation to be [repeated?] if
                            Formosa and other areas of Asia are to be saved from communism.</p>
                        <p>Militarily, Tachens may not be particularly important but psychological
                            effect of new Communist advance evidently is most damaging to US cause.
                            Still further enemy advance would compound bad psychological effect and
                            also bring serious military disadvantages to Free China and US. Reds
                            evidently are moving their military strength south once more, this time
                            along coastline. Air bases are being developed to control sky over
                            coastal areas and eliminate any serious interference with coastwise
                            shipping which is essential to supplying those bases and for any other
                            military buildup close to Formosa; this in view of totally inadequate
                            internal communication in Chekiang and Fukien as well as absence any
                            prospect of a significant Communist naval power in this area.
                            Elimination of Nationalists from offshore islands evidently is intended
                            secure coastal supply route and permit eventual dispute air control over
                            Formosa Strait. This would be pre-requisite to attack on Formosa itself
                            or to securing flank during Communist adventures farther south where
                            Formosa being saved for future attention.</p>
                        <p>Offshore islands have little significance in themselves as jumping off
                            points for possible Nationalist invasion of mainland or as springboards
                            for Red attack on Formosa. But they are extremely important to defense
                            of Formosa. Only valid military argument for evacuating Tachens it seems
                            to me is that distance from Formosa makes fair support and supply
                            difficult and costly. Next significant island group to south (Nanchi or
                            Nanki) is 75 nautical miles nearer and correspondingly easier to
                            support. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> is restudying defense of
                            Nanchi as matter of urgency but tentative conclusions are that it can
                            and should be held, along with Matsu and Kinmen groups. “Groups” include
                            nearby positions essential to defense of main island in each group.</p>
                        <p>When Nationalist Air Force and Navy have received additional equipment
                            already scheduled for delivery in next few months they <pb n="269"
                                xml:id="pg_269" facs="0297"/>be able to assume full responsibility
                            for defense of offshore islands against anything short of major Red
                            effort. Even Nanchi, most distant island, presumably can be given
                            adequate air cover from bases in North Formosa, thus eliminating need
                            for carrier support. Meanwhile, I believe Commander Seventh Fleet should
                            have orders to extend any necessary air and naval support to defenders
                            of 3 principal remaining offshore island groups.</p>
                        <p>I still do not believe Reds intend to provoke large-scale conflict in
                            near future but it may require some military engagement to convince them
                            of our firm intentions. If such engagement should occur, then Nanchi
                            might well be as favorable location as any since in all probability
                            action would be over in few hours; it would be around friendly rather
                            than enemy territory; it should give us a much longer breathing spell
                            than any new withdrawal: Communist move southward would be interfered
                            with more than 100 miles north of Formosa Strait to advantage of Formosa
                            itself and points south. Essential steps to implementing above include
                            making clear to Chinese Nationalists what kind of effort we want them to
                            make in holding offshore islands; also US undertaking to replace, within
                            reason, military equipment lost by Nationalists in carrying out our
                            wishes.</p>

                        <p>At the 691st meeting of the United Nations Security Council on February
                            14, the Council adopted an agenda which included the same items as on
                            its January 31 agenda. (See <ref target="#d66">Document 66</ref>) After
                            discussion relating to the New Zealand item and the People’s Republic of

                            consideration of the Soviet item was rejected by 10 votes to 1 (the
                            Soviet Union); the Council then adjourned. For the record of the

                            crisis. For the last three weeks I have been wanting to write to you.
                            Your most kind letter of February 10<note n="2" xml:id="d110fn2"><ref

                            find that much I had already put on paper still represents my steadily
                            growing theme. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> and I, who
                            have composed this message together, wish to do our utmost to sustain
                            you and help you lead world opinion. There is wide recognition of the
                            efforts you have made to keep out of war with China in spite of gross
                            provocation. As you know, I feel strongly that it is a matter of honour
                            for the United States not to allow <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> and his adherents, with whom the United States
                            have worked as allies for so many years, to be liquidated and massacred
                            by Communist China, who are alleged to have already executed in cold
                            blood between two and three millions of their opponents in their civil
                            war. Our feeling is that this is the prime and vital point. According to
                            our lights we feel that this could and should be disentangled from
                            holding the off-shore islands as bridgeheads for a Nationalist invasion
                            of Communist China. Besides this we do not think that Formosa itself,
                            while protected by the United States, ought to wage sporadic war against
                            the mainland.</p>

                            <item>So the problem before us at this stage centres on what should be
                                done about the off-shore islands, which we here have to admit are
                                legally part of China and which nobody here considers a just cause
                                of war. You know how hard <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                    >Anthony</persName> and I have tried to keep in step with you
                                and how much we wish to continue to do so. But a war to keep the
                                coastal islands for <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                                would not be defensible here.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>I had understood that the United States Government had so far been
                                resolved to resist <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s
                                pressure to give assurances about these islands, even in return for
                                Chinese Nationalist evacuation of the Tachens, and had succeeded in
                                doing so. I hope your last sentence on page 2<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d110fn3">The sentence reads: “The morale of the Chinese
                                    Nationalists is important to us, so for the moment, and under
                                    existing conditions, we feel they must have certain assurances
                                    with respect to the offshore islands.”</note> does not conflict
                                with this.</item>

                            <item>I cannot see any decisive relationship between the offshore
                                islands and an invasion of Formosa. It would surely be quite easy
                                for the United States to drown any Chinese would-be invaders of
                                Formosa whether they started from Quemoy or elsewhere. If ever there
                                was an operation which may be deemed impossible it would be the
                                passage of about a hundred miles of sea in the teeth of overwhelming
                                naval and air superiority and without any tank and other special
                                landing-craft. You and I have already studied and indeed lived
                                through such a problem both ways.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Guessing at the other side’s intentions is, as you say, often
                                difficult. In this case of Quemoy, etc., the Communists have an
                                obvious national and military purpose, namely, to get rid of a
                                bridgehead admirably suited to the invasion of the mainland of
                                China. This seems simple.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>Diplomatically their motives are more fanciful. It may be, as your
                                third paragraph suggests, that the absurd Chinese boastings about
                                invading Formosa are inspired by the Soviet desire to cause division
                                between the Allies in the far more important issues which confront
                                us in Europe. It costs very little to say, as the Chinese are now
                                reported to be doing, that “the possession of the Tachens will help
                                the liberation of Formosa”. It adds to the pretence of Communist
                                China’s might and is intended to provoke the United States into
                                actions and declarations which would embarrass many of us, and add
                                influence to Communist propaganda.</item>

                            <item>I have already expressed my convictions about your duty to

                                called your “brave ally”. But I do not think it would be right or
                                wise for America to encourage him to keep alive the reconquest of
                                the mainland in order to inspirit his faithful followers. He
                                deserves the protection of your shield but not the use of your

                                    detachment elsewhere on the off-shore coastline were being
                                    scuppered. To me at this distance the plan seems to have the
                                    merit of being simple, clear, and above all, resolute. It would,
                                    I believe, command a firm majority of support over here. It puts
                                    an end to a state of affairs where unforeseeable or
                                    unpreventable incidents and growing exasperation may bring about

                            <item>To sum up, we feel that the coastal islands must not be used as
                                stepping stones either by the Communists towards the conquest of
                                Formosa or the Nationalists towards the conquest of China. But they
                                might all too easily become the occasion of an incident which would
                                place the United States before the dilemma of either standing by
                                while their allies were butchered or becoming embroiled in a war for
                                no strategic or political purpose.</item>

                            <item>If this is so, the right course must be to make sure that the

                                decision over the coastal islands. This can only be done by taking
                                advantage of the present lull to remove the Nationalists from Quemoy
                                and the Matsus—as they have already been removed from the
                                Tachens—before they become the occasion of further dangers. Opinion
                                in this country, and so far as can be judged in the Commonwealth,
                                would regard such a decision as right in law, in morals and in

                            <item>Chinese Communist propaganda and diplomatic representations
                                demonstrate that the regime is strongly committed to the
                                “liberation” of Formosa, the Pescadores, and the offshore islands.
                                The Chinese Communist leaders give every indication of holding to
                                this position. Moreover, Peiping has long regarded the continued
                                presence in the Formosa Strait and on Formosa itself of a
                                Nationalist China supported militarily by the US as at least a

                            <item>We believe that the Chinese Communists will refrain from courses
                                of action which they estimate will involve them in full-scale
                                warfare with the United States.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>However, we believe that the Chinese Communist attitude with
                                respect to war is bold, sometimes boisterous, sometimes
                                sophisticated, and that the Chinese Communists are therefore likely
                                to test the upper limits of US tolerance with a variety of
                                substantial military actions. Moreover, in the light of Chinese
                                Communist activities in recent months and their reactions to the
                                recent US policy pronouncements on the defense of Formosa and the
                                Pescadores, we are not confident that the Chinese Communists clearly
                                understand which, if any,<note n="4" xml:id="d111fn4">The Deputy

                                which the defense would be carried. We believe, therefore, that the
                                Chinese Communists may miscalculate the degree of risk which
                                military actions on their part in this area would entail.</item>

                                not be convinced, in the light of the restraint exercised by US
                                policy in Korea and Indochina, that the US would in fact react to
                                attacks on the offshore islands by attacks on the mainland. Or, they
                                may believe that the scale of any US reaction, even if it involved
                                some attacks against the mainland, could be controlled by them,
                                perhaps by diplomatic action at a critical juncture, in which they
                                would count heavily on the restraining influence of US allies on US
                                policy. Finally, they may believe that <pb n="275" xml:id="pg_275"

                                general war, and will try to avoid courses of action which in their
                                judgment would clearly involve substantial risk of general war. We
                                believe that the recent changes in Soviet leadership do not indicate
                                any increased disposition on the part of the regime to risk such a

                                in clashes between Chinese Communist and US forces, at least as long
                                as it believed that the clashes would be limited and localized. Both
                                Soviet and Chinese Communist leaders probably estimate that strictly
                                local conflict between the Chinese Communists and the US, with the
                                accompanying increase of international tensions, would serve their
                                interests. They may estimate, for example, that the US in these
                                circumstances would not have the support of its allies or of world
                                opinion in a defense of the offshore islands, and that the result
                                would be an increasing isolation of the US. Under these
                                circumstances they might believe that US progress toward its
                                objectives elsewhere, including West German rearmament, would be
                                impeded, and that Soviet aims would thereby be served.</item>

                            <item><p>However, the Kremlin would almost certainly be concerned that
                                    military conflict between the US and Communist China could not
                                    be kept limited and localized. It would almost certainly
                                    estimate that unlimited war between the US and Communist China
                                    not only would endanger the existence of the principal ally of
                                    the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, but also would
                                    involve substantial risk of spreading into general war. Hence,
                                    it would probably attempt to exert a restraining influence if it
                                    judged that appreciable danger of unlimited war between the US
                                    and Communist China were developing. If such war did occur, we
                                    believe that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would
                                    support its ally in carrying on the war, but would not assist
                                    with its own forces to such an extent as, in its judgment, would
                                    cause the US to attack targets in Soviet territory. We believe
                                    that the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would openly
                                    intervene in the war if the Soviet leaders considered such
                                    intervention necessary to save the Chinese Communist regime, but
                                    the Soviet leaders would still try to confine the area of
                                    hostilities to the Far East.<note n="7" xml:id="d111fn7"><p>The
                                            Director of Naval Intelligence and the Deputy Director
                                            for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, believe that the
                                            following should be substituted for the last
                                            sentence:</p>
                                        <p>“Should the conflict progress so far that destruction of
                                            the Chinese Communist regime appeared imminent, we
                                            believe that the Soviet leaders would recognize that
                                            open intervention on their part against US forces
                                            sufficient to save the Chinese regime would involve
                                            grave risk of general war with the US. Their decision
                                            would probably be based on existing military, political,
                                            and economic strengths, with particular emphasis on the
                                            current disparities in nuclear stockpiles and delivery
                                            capabilities. We believe that the Soviet leaders would
                                            probably conclude that if they intervened, the conflict
                                            could not be confined to the Far East, and that Soviet
                                            strengths were insufficient to risk their own regime in
                                            this manner.” [Footnote in the source

                        <p>Pres. thought of one question he might ask: “What position would you

                                    lines. I told him that I had broached this matter with <persName

                            he should get an understanding of our own political situation, at home

                            so that they always have 75 pilots to man them. He persists in looking
                            at it as a civil war, &amp; not as a war against Communism; he wants us
                            to recognize it as civil war &amp; to get in on his side. Pres. thinks
                            that if we could get understanding between him &amp; ourselves on the
                            world politically, then we could be very, very strong on the rest of it,
                            on which <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1">Winston</persName> will go along

                        <p>On February 16, Secretary of State <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> gave an address entitled “Our Foreign Policies in
                            Asia” before the Foreign Policy Association in New York City. The
                            portion of the address concerning Formosa and the offshore islands reads
                            in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is important to note that the treaty [the Mutual Defense
                                    Treaty with the Republic of China], except as it relates to
                                    United States territories, covers only the islands of Formosa
                                    and the Pescadores, and an armed attack directed against those
                                    islands. The congressional authority is to secure and protect
                                    Formosa and the Pescadores against armed attack, and to make
                                    secure and to protect ‘related positions and territories’ as the
                                    President judges this would be ‘required or appropriate in
                                    assuring the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.’</p>
                                <p>“The President did not use our Armed Forces to help the Chinese
                                    Nationalists to hold the Tachen Islands and Yushan and Pishan,
                                    lying some 200 miles north of Formosa. These islands were
                                    virtually unrelated to the defense of Formosa and the
                                    Pescadores. We helped the Chinese Nationalists to evacuate these
                                    islands and regroup their forces, so as to avoid a bloody and
                                    wasteful battle which would have <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279"
                                        facs="0307"/>inflamed public emotions. Thus, Nationalist
                                    China and the United States have made an important contribution
                                    to the cause of peace.</p>
                                <p>“It has been suggested that Nationalist China should go further
                                    and surrender to the Chinese Communists the coastal positions
                                    which the Communists need to stage their announced attack on
                                    Formosa. It is doubtful that this would serve either the cause
                                    of peace or the cause of freedom.</p>
                                <p>“The Chinese Communists have been the initiators of violence in
                                    this area. They have already formally declared their intention
                                    to take Formosa by force. If the Chinese Nationalists now oblige
                                    by making it easier for the Chinese Communists to conquer
                                    Formosa, will they be less apt to do so? I doubt it.</p>
                                <p>“The United States has no commitment and no purpose to defend the
                                    coastal positions as such. The basic purpose is to assure that
                                    Formosa and the Pescadores will not be forcibly taken over by
                                    the Chinese Communists. However, Foreign Minister <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> says they will use all
                                    their force to take Formosa, and they treat the coastal islands
                                    as means to that end. When the Nationalists voluntarily
                                    evacuated the Tachen Islands, the Chinese Communists’ comment
                                    was: The liberation of these islands has created favorable
                                    conditions for our People’s Liberation Army in the liberation of
                                    Formosa.’</p>
                                <p>“Thus the Chinese Communists have linked the coastal positions to
                                    the defense of Formosa. That is the fact which, as President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> said in
                                    his message to Congress about Formosa, ‘compels us to take into
                                    account closely related localities.’ Accordingly, we shall be
                                    alert to subsequent Chinese Communist actions, rejecting for
                                    ourselves any initiative of warlike deeds.</p>
                                <p>“It is hardly to be expected that the Chinese Communists will
                                    renounce their ambitions. However, might they not renounce their
                                    efforts to realize their goals by force?</p>
                                <p>“Such renunciation of force is one of the basic principles of the
                                    United Nations, and the United States had hoped, and still
                                    hopes, that the United Nations may be able to effect a cessation
                                    of the present hostilities.”</p>

                            situation in the offshore islands. He indicated there was tacit
                            agreement among them to try to get the U.S. to persuade the Nationalists
                            to withdraw from the offshore islands to Formosa. Secretary <persName

                            no realization among the Commonwealth Prime Ministers of the difficulty

                            all of us agreed with them as to how fortunate it would be if these
                            islands sank to the bottom of the sea; but, he added, they do not
                            recognize what we have already done in an attempt to bring about peace

                                amount to a public commitment. Such a statement would force him to

                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s concern, the Secretary
                            replaced his wording with that taken from the President’s message to
                            Congress, in an attempt to reassure the British that he did not intend
                            to go beyond the commitments contained in the Congressional message.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that Mr.
                            Dixon in New York had told him that the British Government appreciated
                            the changes which he had made, and believed that both governments should
                            seek to avoid differences on the Formosa policy. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> appeared to be more sympathetic
                            to our position after Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had explained again to him the various actions
                            the United States had taken to get the situation under control in the
                            Formosa Straits, including the promise of <persName>Chiang</persName> to
                            take no action against the mainland even from the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> briefed the
                            Council on the military situation in the Formosa area. He began by
                            saying that the Joint Chiefs were watching with great interest all
                            developments at airports in Fukien Province. Three U.S. photo
                            reconnaissance planes had been given <persName>Chiang</persName> in
                            order to obtain current information about this area on the mainland.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> added that if
                            our commanders were unable to get information satisfactory to them by
                            this means, they would put U.S. reconnaissance planes over this
                            area.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated that
                            the Chinese Communists would reveal their intentions to attack Quemoy
                            and the Matsus if they moved their air force to fields in Fukien. He
                            estimated that the Communists might attack the islands separately, or
                            attack all of them at once. He said he was faced with the serious
                            problem of replacing aircraft lost in combat, especially jet planes,
                            which had been given to <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282" facs="0310"/>the
                            Chinese Nationalists for the defense of the offshore islands. He
                            reported that the Chinese Nationalists were now holding the Matsus and
                            the Quemoys and Nanchi, the latter being the most northern outpost now
                            held by the Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> interrupted to
                            state that <persName>Chiang</persName> had been told that the United
                            States would not help to defend Nanchi.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked whether
                            there was any military value in holding Nanchi. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> responded that Nanchi did
                            provide a radar location and it was now the most northern outpost of
                            Formosa. He added that it was held by a small garrison, and that its
                            loss would not be comparable to that of the Quemoys or the Matsus
                            because there was very little U.S. equipment on the island. The Chinese
                            Nationalists, he added, state that they cannot withdraw from Nanchi
                            without serious loss of morale. <persName>Chiang</persName> has taken
                            the position, he added, that he will not voluntarily withdraw from any
                            other island he now holds.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            everyone agreed that the Chinese Nationalists cannot hold Nanchi against
                            a Communist attack. If this is so, is it not dangerous to the U.S. to
                            face such a defeat?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that it
                            was necessary to balance the psychological disadvantage of losing Nanchi
                            against the gain to the Nationalists if they put up a good fight. He
                            added that the Chinese Nationalists believed that the demonstration of
                            their willingness to fight for Nanchi was worth the possible loss of the
                            island. He said that if the United States tried to persuade
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> to withdraw from Nanchi, we would have
                            to stiffen other commitments. He believed we should allow them to go
                            their own way as regards Nanchi. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> said he agreed.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> noted that if the
                            Nationalists fought and lost Nanchi, this would be bad for the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President admitted that the loss of Nanchi would be bad, but asked
                            what was the alternative.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> asked when did
                            Nanchi get separated out from the Tachen grouping. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that Nanchi had always
                            been considered separate from the Tachens. He continued by calling
                            attention to the inability of the military to stay within the programmed
                            limitation on the replacement of U.S. equipment lost by the Nationalists
                            in current fighting. He said adequate funds were available and that the
                            real problem was to get airplanes into the theater quickly enough. (In
                            response to a question asked by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_FAS1"
                                >Flemming</persName> later in the discussion, Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that his problem was
                            not one of producing planes or parts, but of delivering the craft to the
                            bases from which they were flown.)</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> urged that the
                            United States make known its position on Nanchi.</p>
                        <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0311"/>
                        <p>The President stated that everyone knew the U.S. was committed to defend
                            Formosa and the Pescadores. The question of the offshore islands created
                            a terrible dilemma. If we announced that we would assist in the defense
                            of the offshore islands, world opinion would not support us. On the
                            other hand, if we announced that we would not assist in the defense of
                            these islands, the Communists would immediately attack them and take
                            them. The President stated his belief that there was nothing more that
                            we could now do except to watch the situation as it develops and act on
                            a day-to-day basis.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he was
                            concerned about the possibility of an awkward situation developing in
                            Formosa. If the Communists attacked Formosa, military action would have
                            to be taken very fast. Because we do not know the Communist intentions,
                            we face an uncertain situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> policy was clear as to our
                            intention to defend Formosa and the Pescadores, and that we had made a
                            public announcement to that effect. He recalled that the President had
                            decided to retain to himself the decision as to when U.S. forces would
                            be used, rather than delegate this decision to anyone. He said he
                            realized the difficult situation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> again raised
                            the question of Nanchi, and urged that this island could be considered
                            separately—not the same as the Quemoys and the Matsus.</p>
                        <p>The President stated firmly that we must do our desperate best to avoid
                            committing U.S. troops in this area. He added that we should build up
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> in every possible way to defend the
                            area. If the Chinese Communists attack Formosa, the President decides
                            when U.S. units get into the fight. No more public statements will do
                            any good now. In addition, the Nanchi decision isn’t ours to make.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> asked whether
                            we should not guide the Nationalists’ decision.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he was
                            looking at his Far Eastern itinerary to see whether it would be possible
                            for him to visit Formosa. If so, he would talk to
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> about Nanchi. However, we assume great
                            responsibility if <persName>Chiang</persName> withdraws from Nanchi in
                            response to our coercion. We did not force the withdrawal from the
                            Tachens, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> added,
                            but merely gave counsel and advice when they raised the question of
                            whether they should withdraw from the Tachens. He said it is one thing
                            to give advice, but beyond that, bargaining for additional commitments
                            begins.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that in
                            his opinion it was not realistic to think of the loss of Nanchi as a
                            defeat for Nationalist China. It is a defeat for the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President said he disagreed. He pointed out that we have
                            disassociated ourselves from certain actions which
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> may take.</p>
                        <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0312"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that Nanchi
                            is not essential to the defense of Formosa, and that the same arguments
                            apply to it as applied to the Tachens.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated his belief that the U.S. should increase
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>’s ability to fight as much as we can,
                            including the provision of logistic support.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> recalled that in
                            negotiations with <persName>Chiang</persName> the U.S. had asked him not
                            to weaken Formosa by taking a disproportionate amount of U.S. equipment
                            to the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>The President smilingly commented on the difficulty of trying to carry
                            out U.S. policy when we were in the hands of “a fellow who hasn’t
                            anything to lose”.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said the world
                            assumes that Nationalist forces can be safely evacuated from Nanchi.</p>
                        <p>The President recalled that <persName>Chiang</persName> had said he would
                            not retreat another foot. The President repeated that now was no time
                            for any more talk, because we have stated all we can now state.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> recalled that at
                            the Denver Council meeting on the subject of the offshore islands, it
                            had been stated that actions in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            might help us out. He wanted to know whether any help from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was now possible. The President and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> could not help us in this current
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The President added that the world was solidly behind the United States
                            as far as the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores was concerned.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said the U.S.
                            had to get the Chinese Nationalists off the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>The President said we cannot get the Nationalists off these islands in a
                            way which results in Formosa going Communist.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that the
                            Communists were not interested in the offshore islands, but they sought
                            to destroy the strong Nationalist forces on the islands and on
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The President agreed, and added that if he were a Chinese Nationalist
                                [<hi rend="italic">Communist</hi>] he would build up airfields
                            opposite Formosa on the mainland and attack Formosa at night. He would
                            not waste men and equipment in trying to take the Quemoys and the
                            Matsus.</p>
                        <p>The President was asked whether an attack by the Communists on Formosa
                            meant that the U.S. was “at war” with the Communists. He replied yes,
                            but this meant an attack, not one night’s foray and more than a casual
                            bombing attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that even
                            if the Nationalists gave up the Quemoys and the Matsus, the problem of
                            Formosa would not be solved. He added that the Communists were worried
                            by the Nationalist Army on Formosa, which was a threat to the middle of
                            their coastal area. He said the Communists wanted to destroy a rival and
                            to disband the present government on Formosa. He added that the <pb
                                n="285" xml:id="pg_285" facs="0313"/>British and the Canadians did
                            not agree with this view of the Communist objective, but that they were
                            wrong on this point.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out that the surrender of the offshore islands
                            would result in the collapse of <persName>Chiang</persName>’s
                            government.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> again returned
                            to the question of Nanchi, and repeated his request that this island not
                            be included in policy covering the Quemoys and the Matsus. He said the
                            situation in Nanchi was identical with that in the Tachens, and that to
                            evacuate Nanchi would not give the impression of our running off and
                            leaving an ally in trouble.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought that he would send Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> to talk to
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>, since practically everyone else had
                            been to Formosa. Following the laughter, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he would keep quiet under
                            that kind of a threat.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that when
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> loses Nanchi he will be easier to deal
                            with. The President doubted this, adding that we are always wrong when
                            we believe that Orientals think logically as we do. He cited the mule
                            who walked into the brick wall. He said that face was all-important, and
                            that Orientals would rather lose everything than lose face. He added
                            that he had learned that the only way to deal with Orientals was on an
                            empirical day-to-day basis.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked what had
                            been our advice concerning Nanchi. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that we had told them we would not help
                            defend Nanchi, and that it would be difficult for them to hold it.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> referred to
                            Nanchi again, and said that this island presented us with a serious
                            difficulty. It was a “tag end” which would rise up to plague us.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary remarked that Operation <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>
                            should not be discontinued merely because the Chinese Communists would
                            not appear in the Security Council. This would make things all too easy
                            for the Communists. The Secretary felt we should maintain the pressure
                            on them, not necessarily by voting on the tripartite draft
                                resolution,<note n="2" xml:id="d116fn2">See <ref target="#d42fn5"
                                    >footnote 5, Document 42</ref>.</note> but in any event by
                            tabling it. The prestige of both the New Zealand Government and the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was involved. The Security Council
                            operation should not be pushed to a point where it would become
                            unproductive or break down, but a slight but steady pressure should be
                            maintained.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary noted that tabling a resolution, perhaps the latter part of
                            next week, would help to meet speculation regarding what we had in mind
                            by crystallizing our intentions. He thought the resolution might
                            possibly be modified by leaving out specific reference to the People’s
                            Republic of China and the Republic of China, so that the first paragraph
                            would read: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Having noted the occurrence of armed hostilities [between the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WDW1">Wainhouse</persName> asked whether it
                            would be desirable to add a new paragraph referring to the Chinese
                            Communist refusal to accept the Security Council’s invitation. The
                            Secretary did not think it would be helpful, and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> agreed.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had not been aware of these Chinese Nationalist
                            views. He had been thinking in terms of the reaction of the Chinese
                            Communists. Clearly the concept of “two Chinas” was equally repugnant to
                            both. The point was not terribly important, however, because this
                            resolution would very probably never come into force. At the moment the
                            point was that the three governments should not allow themselves to be
                            so quickly and easily diverted from their purpose by the refusal of the
                            Chinese Communists to attend.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>The Secretary doubted that we would feel it wise to take the question to
                            the General Assembly. The subject was so complicated and delicate, and
                            the Assembly so unwieldy and so difficult to manage, that we would be
                            reluctant to raise the matter there. The Secretary suspected that some
                            other state might bring it up at the next regular session but did not
                            envisage our pressing for Assembly action in the near future.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert Scott</persName> stated that he
                            was not sure his Government would favor early resumption of Security
                            Council proceedings. With reference to the text of the resolution, he
                            asked what was the purpose of the penultimate paragraph recommending
                            “resort to peaceful methods in order to prevent the recurrence of …<note

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> pointed out that the
                            language referred to the injunction upon the parties to a dispute, in
                            Article 33 of the Charter, to seek a peaceful settlement by various
                            methods. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> thought <pb
                                n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"/>the clause was open to all
                            sorts of interpretations. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSL1"
                                >Munro</persName> thought its retention would be in accord with the
                            general tenor of the debate in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked why the United Kingdom tended to feel the matter
                            should be dropped in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said that, while he
                            was speaking without instructions, he thought his Government would not
                            feel the matter should be dropped, because that would leave the Russians
                            free to push their own item. However, he wondered what would happen
                            after the tripartite resolution was vetoed. He thought his Government
                            would prefer to see the views of the various parties clarified in the
                            diplomatic discussions now going on all over the world. Meanwhile a
                            military lull might set in. In time some kind of conciliation machinery
                            might be established, possibly through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            procedures. The alternative possibility would be that if fighting broke
                            out, and if the resolution had been voted upon, those who had supported
                            it would be jockeyed into a position where morally, though not legally,
                            they would be committed to support <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that recent intelligence estimates led him to believe
                            we would be operating under an illusion if we thought the Chinese
                            Communists had any objective except to capture Formosa. The idea that a
                            solution was possible in terms of the coastal positions seemed to him
                            incorrect. He believed the Chinese Communists’ objective was to get rid
                            of a rival Chinese Government whose existence would be awkward for them
                            if they engaged in hostilities, say in South East Asia or Korea. The
                            Secretary did not think the Chinese Communists expected to take Formosa
                            by military means alone, but mentioned the possibility that they might
                            first undertake subversive operations to bring about defections in an
                            exposed area, and then launch military operations in that area. In sum,
                            he was inclined to think that the real problem was the security of
                            Formosa itself. The offshore islands were important because of the
                            effect their loss would have on Chinese Nationalist morale. We had to
                            remember that the political stability of Formosa could conceivably be
                            impaired.</p>
                        <p>In reply to a question from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSL1"
                                >Munro</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> explained that there were differing reports on
                            the state of morale on Formosa. On the one hand there was a sense of
                            relief as a result of recent developments. On the other, there was the
                            possibility that in the future <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> would progressively lose face; that dissidents
                            might be encouraged by unfavorable developments; and that the <persName

                            training and Russian wife, might be one of them. On the basis of his own
                            contact with <persName corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> did not agree with
                            this estimate of him. He did believe, however, that it was possible the
                            Chinese Nationalists might conceivably be pushed to a point <pb n="289"
                                xml:id="pg_289" facs="0317"/>where a collapse might occur. This
                            would confront us with most crucial decisions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert Scott</persName> admitted that
                            Chinese Nationalist morale might indeed be threatened but reached a
                            different conclusion: namely, that the current American position on the
                            offshore islands would give the Chinese Communists an opportunity to
                            destroy that morale through the capture of successive island
                            outposts.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked his visitors to inform their Foreign Ministers of the
                            discussion, since he would want to consider further steps with the

                            and solidarity. Likewise we have learned from west [<hi rend="italic"
                                >western</hi>] diplomats who attended Chinese celebration that
                            Russian toasts and remarks <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0318"/>were
                            careful to avoid any mention of Formosan issue. It might be noted in
                            this connection that neither <persName corresp="#p_KNS1"
                                >Khrushchev</persName> nor Voroshilov, titular head of state,
                            attended reception. Specific reference to obligations under 1950 treaty
                            was noticeably avoided in Soviet statement and comment.</p>
                        <p>There has been, if anything, a drop-off recently in attention given in
                            Soviet press to Formosan issue. Your New York speech briefly carried
                            today in Tass despatch from New York with emphasis on determination of
                            US to defend “with its Armed Forces” not only Formosa and Pescadores but
                            “positions and territories connected therewith”, but with no direct
                            comment as yet. There is thus nothing that I have seen recently which
                            would make any clearer real Soviet intentions in regard to Formosan
                            issue and particularly the vital question of what action, if any, they
                            would take in event of hostilities between US and <gloss
                                target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>. Soviets continue to choose their words
                            with extreme care and to avoid any implication that they would regard
                            1950 treaty as operative in event of hostilities. On the other hand they
                            are giving full moral, political and psychological support to current
                            Chinese Communist campaign on Formosa and are faithfully backing all
                                <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> public positions. Soviets are
                            following developments with closest attention and their irritation with
                            British attitude is apparent and was probably cause of <persName

                            developments, it would appear that Soviets may well have agreed to

                            to direct Soviet involvement. It is possible that the concessions to

                            conceivable that Malenkov and his supporters viewed with some concern

                            I am reasonably convinced that they do not lightly regard possibility of

                            position is in itself risky and may dangerously encourage Chinese.</p>

                        <p>Dear <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1">Winston</persName>: I greatly
                            appreciate the message from you and <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Anthony</persName>.<note n="2" xml:id="d119fn2">Delivered on
                                February 15; see <ref target="#d110">Document 110</ref>.</note> I
                            have studied it long and carefully, as has <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Foster</persName>. Quite naturally, it distresses us whenever we
                            find ourselves in even partial disagreement with the conclusions that
                            you two may reach on any important subject. It is probable that these
                            differences frequently reflect dissimilar psychological and political
                            situations in our two countries more than they do differences in
                            personal convictions based upon theoretical analysis. Nevertheless we
                            clearly recognize the great importance to the security of the free world
                            of our two governments achieving a step by step progress both in policy
                            and in action.</p>
                        <p>Diplomatically it would indeed be a great relief to us if the line
                            between the Nationalists and the Communists was actually the broad
                            Strait of Formosa instead of the narrow Straits between Quemoy and Matsu
                            and the mainland. However, there are about 55,000 of the Nationalist
                            troops on these coastal islands and the problem created thereby cannot,
                            I fear, be solved by us merely announcing a desire to transplant them to
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster</persName> and I have been working
                            very hard over recent months, and he has been in close touch with
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName>, in the attempt to
                            lay a <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0321"/>basis for what we have
                            hoped may prove a gradual but steady solution.</p>
                        <p>There are two important points that must be considered at every step of
                            any analysis of this exceedingly difficult situation. The first is that
                            this country does not have decisive power in respect of the offshore
                            islands. We believe that <persName>Chiang</persName> would even choose
                            to stand alone and die if we should attempt now to coerce him into the
                            abandonment of those islands. Possibly we may convince him in the future
                            of the wisdom of this course, but to attempt to do more at this time
                            would bring us to the second major point, which is: We must not lose
                                <persName>Chiang</persName>’s army and we must maintain its
                            strength, efficiency and morale. Only a few months back we had both
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> and a strong, well-equipped French Army
                            to support the free world’s position in Southeast Asia. The French are
                            gone—making it clearer than ever that we cannot afford the loss of
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> unless all of us are to get completely
                            out of that corner of the globe. This is unthinkable to us—I feel it
                            must be to you.</p>
                        <p>In order to make an express or tacit cease-fire likely, we have, with
                            difficulties perhaps greater than you realize, done, through our
                            diplomacy, many things.</p>

                            <item>We rounded out the far Pacific security chain by a Treaty with the
                                Nationalists which, however, only covered specifically Formosa and
                                the Pescadores, thus making it clear to <persName>Chiang</persName>
                                and to all the world that we were not prepared to defend the coastal
                                positions as Treaty territory.</item>

                                refer to as the use of these offshore islands as “bridgeheads for a
                                Nationalist invasion of Communist China”, or as a base for “sporadic
                                war against the mainland” or “the invasion of the mainland of
                                China”. Under present practice we do not give agreement to any such
                                attacks unless they are retaliatory to related, prior, Communist
                                attacks. In these respects we have done much more than seems
                                generally realized.</item>

                            <item>Furthermore, we obtained an agreement from the Nationalists
                                closely limiting their right to take away from Formosa military
                                elements, material or human, to which we had contributed if this

                            <item>Finally, we secured the acquiescence of the Chinese Nationalists
                                to United Nations proceedings for a cease-fire, although the Chinese
                                Nationalists were extremely suspicious of this move and felt that it
                                could permanently blight their hopes.</item>

                        <pb n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0322"/>
                        <p>All of this was done, as I say, in consultation between <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Anthony</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Foster</persName> and in the hope that this would provide a basis
                            for a cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>However, what we have done has apparently been interpreted by the Chinese
                            Communists merely as a sign of weakness. They have intensified their
                            threats against Formosa and their expressions of determination to take
                            it by force. Also, they continue to hold, in durance vile, our airmen
                            who were captured by them in the Korean War and who should have been
                            freed by the Korean Armistice.</p>
                        <p>There comes a point where constantly giving in only encourages further
                            belligerency. I think we must be careful not to pass that point in our
                            dealings with Communist China. In such a case, further retreat becomes
                            worse than a Munich because at Munich there were at least promises on
                            the part of the aggressor to cease expansion and to keep the peace. In
                            this case the Chinese Communists have promised nothing and have not
                            contributed one iota toward peace in the Formosa area. Indeed, they
                            treat the suggestion of peace there as an insult.</p>
                        <p>I am increasingly led to feel it would be dangerous to predicate our
                            thinking and planning on the assumption that when the Chinese Communists
                            talk about their resolve to take Formosa, this is just “talk,” and that
                            they really would be satisfied with the coastal islands. I suspect that
                            it is the other way around. What they are really interested in is
                            Formosa—and later on Japan—and the coastal islands are marginal. They do
                            not want to have another Chinese Government in their neighborhood,
                            particularly one which has military power and which poses a threat to
                            their center if ever they attack on their flanks.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I think that if the Chinese Nationalists got out of Quemoy and
                            the Matsus, they would not be solving the real problem, which is far
                            more basic. I repeat that it would more likely mean that this retreat,
                            and the coercion we would have to exert to bring it about, would so
                            undermine the morale and the loyalty of the non-Communist forces on
                            Formosa that they could not be counted on. Some, at least, might defect
                            to the Communists or provide such a weak element in the defense of
                            Formosa that an amphibious operation could give the Communists a strong
                            foothold on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>You speak about our capacity to “drown” anybody who tried to cross the
                            Formosa Straits. However, we do not and cannot maintain at that spot at
                            all times sufficient force to cope with an attack which might come at
                            any time both by sea and by air and which would presumably operate from
                            several different points and be directed against several different
                            points on what is a very considerable body of land. It took us two days
                            to assemble the force necessary to insure the safety of the Chinese
                            Nationalists evacuating from the Tachens. Now most of that force has
                            returned to its normal bases which are <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295"
                                facs="0323"/>the Philippines, Japan, and Okinawa. The Chinese are
                            past masters at the art of camouflage and, as bitter experience in Korea
                            taught us, they can strike in force without detectable preparations. We
                            must rely upon a loyal and dependable force of Nationalists on Formosa
                            to deal with any who, for the reasons indicated, we might be unable to
                            “drown” before the attackers reached that island.</p>
                        <p>And if perchance there should be any serious defection on Formosa, that
                            would be a situation which we could not possibly meet by landing Marines
                            or the like to fight the Chinese Nationalist defectors on the Island.
                            Such a development would undermine the whole situation.</p>
                        <p>All of the non-Communist nations of the Western Pacific—particularly
                            Korea, Japan, the Philippines, and, of course, Formosa itself, are
                            watching nervously to see what we do next. I fear that, if we appear
                            strong and coercive only toward our friends, and should attempt to
                            compel <persName>Chiang</persName> to make further retreats, the
                            conclusion of these Asian peoples will be that they had better plan to
                            make the best terms they can with the Communists.</p>
                        <p>… But this is a situation which we have worked with and lived with very
                            intimately. We do have considerable knowledge, and the responsibility.
                            Surely all that we have done not only here, but in Korea with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, amply demonstrates that we are not
                            careless in letting others get us into a major war. I devoutly hope that
                            there may be enough trust and confidence develop between our two peoples
                            so that when judgments of this kind have to be made, each could, in the
                            last analysis, trust the other in the areas where they have special
                            knowledge and the greatest responsibility.</p>
                        <p>It would surely not be popular in this country if we became involved in
                            possible hostilities on account of Hong Kong or Malaya, which our people
                            look upon as “colonies”—which to us is a naughty word. Nevertheless, I
                            do not doubt that, if the issue were ever framed in this way, we would
                            be at your side.</p>
                        <p>We are doing everything possible to work this situation out in a way
                            which, on the one hand, will avoid the risk of war, and, on the other
                            hand, preserve the non-Communist position in the Western Pacific, a
                            position which, by the way, is vital to Australia and New Zealand.
                            However, if the Chinese Communists are determined to have a war to gain
                            Formosa, then there will be trouble.</p>
                        <p>I see I have made this as long, and perhaps as complicated, as a
                            diplomatic note. For that I apologize!</p>
                        <p>With warm regard, As Ever, Ike.</p>

                        <p>In response to the President’s request, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGNF1">Twining</persName> reviewed the readiness of SAC
                            and the information received from certain flights.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated an interest in the possibility of controlling air
                            photography of the facilities of military significance in the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> raised the
                            question of provision of reserves of equipment as replacements for
                            operational losses for the Chinese Nationalists, indicating that funds
                            available are adequate for the purpose. The President indicated that he
                            favored provision of such reserves, and mentioned as alternative ways of
                            providing them the addition of a squadron to an air wing or the storing
                            of stocks of supplies against the day of need. The President indicated
                            that he would wish to be advised by the Secretary of State before any
                            action was taken with respect to timing or other arrangements for the
                            provision of such reserves, including informing the Chinese Nationalists
                            as to U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated he would like to see <persName>Chiang</persName>
                            make proposals on his own initiative which would ease the situation
                            concerning the off-shore islands and improve the U.S. security position
                            in the Formosa area. If he would do that, the President would be
                            inclined to provide reserves, and would seriously consider maintaining
                            U.S. forces of the order of a battalion of Marines and a squadron of
                            F-86’s on the island.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> asked for the
                            President’s view with respect to legislation to provide a house for the
                            Chairman of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. The President
                            indicated he favored such action, and suggested that the Defense

                            the Budget in the normal way.</p>

                        <p>I was impressed by the Communist program of steady build-up airfields,
                            artillery emplacements and roads which would be required to take the
                            Matsus and Quemoy islands and by the extent to which we are restraining
                            the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s from attacks which would
                            delay this build-up. If this build-up is to go on without interruption,
                            then there will soon be created a situation such that the Matsus and the
                            Quemoy islands will be indefensible in the absence of massive US
                            intervention, perhaps with atomic weapons, and Taiwan itself will be
                            much more vulnerable. We must, I think, consider allowing the
                            Nationalists to attack by air this build-up, in the absence of any
                            dependable assurance that it will not be used against Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>We have been restraining the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s
                            largely in hopes that a program of restraint would facilitate a
                            cease-fire through the United Nations. Also, because air attacks based
                            on Taiwan might lead to retaliatory attacks by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s against the Taiwan fields.
                            However, I doubt that the present one-sided policy can go on
                            indefinitely. I feel that I should be in a position to warn <persName

                            we cannot justifiably continue to deny the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s the opportunity to attack the build-up, which,
                            while perhaps in the first instance directed against the coastal

                            <item>With respect to your paragraph 3, you will recall that I mentioned
                                the desirability of stationing some additional small elements of
                                American forces on Taiwan. Naturally we hoped that this commitment
                                might come about as a result of a closer understanding between
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> and ourselves respecting the wisdom
                                of their complete or partial withdrawal from Quemoy and the Matsus.
                                You will recall also that you and I talked about certain other
                                things we might do to convince him that his best course of action
                                lay in solidifying his union with us, so as to insure preservation
                                of Formosa and the Pescadores without risking too much of his force
                                in the forward positions. I refer to our readiness to speed up his
                                air development and possibly strengthen both naval and air units
                                above presently contemplated levels.</item>

                            <item>You and I have shared the hope that the Chinese Nationalist
                                government may finally conclude that their situation would be
                                improved by withdrawing from the coastal islands and regarding
                                themselves as a force of opportunity poised and ready to move to the

                                commitments or actions elsewhere may create conditions of general

                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> along this line would have to be so

                            <item>It may be entirely illusory to hope that
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> will ever acknowledge the wisdom of
                                withdrawing from his forward positions, and I agree that the need
                                for preserving his force as a part of our security arrangements in
                                that region should not be lost sight of in our efforts to make him
                                see the great difficulties involved in the defense of the coastal
                                islands. If he is adamant on this score, then I do not see how we
                                can long continue to prevent him from using available means to
                                interfere with the build-ups obviously designed to attack his
                                positions. I agree that it would be wise to inform <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that unless we soon arrive at
                                a cease fire, we cannot much longer insist that the present policy
                                be observed which permits major Communist build up or attacks
                                without <persName>Chiang</persName> reaction. I believe that you
                                should tell him that we do not intend to blackmail
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> to compel his evacuation of Quemoy
                                and the Matsus as long as he deems their possession vital to the
                                spirit and morale of the Formosan garrison and population. On the
                                contrary we expect to continue our logistic support of
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>’s forces as long as there is no
                                mutually agreed upon or tacit cease fire. Finally, if we are
                                convinced that any attack against those islands is in fact an attack
                                against Formosa, we should not hesitate to help defeat it. Possibly
                                you should tell him too that because of the continuing build-up of
                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> forces, we cannot tell
                                when any of these emergencies might arise.</item>

                                maintenance, repair and re-supply. I merely remark at the moment
                                that in return for such things, <persName>Chiang</persName> should

                        <p>Importance Matsu and Kinmen stems from psychological as well as military
                            considerations. They are part of Gimo’s defense of Formosa. They are his
                            outposts and warning stations which block two key port areas, use of
                            which <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s probably would want in
                            any invasion attempt against Formosa. Their retention by <gloss

                            build-up by <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s for invasion of
                            Formosa and Pescadores.</p>
                        <p>More than that, however, Matsu and Kinmen offer Nationalist leadership
                            their one hope of reestablishing themselves on mainland. Regardless of
                            diverse views on this hope, it represents <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss> feelings. Should we barter away their one hope so
                            quickly, it could have serious repercussions psychologically amongst
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s and all through Far
                            East.</p>
                        <p>Geographically and militarily, loss might be inconsequential, but
                            diplomatic and psychological repercussions might be out of all
                            proportion to its physical importance. <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss> military posture on Formosa and their will to resist
                            could begin to disintegrate with resultant <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305"

                            which is so important to Free World security. It could even result in an
                            increased burden on United States if chain is to be kept intact in
                            future.</p>
                        <p>On Formosa, as on other major positions of Island Littoral, it is
                            militarily important in foreseeable future to have strong anti-Communist
                            military forces.</p>
                        <p>I am still puzzled as to what particular part of my interview gave Sec

                            “Someone—and it could be you—has got to get <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> to see several things clearly. The first of these
                            is that in holding Formosa and the Pescadores for the free world he must
                            not permit his position to become a fixed one, one which is linked
                            closely to those offshore islands. Secondly, he must realize that he is
                            in a position of great opportunity and that he must keep up his Army and
                            be ready to move if the Communists, as I expect they will sooner or
                            later, make an attack either in Korea or in Indo-China. Then <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> is in a position to attack and
                            to attack hard the center. <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0334"
                            />That’s the only way he’s ever going to get back to the mainland and
                            someone should tell him this.”</p>
                        <p>The President discussed at great length with Howard the position of
                            Quemoy and Matsu. In both instances he admitted that these islands were
                            good for defensive purposes—that Quemoy controlled the harbor of Amoy
                            and Matsu controlled the harbor of Foochow. But it would be extremely
                            difficult since they were just off the mainland to defend them against
                            an all-out Communist attack. Such an attack would endanger American
                            fleet units which would have to be moved in close to the China Mainland.
                            The President said he was not saying that we would not defend Quemoy and
                            Matsu, that he could think of many conditions where we would—but what he
                            was impressing on Howard was that <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> should not center his whole question of the
                            morale of his people on those two islands. “If he does that and loses
                            that eventually, he will be in exactly the same position as the French
                            were when they tried to defend Dienbienphu, an impossible position, and
                            then lost it. At that time we urged the French not to make a stand, that
                            it could not possibly be defended—but they paid no attention. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> must not make the same mistake”.
                            As to the position of opportunity which <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> now holds the President said that he hoped that
                            Howard, in talking to him, would try to get it around so that this idea
                            was <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s idea and not
                            Howard’s. He said that the Chinese Communists were getting arrogant and
                            were being supplied with material of war by the Russians. We, in turn,
                            are building up <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s forces,
                            are building up their air force and are giving matériel to them. The
                            President said that sooner or later he expected that the Chinese
                            Communists would move either south or north and that that was the time
                            when <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s great opportunity
                            would come. “If he keeps up the morale of his troops, if he keeps up his
                            Army, he will always be a threat to the Chinese Communists. You know
                            full well that he has 400,000 troops trained and equipped. Now, while
                            Matsu and Quemoy are defensive positions, they certainly would not be
                            used in an offensive by <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            against the Mainland. In an invasion of a mainland, you don’t land on an
                            island because if you do, you just have to get off of it and go forward.
                            When I was in command during the war, we didn’t land at Brest or
                            LeHavre; we went around to the beaches of the mainland. That is what
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> is going to have to do
                            and that is the only way he is ever going to get back to the
                            mainland.”</p>
                        <p>The President also asked Howard if he was going to stop in India. Howard
                            said he was not, that he did not particularly like <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and that he had no plans to do
                            so. The President said that was all right but if he was writing stories
                            from that area, to please not knock down the Indians too much. “After
                            all, India is a vast continent of 350 million people. If they are ever
                            added to the great populations <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0335"

                            not only in the East but throughout the world. I don’t trust <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>. He thinks he is a kingmaker. But
                            we have got to keep them at least on the neutral side if we can. So
                            please, Roy, don’t go slamming the Indians in any stories that you
                            write.” Howard promised not to do this and also promised to have a
                            series of talks with <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>, with
                            Madame <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> interpreting.</p>
                        <p>The President told Howard that if he could get <persName

                                skilled at camouflage and may be able to conceal timing. I informed

                                evidence intention take Taiwan by force and no indication
                                willingness seek possible settlement. They have done nothing
                                contribute to peaceful settlement. Thus we have reached situation
                                where line of retreat nears its end. May be from technical viewpoint
                                we are not choosing best position but further retreat would be even
                                worse. If we give up offshore islands, defense Taiwan even more
                                difficult. Further retreat would have grave effect on Taiwan and in
                                Asia. Very considerable factor in situation now is possibility of
                                deteriorating morale at Taiwan. Withdrawal from islands might have
                                critical effect on ability Chinese Nationalists hold islands if
                                morale disintegrated and groups there made deals with Communists. It
                                would be virtually impossible retain islands. US has no ground
                                troops there and is not disposed to put any in. Further retreat
                                could swing Asia. Trends in Japan are already disturbing. Further
                                retreat or loss of Formosa would convince Japan communism wave of
                                future. Consequent effect on Okinawa and other parts of Asia
                                obvious. Overseas Chinese would turn to Peking.</item>

                                <item>His only concern is over fighting for offshore islands. Most
                                    of his comments and questions revolved around disposition of
                                    Matsu and Quemoy. He reiterated his belief public opinion in
                                    Commonwealth and elsewhere does not see necessity of stirring up
                                    row over these islands and would not support our fighting for
                                    them. This is apparently difficult question for him at home as
                                    well as in Commonwealth. Secondly, he emphasized to me several
                                    times his speculation Chinese Communists will not become
                                    involved with our military power to attack Taiwan but may see
                                    advantages in embroiling US over offshore islands. Militarily
                                    they can take these islands and will ignore cost of manpower and
                                    equipment. Involving US in these islands will put US on weakest
                                    ground with its allies and public opinion generally. He also
                                    mentioned Russians would probably find this situation to their
                                    advantage. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> made it
                                    clear he did not see any necessity hold these islands and
                                    pointedly asked <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>
                                    and myself why US wants to defend them. He ended his general
                                    comments by suggesting some step be taken to seek out Peking’s
                                    real intention, to see if something could be worked out.</item>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> explained to
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> defense relationship
                            between offshore islands and Taiwan. They block launching attack on
                            Taiwan, provide advance warning and are closer to hostile area in case
                            of fighting. Field Marshal Harding interjected to differ with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>. Comparing situation to Allied
                            assault in Operation Overlord, Harding expressed opinion critical
                            question is not launching or lodging initial attack across water but in
                            being able afterwards sustain assault forces. He thought Chinese
                            Communists military leaders would advise against attack on Taiwan as
                            long as Seventh Fleet commanded sea and air. Hence he did not believe
                            possession offshore islands would have much to do with whether Chinese
                            Communists would or would not attack Taiwan. I pointed out his analysis
                            neglected critical factor of effect on morale of loss of offshore
                            islands.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s comments on offshore
                            islands led him to suggestion, which he apparently came prepared to
                            make, that something should be done to see if Chinese Communists would
                            give up their declared intentions to take Taiwan by force if certain
                            circumstances developed. He outlined vague proposal that, if Chinese
                            Communists would give assurances not to use force against Taiwan, <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would sound out US as to whether there
                            could be peaceful settlement offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>He did not know if this feasible or if Chinese Communists would even
                            consider it but thought it worth trying in case it did work. He stressed
                            point we would all be in better public and moral position if we at least
                            tried some such approach should it fail. He had not thought out channel
                            to use but was considering possibility going through <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> Chargé Peking rather than Indians.</p>
                        <p>I said his general suggestion might be worth exploring. I agreed to talk
                            with him further about it before leaving Bangkok. This was <pb n="310"
                                xml:id="pg_310" facs="0338"/>initial approach on his part and he
                            will follow it up for I am sure that he is searching for some formula
                            along above lines.</p>

                                <p>In the face of this temperate action by the US, the Chinese
                                    Communists have become more intemperate. They have made

                                    facilities to take Formosa by force; and they are making ready a
                                    circle of airfields along coast opposite Formosa.</p>
                                <p>Under the circumstances we feel that we have gone as far as is

                                    retaining their claims to Formosa, would give assurances that
                                    they would not seek a verdict by force, then situation might be
                                    different. But as matters now stand, we are compelled conclude

                                    combination of attempted invasion and internal subversion; or at
                                    least that they intend probe our intention to the point of

                                    sacrifice much manpower in this experiment.</p>

                        <p>“Dear Mr. President:</p>
                        <p>[Here follow personal remarks and a summary of developments at the <gloss
                                target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> Council meeting. This portion of
                            the telegram is scheduled for publication in the Asia regional
                            compilation in a forthcoming volume.]</p>
                        <p>Last night <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and I, each with
                            three advisers, discussed at length the Formosa situation. I read to him
                            a memo, text of which I am cabling to Department and which you may want
                            look at. It summarizes our efforts towards a peaceful solution and total
                            lack of any co-operation from Communist side. <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> asked make a copy, which I <pb
                                n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0340"/>authorized, making clear
                            however that my memo was merely my own talking paper and nothing like a
                            diplomatic note. I think he may make an effort get Chinese Communists to
                            agree not seek a violent solution of Formosa matter, and I encouraged
                            him do so, because I think that if he makes the effort and fails, he
                            will then be better able justify our position before British Parliament
                            and public. If he succeeds, so much the better.</p>
                        <p>“He believes that this effort would not be helped if we should press
                            proceedings in <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and I therefore told
                            him that we would agree to suspend for a further brief period request
                            for a cease-fire resolution so as to permit this other initiative of his
                            to have best chance of success. I said, however, that if this did not
                            succeed at some fairly early date, I felt we would want to have a
                            cease-fire resolution actually introduced and voted upon so as to make
                            even more clear our own desire for a peaceful solution and that
                            responsibility for rejecting a cease-fire rests upon Communists.</p>
                        <p>“In general, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s line was that
                            a further fall-back by abandonment of Quemoy and Matsu would be
                            justified by increased support of resultant position by Commonwealth and
                            Western European public opinion. He naturally attaches to this an
                            importance which I feel fails to appraise adequately dangers to
                            non-Communist morale in Far East, notably in Taiwan, Korea, Japan and
                            the Philippines.</p>
                        <p>“I told him that as matters now stood, while we hoped Chinese
                            Nationalists would alone be able hold remaining islands, that if they
                            failed do so and if it seemed that attack upon them was part of an
                            attack against Formosa itself, you would have to consider active US
                            intervention. I also told him that in view steady Communist build-up of
                            artillery emplacements and airfields, we had about reached a point where
                            we did not feel we could assume the moral responsibility of preventing
                            Chinese Nationalists from attempting interfere with this build-up by
                            mainland attacks against hostile positions.</p>
                        <p>“Conversation was throughout in best of spirit with mutual comprehension
                            different viewpoints and difficulty problem.</p>
                        <p>“I reminded <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that there must
                            come a time in these matters where will to stand must be made manifest.
                            In case of Hitler, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> himself
                            recognized that this had come too late. It should have come in relation
                            to Czechoslovakia rather than Poland, and if it had come earlier, there
                            might not have been the Second World War. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> agreed that there was a parallel but still seemed
                            feel that we could afford a further retreat. I said this was a grave
                            decision where you would have to exercise final responsibility and that
                            all the world could know you would do so with the sober sense of
                            responsibility and dedication to peace with freedom.</p>

                            to leave China has already been proclaimed during the Geneva Conference.
                            This policy consists in protecting foreigners who wish to leave China
                            provided such foreigners respect Chinese laws. Authorization to leave
                            China is already granted and will be granted after examination to
                            Americans who wish to leave China. But those foreigners who have
                            committed crimes are condemned according to Chinese law. This policy has
                            already been communicated to your side and has always been applied by
                            Chinese Government since Geneva Conference. Furthermore more than 10
                            Americans have already left China. Therefore your statement about the
                            opposition on your side on this subject is groundless. We cannot agree
                            on subject of the departure of Americans as our policy is clear and
                            already known to you. We do not know if there is any news concerning the
                            departure from China of the 13 American spies. Regarding exchange of
                            small packages including medicines and letters between Americans in
                            China and their families in United States through Chinese Red Cross we
                            have always applied this channel and you can always do so in the future.
                            According to American press agency reports certain members of families
                            of the 13 condemned Americans in China expressed intention to go to
                            China to visit these prisoners. If such relatives wish to go to China
                            our government is in a position to do the necessary for their
                            visas”.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName> said “This question has been
                            examined by my Government in relation to a similar offer which your side
                            made to enable relatives of American military personnel imprisoned in
                            Communist China to visit them there. My Government for the time being
                            has decided not to issue passports to any Americans to visit Red China
                            in view uncertainties created by belligerent attitude and actions of
                            Chinese Communists. The situation has not improved since that decision
                            was made. The Chinese Communists could benefit these American relatives
                            most by releasing these detained Americans.”</p>
                        <p>The Chinese answer was “To meet the wishes of relatives of condemned
                            Americans in China who wish to go to China to visit these condemned
                            persons the Chinese Government is ready to undertake the necessary
                            action to procure them visas. But the American Government is fearful
                            lest the relatives of these prisoners as well as the American people
                            will become aware of the reality of the crimes committed by these
                            condemned men and the American Government is also fearful lest these
                            relatives and the people of America get to know that the Chinese
                            Government really desires peace. Thus the American Government has
                            refused to issue passports to these relatives <pb n="318"
                                xml:id="pg_318" facs="0346"/>who wish to go to China. The
                            responsibility for this refusal rests with the American Government.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName> replied “I reject your
                            accusations against my Government. They are completely false and
                            groundless.”</p>
                        <p>The Chinese did not reply.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Comments:</hi> Chinese made no reference to their

                            listed above <persName corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName> asked how soon
                            we might expect reply. After somewhat lengthy consultation among

                        <p>General attitude Chinese side was quite relaxed, calm and not at all
                            tense. When meeting adjourned they again were first to offer handshake
                            all saying single word goodbye. We received clear impression Chinese
                            wished to stress Red Cross channels available for mail, small parcels,
                            including medicines, and that they clearly indicated without saying it,
                            further such meetings might be held here concerning our desire obtaining
                            information re welfare whereabouts detained Americans. We thought
                            Chinese statement quoted above that they do not know if there is any
                            news about departure from China of “the 13 American spies” of special
                            interest especially as it was quite unsolicited.</p>

                                    economic difficulties owing to its inability to export rice.
                                    Part of this difficulty stemmed from the fact that U.S. rice
                                    exports <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0347"/>had lately been
                                    competing with Formosan exports. The President commented that he
                                    had never imagined that the United States would get itself
                                    involved in the export of rice. Admiral <persName

                        <p>I asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCWP1">McConaughy</persName> to pass
                            the following to the Ambassador: That as you and your party would not
                            return until Sunday,<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">March 6.</note> and as
                            there had been many developments in your absence with which only you
                            were familiar, we would prefer that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1"
                                >Pearson</persName> not make the proposed statement until you had
                            returned and he had an opportunity to check it personally with you.</p>
                        <p>This morning the Ambassador called me to say that he had talked with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName>, who agreed not to
                            make the statement until next week. I promised to call it to your
                            attention soon after your return and to let the Ambassador know as soon
                            thereafter as possible of your reaction.</p>
                        <p>I also told the Ambassador that our recent intelligence indicated that
                            the Communist propaganda on Formosa and the offshore islands had
                            declined within the last few weeks to the lowest point since last
                            summer. I ventured the opinion that perhaps the Communists were, in
                            effect, adopting a tacit cease-fire rather than a formal one. If such
                            should prove to be the case, it might be better for all concerned if the
                            issue were allowed to lay dormant for a while and we do our utmost to
                            keep from stirring the issue up. The Ambassador agreed <pb n="320"
                                xml:id="pg_320" facs="0348"/>that this might well be the case, and
                            said they would watch developments closely.</p>

                        <p>I opened by asking President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> how he wished to proceed and whether he wished me
                            to speak first or whether he cared to do so. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>, interpreting for the
                            President, said that the President wished me to make the initial
                            presentation.</p>
                        <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0349"/>
                        <p>I expressed satisfaction at the bringing into force of the Mutual
                            Security Treaty<note n="7" xml:id="d138fn7">The Secretary and Foreign
                                Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> had exchanged
                                instruments of ratification earlier that day.</note> and said that
                            if it were agreeable to the President, we might treat this as the first
                            meeting of consultation under Article IV of the treaty. He agreed.</p>
                        <p>I said that I was happy that there were also present Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> who would be able to conduct
                            military conversation with the President’s military advisers. I thought
                            that there was probably a need to reconsider present planning so as to
                            put it on to a basis related to the present threat rather than upon some
                            long-term basis.</p>
                        <p>I said I wished first of all to clear up any doubts that might be in the
                            President’s mind with reference to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            proceedings. The US, as a member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, has perhaps different responsibilities from those of
                            the Republic of China. As far as the US was involved, the threat was
                            international because our defensive undertakings were challenged.
                            Therefore, the US was obliged to seek to resolve peacefully this
                            international conflict. The position of the Republic of China might be
                            different because it might regard hostilities as civil war and therefore
                            excluded from <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> competence by Article
                            2(7) dealing with domestic jurisdiction.</p>
                        <p>The US was not hopeful of a positive result and indeed we had not clearly
                            decided as to whether or when we would proceed further. We anticipated a
                            Soviet veto. However, we had a duty to ourselves and to our own public
                            opinion and indeed to world opinion to seek to invoke the peaceful
                            procedures of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>; and if there was a
                            Soviet veto, then the whole world would know where the responsibility
                            lay. I said I wished to make a second point, which was that we did not
                            seek for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> any jurisdiction with
                            respect to the territory or status of the Republic of China. What we
                            sought was simply a “cease-fire” resolution which would stop the
                            fighting, but not attempt to deal with the substance of the respective
                            claims.</p>
                        <p>I then went on to discuss the question of the defense of Quemoy and Matsu
                            Islands. I said that perhaps at the beginning of my talks with Foreign
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> there had been a
                            temporary confusion for which I was prepared to take full
                            responsibility. It was not now profitable to go into the explanation but
                            the matter had developed in the US in such a way that the authority to
                            use the Armed Forces of the US outside the treaty area had to be left to
                            the future judgment of the President of the US and that therefore there
                            could not be any actual present commitment. I said that the position was
                            I thought accurately expressed in the statement which I was prepared to
                            make on leaving Taiwan, and I asked Foreign Minister to translate <pb
                                n="322" xml:id="pg_322" facs="0350"/>to the President the relevant
                            portion (paragraphs 6 to 10) of my Taipei departure statement.<note

                                    departure from Taipei later that day. Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> announced that the first
                                    meeting of consultation under the Mutual Defense Treaty had
                                    taken place; paragraphs 6 through 10 read as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The decision as to the use of the armed forces of the United
                                    States and the scope of their use under Public Law 4 will be
                                    made by the President himself in the light of the circumstances
                                    at the time and his appraisal of the intentions of the Chinese
                                    Communists.</p>
                                <p>“Since however the Matsu and Quemoy Islands, now in friendly
                                    hands, have a relationship to the defense of Taiwan such that
                                    the President may judge their protection to be appropriate in
                                    assuring the defense of Taiwan and the Pescadores, our
                                    consultation covered also these coastal positions of the
                                    Republic of China.</p>
                                <p>“It is the ardent hope of the United States that the Chinese
                                    Communists will not insist on war as an instrument of its
                                    policy.</p>
                                <p>“As President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>
                                    said, ‘We would welcome action by the United Nations which might
                                    bring an end to the active hostilities in the area.’ The United
                                    Nations is exploring the possibility of a cease-fire, as are
                                    also other peace-loving nations.</p>
                                <p>“I have, however, made clear that the United States will not
                                    enter into any negotiations dealing with the territories, or
                                    rights of the Republic of China except in cooperation with the
                                    Republic of China.” (Department of State, Conference Files: Lot

                            Foreign Minister interpreted this to the President.</p>
                        <p>I then said that I thought it would be important for the military
                            advisers of our two governments to consider the problem of the defense
                            of Quemoy and the Matsu, to calculate what the chances of success were,
                            what the cost would be in terms of manpower and equipment; and I said I
                            would like to hear the views of the President as to the importance of
                            these islands in relation to the cost of their defense.</p>
                        <p>As the next matter, I turned to the question of the tanker <hi

                            seized. I said I would like to recommend to the President the release of
                            the <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi> and also the crew members who wanted
                            to be repatriated. I said that in the case of the Soviet tanker, it was
                            I thought useful to avoid giving the Soviets additional pretext for
                            helping the Chinese Communists; and while I thought that the particular
                            matter was not in itself important, nevertheless it could be used by the
                            Soviets as a pretext for action with the Communist Chinese. I thought
                            that the crew members should not be held against their wishes. We were
                            complaining about unlawful detentions on the <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323"
                                facs="0351"/>part of the Chinese Communists and hoped that the
                            Republic of China would set a better example to the world.</p>
                        <p>In the conclusion of my presentation, I dealt with the role of Free
                            China. I said that in my opinion, the Republic of China did have a
                            continuing and important role to play but it minimized this role to be
                            constantly talking about an armed reconquest of the Mainland.
                            Opportunities might arise and almost surely would arise, but they could
                            not be created by the Republic of China alone. They would be created by
                            the nature of the Communist regime. For example, there were almost sure
                            to be splits between the Communist leaders as there had been in Soviet
                            Russia when Stalin and Trotsky broke, when Beria was liquidated and now
                            when Malenkov was ousted. If, during this period, there had been a free
                            Russian Government possessed of power in close proximity to the Soviet
                            Union, it might have exerted a possibly decisive influence as between
                            the factions. Such opportunities were likely to occur in relation to
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, there was the possibility that the Chinese people in all or
                            parts of China might sometime be prepared to revolt against the harsh
                            treatment and bad economic conditions which were applied to them. Food
                            conditions were reported as very bad. If that situation came about, then
                            again there might be an opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, there was a possibility that Chinese Communist aggression
                            might create a situation where there was a general war against China.
                            There might, for example, be aggression against Southeast Asia or Korea,
                            in which case again there would be opportunity for the Republic of
                            China. The main point I wished to make was that these opportunities
                            which were quite likely to arise where [<hi rend="italic">were</hi>] not
                            opportunities which could be created by the Republic of China alone or
                            which could be dated. The opportunities would be created by forces
                            outside the Republic of China. Under these circumstances, it seemed
                            rather foolish for the Republic of China to try to hold out dates when
                            the forces of the Republic of China could successfully conquer the
                            Mainland. This was belittling and exposing the Republic of China to a
                            measure of ridicule abroad, as it seemed to others that it was foolish
                            for the Republic of China to be talking along these particular lines.
                            There was in fact a bigger role for the Republic of China, and we hoped
                            that the President could find it possible to explain that to his
                            people.</p>
                        <p>The President replied that he fully shared my view regarding the future
                            role of his government. In actual fact, there was nothing else it could
                            do. Now that the Mutual Security Treaty was in force, he wished to
                            assure me that he would take no independent action insofar as the use of
                            force was concerned, and would undertake no large-scale military
                            operations against the Mainland without full consultation <pb n="324"
                                xml:id="pg_324" facs="0352"/>with the US. He said, however, that he
                            had had to give due consideration to another important problem; namely,
                            the public handling of these matters in order to bolster morale and keep
                            hope alive regarding a return to the Mainland. This was another
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The President said for me to inform President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> that he would take no military action against
                            the Mainland without consultation with him. He also asked that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> be informed that
                            he could treat <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> as a true
                            friend and the Chinese Government as one which will cooperate on all
                            matters of major importance. He would not fail the United States in this
                            respect.</p>
                        <p>Regarding the question of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores and
                            also the situation with respect to Quemoy and Matsu, he fully agreed on
                            the need for the military people to go into this problem more deeply and
                            actively than had been done heretofore. He recalled that two years ago
                            the US and Nationalist China had engaged in military consultations<note
                                n="11" xml:id="d138fn11">Reference is apparently to staff-level
                                discussions held in May and December 1953; see despatch 660 from
                                Taipei, June 19, 1953, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 210.</note>
                            although nothing much had ever come out of these talks. He felt that a
                            joint military council, consisting of military representatives of the US
                            and the Republic of China, should be established to examine thoroughly
                            military problems. He hoped that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1"
                                >Carney</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Stump</persName> would be empowered to discuss the defense of
                            Formosa and Pescadores as well as the defense of Quemoy and Matsu with
                            his military advisers. Although he recognized there might be a
                            difference in the degree of such consultation as it related to Formosa
                            and the Pescadores on the one hand and Quemoy and Matsu on the other, he
                            sincerely hoped however that these matters could be discussed during
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> and Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>’s present visit to
                            Taipei.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above major problems which should be studied by the
                            military representatives of the two governments, there was another small
                            matter. When Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was
                                here,<note n="12" xml:id="d138fn12"><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                    >Radford</persName> visited the Republic of China at the end of
                                December 1954 during a trip to several Asian countries; see <ref
                                    target="#d9">Document 9</ref> for his remarks concerning Formosa
                                and the Tachens.</note> the President had discussed with him the
                            possibility of maintaining 21 fully trained and equipped active
                            divisions, and in addition the training and equipping of 9 reserve
                            divisions. This was 2 or 3 months ago, and he had received no word
                            regarding this project. He hoped that I would recommend that this
                            project be carried out since it was important.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was not familiar with the details of this matter and
                            that it should be discussed with Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1"
                                >Carney</persName> during his present visit. The President said he
                            hoped a decision could be <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0353"
                            />reached during Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1"
                            >Carney</persName>’s stay here, to which I made no reply.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he recalled an Air Force plan worked out last
                            year which had not yet been fully implemented. The objective of this
                            plan was to so equip the Chinese Nationalist Air Force so that it could
                            look out for the defense of Chinese Nationalist-held territory in
                            peacetime without requiring active US Air Force support. This was a
                            relatively small matter in terms of the overall problem, but was
                            nonetheless important.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I was not familiar with this question, but that immediate
                            military planning should be related to the military threat and perils of
                            today. I said long-term peacetime planning should be postponed because I
                            believed the immediate peril was very great and the study of how to meet
                            it should not be subordinated to overall long-range planning.</p>
                        <p>The President said he understood me to mean that I did not wish to avoid
                            long-term planning but wished to give priority to planning against the
                            immediate danger. The problem of Formosa’s air defense was he felt
                            related to the immediate defense problem.</p>
                        <p>The President said he wished to comment on the proposed cease-fire effort
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He again reassured me and
                            pledged now that the US-China treaty was in force, he would not initiate
                            any provocative action against the Mainland. However, for political
                            reasons he could never agree to a cease-fire against the Mainland. He
                            fully understood the position of the US, and why we had agreed to the
                            New Zealand proposal in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He also
                            understood and appreciated the moral gain which the Republic of China
                            could derive from a Soviet veto of a cease-fire resolution in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He said that while he could not stop
                            efforts in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> for cease-fire, he
                            wished to make it quite clear that when it came to substantive
                            discussion there, the Chinese Nationalist Government would not approve
                            such a resolution.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I did not ask him to support such a <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> resolution. It was entirely acceptable that he express
                            his reservations. I must, however, request with the greatest possible
                            strength and earnestness that if such a resolution came to a vote he
                            would not veto it but would let the Soviets veto it. I added that he
                            might feel that the action in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> was
                            some form of British plot, but the very fact that today the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> was strongly opposed to pressing a
                            cease-fire resolution in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, was
                            evidence that it was not such a British design.</p>
                        <p>The President laughed and said that he had told Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> last year when this subject
                            had been discussed that he feared <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            action was a <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> machination. I replied
                            that when I had recently seen <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony
                                Eden</persName>, he had urged me strongly not to proceed with <pb
                                n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0354"/>this matter at this time.
                            Regarding a Chinese Nationalist veto, the President said he would
                            consider the matter. Perhaps the matter would not come up and a decision
                            would not have to be made, but tactically he would prefer to let the
                            Soviets veto it.</p>
                        <p>The President said he next wished to comment on my remark that the
                            Chinese viewed the struggle with Communist China as a civil war. He said
                            that he and his government took a different position than the Chinese
                            Communists. His government believes the case should be presented to the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> as a situation threatening peace.
                            He would like to put the responsibility for the present aggression on
                            the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union. He thought that a ceasefire
                            resolution would open the way for acceptance of the concept of 2 Chinas.
                            If the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Security Council really meant
                            business, it should treat the present Communist aggression as a matter
                            threatening peace. He said that he did not consider it a civil war but
                            an international affair.</p>
                        <p>He then said that there was a good deal of plotting and conspiracy to get
                            Red China accepted in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He was
                            aware that much pressure was being brought to bear on the US in this
                            regard. He hoped the US would understand that the Chinese Nationalist
                            Government would never sit anywhere at the same table with the Chinese
                            Communists, much less in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. This was
                            a question of principle and character and he would rather lose
                            Nationalist China’s seat in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> than
                            share it with the Communists or sit at the same table with them. He said
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would doubtless be glad to know of
                            this decision. The <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might view this
                            decision as one of intransigence but he hoped the US, which he regarded
                            as the leader of the free world and the leader in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, would understand his view. No matter
                            what other nations like the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> might do
                            to support Communist China’s entry into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, he hoped the US would oppose it. It would be the irony
                            of fate if after all the sacrifices made by the Allies in the last war
                            and after the creation of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> by the
                            efforts of these Allies, Nationalist China should be condemned to accept
                            a regime which has used all its aggressive power against it and the rest
                            of the free world in the last few years.</p>
                        <p>I replied that the US had no intention of supporting Red China’s entry
                            into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President said he hoped
                            I would not only not support it, but would actively oppose it. He
                            observed that since I had been Secretary of State, I had carried out
                            this policy, and he hoped that I would continue so to do with added
                            firmness. I said I did not know how I could possibly add anything to my
                            firmness in this respect. The President laughingly agreed.</p>
                        <p>The President then said he would like to inquire whether Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> had anything to say.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> replied that he
                            was looking forward to talks with the Defense Minister and others of the
                                <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0355"/>President’s military
                            advisers. He hoped that they could identify the problems relating to the
                            proposal regarding joint and combined military planning.</p>
                        <p>I then observed that the President had made no comment on my suggestion
                            regarding the release of the <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi> and those
                            members of its crew who wished to be repatriated. I said that there was
                            an American proverb which said that silence meant acceptance, and I
                            hoped that this was also a Chinese proverb. The President replied that
                            he would release the <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi> and its crew members
                            at a price. He did not wish to release it as a token of goodwill toward
                            the Soviet Union. The Chinese Communists were holding innocent flyers,
                            had flagrantly violated the Korean Armistice and the US had done nothing
                            about it. He did not believe that the <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi>
                            should be released when the Communists behaved as they did. The price
                            would be the release of the flyers. He could not see why he should
                            release the ship at this time. I asked him whether this also applied to
                            the crew desiring repatriation. He said he would set free those who had
                            not chosen asylum.</p>
                        <p>Madame <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> immediately
                            interrupted to say that the crew would not be released unconditionally,
                            but only if the American flyers were released. She added as an
                            afterthought that this was her understanding of what the President had
                            said.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not quite like this position. It carried the inference
                            that because the Communists do wrong, the Chinese Nationalist Government
                            would similarly do wrong. I urged the President to set a higher standard
                            than the Communists. This would carry with it moral advantages to his
                            government, and be appreciated by the US. I believed it was better than
                            to hold the crew members as hostages against the release of the
                            flyers.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that this was the difference between the US as a
                            leader of the free world and Nationalist China as a victim of communism.
                            He said that he and his people had certain sentiments which he could not
                            expect US to share. He would however continue consultations with US
                            through the Embassy in Taipei on this matter. I replied that I
                            recognized that Nationalist China was a victim of communism and that
                            they had been subjected to grave aggravation. However, the driving
                            influence behind the US people, of which Nationalist China is a great
                            beneficiary, is the fact that we abide by, and are governed by moral
                            principles. I suspected that in the case of Nationalist China this might
                            require an especially great amount of <persName corresp="#p_HCA1"
                                >Christian</persName> charity. The President said he would continue
                            to study this problem. He knew my time schedule and that I was due to
                            depart from Taipei shortly. Therefore he did not wish to make me late
                            for departure. He had not finished all the things that he would like to
                            talk about, but he hoped to continue this at a future meeting.</p>
                        <pb n="328" xml:id="pg_328" facs="0356"/>
                        <p>He hoped that I would make frequent visits to Taipei in the future. I
                            said that I had made 2 trips in 6 months and that if I continued at this
                            cadence, he might soon get tired of me. He assured me to the
                            contrary.</p>
                        <p>Upon my departure Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>,
                            who was not scheduled to depart with me, remained behind at the

                            >Robertson</persName>. After your departure from President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s house March 3 I had short
                            conversation with him at his request. <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName> was also present. He asked me about British
                            position on various matters—referring to your earlier remark about
                            present <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> opposition to pressing for
                            action in the Security Council on New Zealand resolution, he asked
                            reason for this. I replied in my opinion <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> earnestly desired find peaceful solution Taiwan question
                            and wanted explore every avenue this end; that while <gloss

                            fighting for <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> conservative government
                            firmly supported our position keeping Taiwan and Penghu out of Communist
                            hands. I further stated <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> had apparently
                            become seriously concerned about Communist objectives in Asia; also if
                            New Zealand resolution were argued and voted on and presumably vetoed by
                            Soviets, resolution introduced by Soviets would then come up which
                            British naturally do not desire. <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> asked if this meant US and <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> positions on Far East in general had drawn closer
                            together. I replied, psychologically, although there was still the basic
                            cleavage on policy relating to Red China. I then pointed out current
                            political difficulties of conservative government and importance of not
                            adding to their embarrassements, adding that whatever differences in
                            views between US and present <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>
                            Government relating Far East policy a Labor government would be

                        <p>By prearrangement, I met with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> on his arrival at Taipei and prior to his meeting
                            with <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. I informed
                            him that I was deferring my own discussions with <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> authorities until after he
                                (<persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>) had seen <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. I informed him that U.S. press
                            notices had related our respective visits to Formosa, implying that
                            there was a connection. I showed him the statement that I tentatively
                            planned to give the press if they should ask for it; he approved it.</p>
                        <p>I then outlined for SecState the intended purpose of my visit and my
                            intended manner of approach to U.S. military personnel and to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s; I stated that it was my opinion
                            that the principal points meriting discussion all had some
                            government-level interest and therefore any guidance which he could give
                            me would be most helpful.</p>
                        <p>I carefully emphasized that my purpose was only to <hi rend="italic"
                                >identify</hi> the problems and that I could make few, if any,
                            decisions on the spot.</p>
                        <p>I then explained that it was now Defense policy to relate our assistance
                            efforts to the realities of the current situation and that the
                            Department of the Navy had been made the Executive agent for expediting
                            the correction of deficiencies; there is implicit a greater <pb n="330"
                                xml:id="pg_330" facs="0358"/>degree of urgency than heretofore in
                            view of Communist capabilities for launching attacks on the offshore
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>I then informed SecState that there were four areas which, in my opinion,

                                >Dulles</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I mentioned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> that I felt our conclusions, with respect to the
                            defense of the offshore islands, should take into consideration the most
                            objective possible thinking. On the assumption that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s could not defend the islands
                            without our assistance, it then became very necessary to fully
                            understand what the scope and character of what United States assistance
                            must be in order to insure success; were we to embark on military
                            measures less than necessary for success, we would find ourselves
                            embroiled in a doomed venture. This thought was of importance when
                            counselling the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s as to their
                            offshore efforts, as well as being of importance in determining U.S.
                            courses of action. In other words, I said that it appeared, from a
                            military standpoint, that we must be very factual in our own thinking
                            and the hard facts should always be in mind in connection with any
                            advice or opinions that we might give to the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s in connection with their own efforts to hold the

                        <p rend="center">IV</p>
                        <p>On Friday (the second day), and again on Saturday, I met with the
                            Minister of National Defense. These two meetings were rather different
                            in character and are therefore separately described.</p>
                        <p>At the first meeting, I outlined the four areas in which I thought there
                            should be a review in the light of the Treaty and of the actual military
                            situation. I stated that without implying specific intent, or implying
                            commitment on my part, I had in mind appropriate items for exploration
                            such matters as air defense, coordination of Naval operations, staff
                            coordination, actual requirements for mutual planning, development of
                            adequate communications, reevaluation of operational intelligence
                            arrangements, review of end item deliveries, etc.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Defense promptly launched into a strong plea for a
                            “combined staff”; I stated very firmly that I was not prepared to sign
                            any blank check for a combined staff setup per se. I stated that we were
                            looking for practical ways of achieving essential planning functions and
                            staff functions and it was necessary that these functions be very
                            clearly delineated as a prelude to any revision or change in staff
                            arrangements.</p>
                        <p>This question of a “combined staff” came up again and again and was
                            obviously the pet project of the Minister of Defense; in each instance,
                            I was equally firm in my insistence that such a proposal was premature
                            until we had determined what planning functions were necessary. In this
                            connection, I pointed out that <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> was the proper U.S. representative for looking into
                            what might be called strategic planning; as for operational planning, I
                            stated that I attached little value to any operational plans other than
                            those prepared by responsible commanders.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Defense then made three specific proposals: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>

                                    Pescadores. I agreed to the extent that Admiral <persName

                                    that there was no U.S. commitment with respect to the offshore

                                    commencing the conference on 25 March. (This could be considered
                                    as an “area” conference which will be brought to the attention

                        <p>After this, there was a rather general conversation concerning defense

                            agreement that the two most important matters requiring resolution at

                            night at a dinner which he gave in my honor.</p>
                        <p>At this second meeting with the Minister of Defense, he led off by saying
                            that the problem of the first and most urgent importance concerned the

                            Defense, are of particular interest because they give the appearance of

                            uniquely warm and merry. The conversation was completely devoid of
                            problem topics.</p>
                        <p>After dinner, I talked with the Gimo for the better part of an hour,
                            outlining for him the four areas which I sought to explore with the U.S.
                            military officials and the <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>. I
                            carefully explained that I was not here to make decisions, but to insure
                            that we identified items which would be essential to effective
                            operations in the event that U.S. forces were employed in support of the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty. If the interpreting was accurate, and the Gimo’s
                            replies and remarks as interpreted to me indicate that it was, there can
                            have been no misunderstanding on the Gimo’s part as to the exploratory
                            nature of my discussions or as to the fact that any major decisions of a
                            policy nature would be made in Washington, subject to such
                            recommendations as might be received from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Gimo was evidently most concerned about air defense and urged the
                            delivery of more planes to the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                            >ChiNat</gloss>s; I pointed out that mere delivery of planes was not the
                            answer in itself because there must be effective parallel programs to
                            meet such functions as early warning, intercept, <gloss target="#t_AA1"
                                >A.A.</gloss> protection and the various aspects of logistical
                            support, not to mention the satisfactory training of <gloss
                                target="#t_CAF1">CAF</gloss> personnel—all of which was a task of
                            such magnitude as not possible of timely accomplishment should there be
                            an urgent need for air defense in the immediate ensuing weeks. The Gimo
                            then stated, and I must agree, that the only alternative would be for
                            the <gloss target="#t_USAF1">USAF</gloss> to take over; in this
                            connection, I pointed out that there would be many matters of high U.S.
                            policy to be decided, not the least of which would be the assignment of
                            responsibility compatible with the obligations imposed. It was obviously
                            this interchange which prompted the message he sent to me the following
                            day, via <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>, to the effect that he
                            would accept U.S. command, subject to certain stipulations.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>

                        <p rend="center">VI</p>
                        <p>On Saturday morning, 5 March, at my request, <gloss target="#t_MND1"
                                >MND</gloss> gave me an appraisal of the tactical situation with
                            respect to the offshore islands. This was primarily for my own education
                            and nothing very noteworthy of interest to Washington was forthcoming,
                            except a general discussion concerning intelligence efforts, collection,
                            evaluation, and effectiveness. The three F–86 photo recon planes are now
                            in the hands of the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s and were
                            only awaiting good weather for their first photo flights. I looked at
                            their various photographs of the mainland fields, together with a number
                            of other interesting photographs of the areas in the vicinity of Quemoy
                            and Matsu, and I was favorably impressed with the fact that their
                            efforts in this respect are increasingly progressive and improving in
                            effectiveness. As a matter of fact, there appears to be very little
                            evidence of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> air buildup as
                            yet, except at the large field in the vicinity of Tachen, which appears
                            to be a major air base development.</p>
                        <p>These and other discussions also pointed up the fact that the
                            reorganization and employment of the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss> Navy has been attended by a more aggressive attitude
                            both in <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> and on the part of the
                            Navy.</p>
                        <p>On the completion of this <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss> briefing, I
                            was once more invited to the Gimo’s office, but this was a matter of
                            courtesy and ceremony and did not involve any business. The Gimo was
                            extremely cordial, stated that he considered that my visit had been
                            helpful and timely, expressed his high confidence in <persName

                                >Chase</persName>, and asked me to convey his warm personal regards
                            to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and Major
                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>.</p>
                        <p rend="center">VII</p>
                        <p>While in Taipei, I conferred with Admiral Overesch; this meeting is
                            described in a separate memorandum.<note n="4" xml:id="d140fn4">Not
                                found in Department of State files.</note></p>
                        <p rend="center">VIII</p>
                        <p>In addition to the broad discussions described above, I took the
                            opportunity of inquiring into the affairs of the Chinese Navy and had
                            appropriate discussions with Minister <persName corresp="#p_YT1"
                                >Yu</persName>, Admiral Liang, General <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1"
                                >Chase</persName>, Chief Navy Section <gloss target="#t_MAAG1"
                                >MAAG</gloss> (Brodie), as well as Admirals <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s responded wholeheartedly
                            to the very critical analysis which I made of their organization and
                            programs on the occasion of my last visit in December 1953. They have
                            now established a <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0363"/>sound
                            framework of departmental and operational organization, their
                            operational training and maintenance planning is on a far sounder basis,
                            and they are manifesting a more aggressive outlook with respect to
                            operations vis-à-vis the Commies. In this connection, the Minister of
                            Defense very forcefully stated that he wanted them to fight and was not
                            holding back.</p>
                        <p>There is still room for much improvement, but the improvement which they
                            have achieved in the past year deserves commendatory notice which I did
                            not withhold.</p>
                        <p>At all levels, they beg for more DD-DE ships; I was very frank with them
                            and told them that whereas I sympathetically understood their desire and
                            need, the United States had its own problems in this very valuable
                            category and that I was not prepared to make any promises which I could
                            not fulfill, other than to say that I stood by my earlier promise to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_YT1">Yu</persName> that I would wholeheartedly
                            support replacement of any ship lost in honest combat.</p>
                        <p>The request for <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>’s was also very much
                            on their minds and I came to believe that they are still making use of
                            ships that no sailor in his right mind would go to sea in if he could
                            avoid it. I have directed Captain Brodie (Navy Section, <gloss
                                target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>), to make another careful review of
                            this matter of <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>’s, taking into
                            cognizance actual operational needs, seaworthiness of ships, minimum
                            maintenance requirements, and other pertinent factors as a basis for
                            permitting me to determine what recommendation I should make for any
                            additional procurement of <gloss target="#t_LST1">LST</gloss>’s for the
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> Navy.</p>
                        <p rend="center">Conclusion</p>
                        <p>I have furnished <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> with a copy
                            of this memorandum as an Aide-Mémoire and for his guidance. I intend to
                            await further recommendation from <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> on the items discussed, and hereinbefore described,
                            but I have emphasized to him the necessity for handling his further
                            studies in the premise as a matter of urgency. The only decision
                            rendered on the spot had to do with the initiation, on an emergency
                            basis, by Vice Admiral <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>,
                            of requirements for contingent operational plans and arrangements for
                            combined operations should they be ordered.</p>
                        <p>I have emphasized to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>, and
                            informed <gloss target="#t_MND1">MND</gloss>, that air defense and the
                            development of suitable joint codes constitute the two most urgent
                            requirements at the moment.</p>
                        <p>Pursuant to certain purely U.S. discussions, <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"
                                >CINCPAC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_CNO1">CNO</gloss> concurred
                            in General <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1">Chase</persName>’s opinion that
                            the U.S. should support troops deployed to Kinmen and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>The need for more full and prompt furnishing of intelligence information
                            to <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> and to the Pentagon was
                            stressed. The intelligence <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0364"
                            />available in Taipei is better than had been apparent in Washington and
                            there can be immediate improvement in the distribution process. There
                            is, however, also an overall need for greater capability for collection,
                            evaluation, and distribution of intelligence and the Department of
                            Defense should be prepared to furnish additional assistance as will be
                            shortly requested by <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I would again invite attention, as said to the Secretary of
                            State, that U.S. policy with respect to defense of the offshore islands
                            should be based on completely objective appraisal. If the offshore
                            islands can not be held without U.S. assistance, then the character and
                            scope of U.S. assistance required to insure such defense must be
                            thoroughly understood. Otherwise, we run the risk of becoming embroiled
                            in an unsuccessful venture. From a military point of view, I believe
                            that this factor must be kept closely in mind in connection with any
                            counsel we may give to the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s,
                            as well as in connection with any U.S. decision that may be taken.</p>

                        <p>I reported to the President the conclusions from my trip.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Quemoy and Matsu, I said I did not think that as things
                            now stood we could sit by and watch the Nationalist forces there be
                            crushed by the Communists. I felt that the reaction not only on Formosa
                            but in other parts of Asia would be dangerously bad. On the other hand,
                            I hoped that if there was time, <persName>Chiang</persName> might
                            reorient his policies so that less importance would attach to these
                            islands. I referred to my statement to <persName>Chiang</persName> which
                            the President said he had read and thought well of.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his agreement with me that, under present
                            conditions, we should help to support these two coastal positions. I
                            said that this would require the use of atomic missiles. The President
                            said that he thoroughly agreed with this, and, indeed, he <pb n="337"

                            weapons as interchangeable with the conventional weapons. This did not,
                            of course, mean weapons of mass destruction. He said that with the
                            number of planes that we had available in the Asian area, it would be
                            quite impractical to accomplish the necessary results in the way of
                            putting out airfields and gun emplacements without using atomic
                            missiles.</p>
                        <p>I asked the President to look over the last pages of my draft report<note

                            his approval. He did so and indicated that it did have his approval
                            subject to two slight verbal changes. He said he would read the rest of
                            the speech during the evening.</p>

                        <p>I reviewed briefly the impressions of my trip, the overriding impression
                            of the danger from Communist subversion and aggression, and the
                            importance of our standing firm. I said that I felt that under present
                            conditions it would be impossible for us to stand by and do nothing
                            while the Chinese Communists took Quemoy and Matsus by force. I said the
                            psychological repercussions on Formosa and in Southeast Asia would, I
                            thought, make it almost certain that most of Asia would be lost to us. I
                            then said that an effective defense of these islands would require the
                            use of atomic weapons because it would not be possible to knock out
                            airfields and gun implacements with conventional weapons in the face of
                            Chinese manpower and capacity to replace and rebuild. Senator <persName
                                corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> said he assumed this did not
                            include any mass destruction weapons, and I confirmed that this was the
                            case. I said that the missiles we had in mind had practically no
                            radioactive fall-out and were entirely local in effect. Senator <pb

                                >George</persName> indicated his agreement with my analysis,
                            although he seemed to share my own feeling that it would be preferable
                            if the importance of these coastal positions could be diminished through
                            changed policies of <persName>Chiang</persName>. He asked about the
                            situation on the island, whether I thought there was much subversion
                            there. I indicated that I feared subversion and also relations between
                            the native Chinese on the island and the new group that had come over
                            with <persName>Chiang</persName>, particularly the Army people, were not
                            very good.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> said that his
                            Committee would like to hear me and asked if it would be agreeable for
                            me to meet with them Tuesday at 10:30 a.m.<note n="2" xml:id="d142fn2"

                                question at issue was the means by which those claims were to be
                                prosecuted. It inquired whether the Chinese Government would state
                                publicly or privately that while maintaining its claims it did not
                                intend to prosecute them by force and stated that if so, the British
                                would be prepared to approach the U.S. Government with what they
                                believed was a good hope of finding a peaceful settlement of the

                        <p>From Singapore, he went to Rangoon, where <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U

                            views on Formosa. This idea was later discussed between <persName

                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> in New Delhi and they agreed that
                            it was not in present circumstances practicable to contemplate a meeting
                            at which only one of the parties to the dispute was represented, the
                            more so since no basis for agreement seemed to exist at present.</p>

                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> said he was anxious to
                            hear how the Secretary felt after his Far Eastern trip about the
                            off-shore islands situation, and what he thought should be done
                            next.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that before getting into that subject he would like to
                            mention that he had enjoyed working with the New Zealand Foreign
                            Minister at Bangkok. The friendly resolution addressed to the Afro-Asian
                                Conference<note n="2" xml:id="d144fn2">Reference is to a statement
                                issued on February 26 by the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>
                                Council in Bangkok extending greetings to the countries attending
                                the Asian-African Conference which was to be held in Bandung in
                                April. For text, see Department of State <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Bulletin</hi>, March 7, 1955, p. 373.</note> was the idea of
                            Foreign Minister Macdonald. This was a nice move. It would give our
                            friends at the Afro-Asian Conference a card to play with. A theme had
                            been established which delegations at Bandung could support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had talked to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> at length in regard to the problem of the islands.
                            He had told <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> that he felt we
                            should proceed further with Operation <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had asked that we defer
                            action on <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> until he could explore the
                            issue further with the Chinese Communists. The Secretary said the
                            results of that exploration did not strike him as encouraging.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> agreed that the Chinese
                            Communist reaction as he had received it from the British certainly was
                            not encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had
                            just returned from his trip and had been quite busy in the House of
                            Commons. There was no personal message from <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> yet. However the Secretary had seen copies of the
                            British correspondence with Peiping, but he did not yet have <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s views on the Chinese Communist
                            rejection. The Secretary said his own feeling was that there was a
                            likelihood that severe fighting might break out and there was a danger
                            that the U.S. might be drawn in. It was his strong feeling that a more
                            determined effort for a cease fire should be made in the near future. It
                            was essential to get the record clear as to our genuine desire for a
                            cease fire. He remarked that the Chinese Nationalists seemed as about
                                [<hi rend="italic">about as</hi>] opposed to a cease fire as the
                            Chinese Communists. Neither side wanted any action taken which would
                            stay its hand in the prosecution of the Chinese civil war. In Taipei the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> had spoken
                            strongly against a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> cease fire effort.
                            Nevertheless the Secretary felt that we must proceed further. He felt we
                            should first give <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> a little
                            time to catch his breath. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            had been informed that we would probably want to go ahead with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> move if the British did not
                            succeed <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0369"/>with their
                            representations to the Chinese Communists. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had consistently been more optimistic than the
                            Secretary as to the prospects of getting Chinese Communist concurrence.
                            However the Secretary had not discouraged <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> in his desire to make the approach to the Chinese
                            Communists. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had said in his
                            speech yesterday<note n="3" xml:id="d144fn3">For text of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s statement before the House

                                    Debates</hi>, vol. 538, cols. 157–166.</note> that the time did
                            not seem to be ripe to make progress. The Secretary did not think the
                            situation would remain static. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had commended the Chinese Communist restraint, but
                            the U.S. could not perceive any indication that the Chinese Communists
                            would abstain from their declared objectives. The present lull is being
                            used by them for a large-scale build up. <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U
                                Nu</persName> had told the Secretary in Rangoon that he was
                            convinced the Chinese Communists are determined to attack Formosa.<note

                                    Reiterated US would have to resist Chinese Communist attempt
                                    seize Taiwan, but if Chinese Communists genuinely desired
                                    peaceful settlement and will give assurance not to use force
                                    against Taiwan that would be different situation. However, they
                                    give every indication intention try take Taiwan.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> commented that his
                                    visit to China [in December 1954] had convinced him Chinese
                                    Communists really fear Taiwan is going to be used as base for
                                    launching invasion against mainland. He repeated several times
                                    his distinct impression they have firm intention take Taiwan by
                                    force. This conclusion made him want to go immediately to
                                    Washington to inform Secretary. Various matters had prevented
                                    this, so he wanted now to convey this view to Secretary.”

                            <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> thought that the Chinese
                            Communist attitude was “Formosa or nothing”. A dangerous situation would
                            exist if the morale on Formosa should deteriorate. The Chinese
                            Communists might be successful in getting some defections through
                            infiltration combined with military action. A few Nationalist Generals
                            might defect. That could make trouble.</p>

                            recent visit.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said on the surface morale seemed pretty good. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> was just back and he
                            and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> might be able
                            to say something more definite on military morale, based on their longer
                            stay.</p>

                            discussion would be strictly limited. The objective of all three would
                            be to stop the fighting. Other items such as the status of the two rival
                            Chinese Governments, etc. would be strictly excluded. We would hope and
                            expect that differences in U.S. and <gloss target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss>
                            policy as to China would not come out. It would certainly be unfortunate
                            if they did. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had already
                            been informed that as things were shaping up, it seemed that fighting
                            might be in prospect. The U.S. would want to proceed with a resolution
                            in the Security Council, even if the U.S. should have to introduce the
                            resolution itself. The U.S. would want to make it clear to world opinion
                            that it was leaving no stone unturned to obtain a cease fire. This was
                            an essential part of our case. If New Zealand should be inclined to
                            hesitate, the U.S. would be prepared to make the move.</p>
                        <p>… <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> asked if the Secretary
                            could give him an estimate of the likelihood of an imminent Communist

                        <p>The Secretary said there was no evidence of any significant new

                            to take Quemoy. Additional heavy artillery is being emplaced. An
                            airfield directly opposite central Formosa is being improved—the runways
                            lengthened and widened. There is nothing to show that an attack may
                            occur in the immediate future, that is the next two or three weeks.
                            Opposite Matsu, it is more difficult to judge the situation. It was
                            reported that heavy artillery of Soviet design was being installed which
                            would bring Matsu within range. The U.S. military people out there think
                            that any assault will be preceded by a prolonged artillery barrage
                            intended to interdict resupply of the islands. It is estimated that
                            Quemoy and Matsu have some 35 to 40 days’ supply of food and ammunition.
                            If resupply cannot be maintained, the ability to withstand prolonged
                            artillery bombardment will be reduced. The Nationalists would be in a
                            bad position unless the Communist artillery positions in the Mainland
                            could be knocked out. These positions are well recessed in the hills and
                            it might take atomic missiles to silence them.</p>
                        <p>… <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> said he had told
                                Zaroubin<note n="6" xml:id="d144fn6">Soviet Ambassador to the United
                                States Georgi N. Zaroubin.</note> that in his view the Chinese
                            Communists could not wage a war for any length of time without Soviet
                            support and assistance. <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName>
                            said he gained two principal impressions from Zaroubin’s remarks: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Soviets are concerned at the situation.</item>

                        <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0371"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said he could understand such a feeling. He remarked that
                            we know from our experience with the South Koreans and Chinese
                            Nationalists that it is not so easy to control an Asiatic ally even
                            though you have physical control through the supplies which you furnish
                            him. You can not just say, “If you don’t do this, you won’t get anything
                            more”. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> know that they could precipitate a
                            difficult situation if they wanted to. The Chinese Communists could do
                            the same. The Soviets would not have much choice but to support the
                            Chinese Communists if they get involved.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> remarked that under
                            the tripartite agreement on Operation <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>,
                            there is no further commitment on anybody’s part, since the Chinese
                            Communists have rejected the invitation to appear before the Security
                            Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he thought the understanding was that we would wait a
                            reasonable time, then consult on going ahead with the operation. He was
                            sure the British would want to avoid debating the larger issues in the
                            Security Council just as we do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that the only
                            commitment was to consult on further steps.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> asked if the Secretary
                            wanted to wait a few days before making the next move?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this was correct. He wanted to give <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> a chance to think things over in
                            the light of the Chinese Communist reply. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> knew how the Secretary felt. The Secretary felt we
                            should give <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> a few days more
                            to consider the matter.</p>
                        <p>Amb. <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> said that Holcombe
                                [<persName corresp="#p_HSG1"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Holland</hi></persName>?] and Macdonald were now back in <persName
                                corresp="#p_KVKW1">Wellington</persName> and the New Zealand Cabinet
                            would be ready to consider the question promptly when the time came.</p>

                        <p>The British Ambassador called this noon at his request. He referred
                            briefly to the Secretary’s speech the evening before and to <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony Eden</persName>’s statement yesterday
                            in the House. He thought the two of them did not hang together too
                            badly.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary remarked that he considered Bangkok a good meeting and that
                            it had given him the opportunity to have several long talks with
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName>. He said that he
                            had not discouraged <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> from
                            making a private approach to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> since he felt that if it were successful it was
                            all to the good whereas if it was a failure it would give <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> further insight into
                            Chinese Communists’ purposes.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> agreed and commented
                            that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s speech had been well
                            received on both sides of the aisle and that he felt he now had firm
                            bipartisan support on the line he was taking. The Ambassador then
                            inquired where we stood on the matter of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi>. The Secretary replied that he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> at Bangkok that we wanted
                            to proceed with the resolution. He felt it necessary to demonstrate our
                            full efforts to secure a cease-fire and that if New Zealand was
                            reluctant we were willing to proceed with the resolution on our own
                            responsibility. He agreed, however, to suspend action until <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> had had a chance to approach
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. This had been
                            done and now he would like to move ahead. In fact he had told <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSL1">Sir Leslie Munro</persName> of his attitude in the
                            matter this morning. He recognized however that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> had only just returned to
                            London and would need to have a few days to get his bearings. It wasn’t
                            an urgent matter in terms of a few days but he would like the Ambassador
                            to report to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> his
                            desire to move ahead and secure his reaction. He added that the
                            President felt a very real responsibility in line with his Message to
                            the Congress to push the matter as far as possible in the United
                            Nations, and he did not feel we had yet exhausted these
                            possibilities.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said that he was
                            without instructions but was inclined to think personally that <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> would consider that British
                                <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0373"/>public opinion was now
                            entirely clear concerning the pacific intentions of the U.S. There was
                            consequently no need to make a further demonstration on this point and
                            to raise the issue in the Security Council in the form of a resolution
                            which would ultimately have to be voted on might merely stir things up.
                            The Secretary reiterated his desire to move ahead on the resolution
                            without undue loss of time.</p>

                                the Formosan Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>Before Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> began to
                            speak, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> invited Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> to make any comment
                            he might wish to at this time regarding the military situation in the
                            general area of Formosa. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> confined himself to pointing out that the
                            Chinese Nationalists were currently engaged in reinforcing the garrisons
                            on the Matsu Islands.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then took the
                            floor. He explained that he had pretty well covered the general aspects
                            of his Far Eastern trip in his recent speech. He wanted, therefore, to
                            confine himself on this occasion to the Formosa problem, which he had
                            found to be critical and acute. Perhaps, he speculated, we should have
                            taken this problem more seriously at an earlier time. It seemed to him
                            at least an even chance that the United States would have to fight in
                            this area before we were through. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> expressed the emphatic belief that the Chinese
                            Communists were determined to capture Formosa. As to the related problem
                            of Quemoy and the Matsus, it bristled with difficulties. No solution to
                            the Formosa problem would be provided if the United States determined to
                            give up Quemoy and the Matsus to Communist China. We would still
                            thereafter face an unmitigated threat to Formosa itself. So the question
                            of a fight for Formosa appeared to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> as a question of time rather than a question of
                            fact. This, he said, did not necessarily mean general war, but the
                            Chinese Communists would have to put our resolution to hold Formosa to
                            the test before there was any chance that they would give up their
                            determination to seize the island.</p>
                        <p>Recent reports, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, indicated to him very clearly that the real
                            resolve and the ultimate objective of the Chinese Communists was the
                            liquidation of the Chinese Nationalist Government if this lay within
                            their power. Their ultimate objective vis-à-vis Formosa was to rid
                            themselves of a rival power close at hand. Parenthetically, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, this was the
                            same impression which <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>, the
                            Burmese Prime Minister, held respecting Chinese Communist
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> noted that the
                            contents of a message which <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> had sent to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir
                                Anthony Eden</persName><note n="2" xml:id="d146fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d143fn3">footnote 3, Document 143</ref>.</note>
                            substantially restated the familiar position that Communist China took
                            vis-à-vis the United States: It was the United States which was
                            encouraging aggression, and the only solution which would bring peace to
                            the area was the withdrawal of all U.S. forces.</p>
                        <p>After thus emphasizing the seriousness of the general situation,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he now
                            wished to give special consideration to <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347"
                                facs="0375"/>certain specific aspects of this general situation. The
                            first concerned the timing of any U.S. intervention. He earnestly hoped
                            that the United States might avoid any armed clash with the Communist
                            Chinese until after the ratification of the London–Paris
                                agreements.<note n="3" xml:id="d146fn3">The agreements under
                                reference, signed at Paris on October 23, 1954, but not yet
                                ratified, provided for the establishment of the Western European
                                Union and the accession of the Federal Republic of Germany to the
                                North Atlantic Treaty Organization; for text, see <ref

                                    Part 2, pp. 1435</ref> ff.</note> Accordingly, in so far as it
                            was possible without sacrificing our vital objectives, we should
                            temporize regarding Formosa until the ratification of the WEU pacts had
                            actually been accomplished.</p>
                        <p>His second important point, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, was to emphasize the importance of making U.S.
                            public opinion genuinely aware of the very grave prospect which the
                            United States faced in the Formosa area. He did not believe that
                            American opinion in general was aware of how critical the issues
                            were.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> called
                            for urgent steps to create a better public climate for the use of atomic
                            weapons by the United States if we found it necessary to intervene in
                            the defense of the Formosa area. Conversations he had had with our
                            military people in the area, continued Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, had pretty well convinced him
                            that atomic weapons were the only effective weapons which the United
                            States could use against a variety of mainland targets, particularly
                            against Chinese Communist airfields which they would use to attack
                            Formosa, against key railroad lines, and gun emplacements. Accordingly,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought that
                            very shortly now the Administration would have to face up to the
                            question whether its military program was or was not in fact designed to
                            permit the use of atomic weapons. We might wake up one day and discover
                            that we were inhibited in the use of these weapons by a negative public
                            opinion. If this proved to be the fact, our entire military program
                            would have to be drastically revised and we should have to develop
                            duplicate programs involving conventional weapons on the one hand and
                            nuclear weapons on the other. There was indeed very great concern on the
                            part of our military people in the Formosa area with respect to this
                            particular problem. It was of vital importance, therefore, that we
                            urgently educate our own and world opinion as to the necessity for the
                            tactical use of atomic weapons. At the President’s suggestion, continued
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, he had included
                            reference to this point in his recent speech, but much more remained to
                            be done if we were to be able to make use of tactical atomic weapons,
                            perhaps within the next month or two. Public opinion in Asia was not at
                            all attuned to such a possibility.</p>
                        <pb n="348" xml:id="pg_348" facs="0376"/>
                        <p>His next point, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, was to point to the necessity that this country
                            pay much more careful attention to the problem of the loyalty of the
                            Chinese Nationalist forces on Formosa itself. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated his view that we had
                            in the past been far too complacent about this matter. If even a small
                            portion of a Chinese Communist military force succeeded in making a
                            landing on Formosa and was thereafter met by the defection of one or
                            more of the Chinese Nationalist armies, the situation could be very
                            serious. Morale on the island was in general not too good and, of
                            course, had lately been shaken by the withdrawal of the garrisons from
                            the Tachens, etc. It was accordingly not inconceivable that with
                            skillful bribery some of the Chinese Nationalist generals could be
                            bought by the Communists. This had happened many times before in the
                            history of China, and indeed one of the reasons for becoming a general
                            in China was to get oneself bought. <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> therefore faced a very difficult task to
                            maintain or to restore morale.</p>
                        <p>In the latter connection, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, he had undertaken during his visit to paint for
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> a somewhat
                            different picture, stressing the long-term future of Formosa rather than
                            the prospect of any early return to the mainland; but such a drastic
                            transition of attitude obviously presented difficult problems. The
                            problems would certainly not be settled by any methods of shock
                            treatment. Employment of shock treatment methods would risk the loss of
                            Formosa, and if that island were lost the entire U.S. position in Asia
                            would be lost with it.</p>
                        <p>All the foregoing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> indicated, seemed to point up the fact that in
                            some respects our U.S. intelligence material had not been too good. The
                            personnel of our U.S. <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> on Formosa
                            were too few in number and too busy to give this problem adequate
                            attention, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>
                            was now concerning himself with it personally. Along with this emphasis
                            on more adequate operational intelligence, the Administration must see
                            to it that we do everything we possibly can to develop the capabilities
                            of the Chinese Nationalist Government itself to protect Formosa and the
                            offshore islands, at least until such time as the London–Paris pacts are
                            ratified.</p>
                        <p>On the whole, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            reiterated, the situation was far more serious than he had believed it
                            to be before he had taken his trip. He again repeated his conviction
                            that the Chinese Communists will not call it quits on Formosa on any
                            terms that the United States could accept. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Sir Anthony Eden</persName> himself may be beginning to realize
                            that the foregoing is the real position of Communist China. The
                            Communist Chinese will never accept our position in Formosa until they
                            have had demonstrated to their satisfaction that we cannot be dislodged
                            from this position. Therefore, Communist probing will go on, and there
                            will perhaps be no definite answer until the United <pb n="349"
                                xml:id="pg_349" facs="0377"/>States decides to “shoot off a gun” in
                            the area. We may have to demonstrate our position by deeds rather than
                            by words.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the foregoing, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> repeated his injunction that we improve our
                            intelligence material and that we give as much matèriel support to the
                            Chinese Nationalists as possible in order to avoid the contingency of
                            too early intervention by United States armed forces, and finally, to be
                            ready if necessary to use atomic weapons.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            merely wanted to say that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have consistently
                            asserted that we should have to use atomic weapons. Indeed our whole
                            military structure had been built around this assumption. He said that
                            he was convinced that we could not handle the military situation in the
                            Far East, particularly as regards aircraft, unless we could employ
                            atomic weapons. We simply did not have the requisite number of air bases
                            to permit effective air attack against Communist China, using

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired of Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> as to the probable
                            timing—that is, the season of the year—most favorable for a Communist
                            attempt to seize the offshore islands or Formosa itself. With regard to
                            the offshore islands, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that the attempt could be made at almost
                            any time. The most favorable season for an attempt against Formosa
                            itself would be the interval between April and October.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said that he
                            desired to state to the Council that, apropos of Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ observations regarding the
                            shortcomings of our intelligence, nothing had been said in the course of
                            the discussion which had come to him as a surprise. The <gloss
                                target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> had long since been pointing out all
                            these facts on the basis of intelligence available to it. However,
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that
                            there was insufficient U.S. personnel attached to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMGWC1">Chase</persName>’s mission on Formosa to
                            evaluate accurately intelligence materials provided by the Chinese. As
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had said,
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1">Chase</persName> has only a small
                                <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss>, with insufficient personnel
                            to handle adequately the operational intelligence which was
                            available.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’
                            comments on the state of morale on Formosa, the President said that of
                            course the United States alone could not save Formosa if its people did
                            not want to be saved from Communism. What Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had had to report on the subject
                            put things in a very different light than he had hitherto regarded them
                            in. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            of course morale on Formosa depended very largely on the United States
                            itself. To this, the President said that at least he thought that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s army was loyal to
                            him. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied
                            that this was not necessarily the case. The matter of morale was largely
                            a factor of the reality of hopes to <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350"
                                facs="0378"/>return to the mainland. Such hopes were necessary to
                            sustain these 700,000 military men. The President responded with a
                            statement that while this might be true, he could not see what the
                            Quemoys and the Matsus had to do with the business. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> answered that continuing to
                            hold these offshore islands was of immense help to the morale of the
                            Chinese Nationalist forces, for the very reason that in these islands
                            the Nationalist forces came into actual contact with the enemy. This
                            tended to provide some tangible hope of ultimate return to the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p>In a philosophical vein, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> observed that of course time changes things; but
                            at this particular moment the United States could not sit idly by and
                            watch the Chinese Nationalist forces on Quemoy and the Matsus sustain a
                            terrific defeat or be wiped out, without such repercussions that we
                            would be likely to lose Formosa itself as a result. Nor, on the other
                            hand, could we force the Chinese Nationalists to agree to evacuate these
                            offshore islands. In this was the dilemma and the danger of the current
                            situation, which, however, could conceivably change in, say, a year’s
                            time.</p>
                        <p>The discussion closed with an unanswered speculation by Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> as to whether or not the
                            intelligence available to the United States Government provided any
                            answer to the question whether the Chinese Communists were likely to
                            make a major attempt to seize the offshore islands prior to the
                            Afro-Asian Conference. Admittedly, continued Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, they had the capability to
                            seize the islands, though they would encounter very great difficulty in
                            the effort to take the Quemoys.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#p_HSWG1">Hayter</persName> was instructed merely to
                            tell <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> that British
                            Government was continuing its efforts to find some mechanism for dealing
                            with Formosan question and to express hope that Soviet Government would
                            likewise continue its efforts in that direction.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied that process was
                            slow but that efforts should continue and then made the amazing
                            statement that at least one thing had emerged from the exchanges between
                            British and Soviet Governments and that was that <persName

                            represented at any conference or meeting.</p>
                        <p>Although <persName corresp="#p_HSWG1">Hayter</persName> had no
                            instructions on this point, he immediately told <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> then dropped the

                            somewhat crude attempt to associate British Government with Communist
                            position on this point was that it might be reflection of Soviet desire
                            to show Chinese that it was worth-while continuing to explore
                            possibilities through diplomatic channels. This, of course, is mere

                                <p>“I am concerned because the purposes of Red China are more
                                    virulent than I realized before I left this country. I had talks
                                    with the Burmese Prime Minister and with <persName
                                        corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> who has been conducting
                                    conversations with the Communists of Peiping, and I must tell
                                    you this. The Chinese Reds have a fanatical determination to
                                    eradicate any impression of good will for the United States in
                                    their part of the world. I disagree with the British and I am
                                    sure that we are living in a fool’s paradise if we have any idea
                                    that we can make an easy trade with the Communists for the
                                    offshore islands. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                        En-lai</persName> flatly rejected such a trade, brands the
                                    United States as aggressors and will have nothing to do with the
                                    deal the British were trying to work out on the offshore
                                    islands. As a matter of fact, I received information just before
                                    I came over here that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                        En-lai</persName> in a recent talk with the Finnish Minister
                                    had said that China would be in war with the United States, that
                                    the United States would kill 100 million Chinese but that there
                                    would still be 500 million Chinese left.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>Regarding Formosa, Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            said that he had a distinct feeling, but without tangible evidence, that
                            there could be much subversive activity in Formosa if we press <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> too hard. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> does continue to talk of a
                            return to the mainland, but he accepts the U.S. position and says that
                            he will not attempt any return without U.S. concurrence.</p>
                        <p>Sec. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> thought the Chinese
                            Communists would continue to exert pressure until they found the point
                            where we would have to react by shooting; he added however that this
                            might be merely a war of nerves. He continued to think that the Chinese,
                            with their hatred for the West, aimed to take over Southeast Asia and
                            would prefer to die in the effort than fail to accomplish it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> concluded that the
                            United States must be prepared to face a quite serious showdown in that
                            part of the world. While it is not possible to judge whether Russia is
                            backing the Chinese effort or is without control over it, the evidence
                            is that Russian actions are minimal. Nevertheless, there could be secret
                            Russian support of the Chinese. In any event, any acceptance of further
                            defeats or withdrawals, he said, would greatly jeopardize U.S. interests
                            and position in Formosa and all of Southeast Asia.</p>

                        <p>The President had the draft of a possible communication to President
                                Coty<note n="2" xml:id="d149fn2">President René Coty of
                                France.</note> which we went over together and which, after making
                            some penciled interlineations, he gave me to bring back to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>I said I wanted to discuss further the question of the Formosa situation.
                            I realized that the decision of what to do was a very difficult <pb
                                n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0382"/>one. It was somewhat parallel
                            perhaps to the situation in Europe in the Thirties where it was hard to
                            know to what extent one was justified in giving way in the interest of
                            peace and of flouting world opinion. It seemed that in the case of
                            Europe there had been too much retreat and that the timing as to when to
                            stand had been bad. In this situation it was also difficult to know and
                            to pick the correct time. I was satisfied that from the standpoint of
                            the position in Formosa and the general attitude of the Thailand and
                            Indochina States that we could not, without great danger, seem to
                            retreat further. However, I wanted to be sure that my thinking was in
                            line with that of the President. I said I thought I should say there was
                            not complete agreement within the State Department on this matter and
                            that in particular Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> was
                            in considerable disagreement with my views. It was, however, essential
                            that I be sure that I was in step with the President’s thinking.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he had the impression that <persName
                                corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> was generally disposed to take a
                            rather more sympathetic line towards the Chinese Communists than was the
                            President and, therefore, this disagreement with me did not weigh
                            strongly with the President.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the substance of the matter, the President said that he
                            felt that the Quemoy-Matsu situation was a liability. He did not see any
                            present way to liquidate it. He recognized that we probably could not
                            now get the Chinese Nationalists to evacuate and also that it would be
                            serious there and elsewhere for us to sit idly by as spectators while
                            their positions were overrun by some massive Communist assault.
                            Therefore, he shared my conclusions about the matter.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi> story<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d149fn3">Dated March 11.</note> attributing to Congressman
                                <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> an allegation that
                            the President and I differed on this matter. I stated that my
                                testimony<note n="4" xml:id="d149fn4">Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> testified before the House

                            had given no basis for this whatsoever, and I pointed out that under the
                            law the President was required to exercise his own judgment in the
                            matter and that such a judgment could not be made prematurely. I went on
                            to say to the President, however, that this situation created a problem
                            from the standpoint of public relations in that it inhibited an adequate
                            advance preparation for military intervention in the event that it was
                            judged necessary. I said that probably the President would be faced with
                            a question on this matter at his next press conference. The President
                            said he would be disposed to reply along the lines that we had
                            heretofore followed, mainly that he would make the judgment when
                            circumstances required in the light of all the circumstances, but <pb
                                n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0383"/>that he had not made the
                            judgment yet because there was no need for it.</p>
                        <p>I said that I felt that it would be useful for the President and for me
                            if we could get a clearer report from the military people as to what
                            their estimate was as to the imminence of attack and the defensive
                            capacity of the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s and also with
                            reference to our Intelligence. I said that from the standpoint of timing
                            it would, I thought, be extremely important to avoid, if possible, any
                            U.S. hostilities, particularly involving atomic missiles, while the WEU
                            situation was still unsettled. After that was buttoned up he could have
                            more freedom of action in Asia. I said also this could be one of the
                            matters where he could do an educational job with the British and others
                            if a meeting was held in Paris in May, as was being considered. The
                            President agreed and said that this was, in his mind, one of the most
                            important purposes of the meeting.</p>
                        <p>The President also arranged to have a meeting at 2:30 in the afternoon at
                            which the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would be present.<note

                                    where they must choose between (a) not responding to local
                                    aggression and (b) applying force in a way which our own people
                                    or our allies would consider entails undue risk of nuclear
                                    devastation. However, the United States cannot afford to
                                    preclude itself from using nuclear weapons even in a local
                                    situation, if such use will bring the aggression to a swift and
                                    positive cessation, and if, on a balance of political and
                                    military consideration, such use will best advance U.S. security
                                    interests. In the last analysis, if confronted by the choice of
                                    (a) acquiescing in Communist aggression or (b) taking measures
                                    risking either general war or loss of allied support, the United
                                    States must be prepared to take these risks if necessary for its

                                    Quemoy. Because Quemoy is so much tunneled for defense, there is

                                    doing itself. Therefore, he felt the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                        >Chinat</gloss>s should develop a fine counter-battery fire

                                        The Formosa airfields require local anti-aircraft defense

                                    interested in how fast <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                                    attacks in various forms might develop, if they develop at all,
                                    and also how long the situation can be ‘handled’ through
                                    employing <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> forces

                                    morning the President added to this that while the <gloss

                                    good reason for leaving Matsu and Quemoy, at the present time
                                    our concern must be in their defense. He indicated there is need
                                    for close analysis of alternatives and courses of action, and
                                    that I should observe as to these. He also indicated that he did
                                    not think he had ever met Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"

                            prospective effect on morale here if the offshore islands were lost. He
                            confirmed your impression that he had presented the matter in most
                            pessimistic terms, apparently to the extent of indicating that his
                            Government’s control over its own military forces would be jeopardized,
                            and its basis of popular support among Free Chinese perhaps irreparably
                            undermined. <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0389"/><persName

                            he did not suggest the extent to which it represented his own views.</p>
                        <p>I return to this subject because of the evident impression it had made on
                            you and on the Secretary, which first came to my attention during our
                            discussion in the plane flying up from Manila to Taipei on March 3.
                            Obviously we are dealing here with intangibles which do not lend
                            themselves to exact measurement or prediction. I most certainly would
                            not depreciate the psychological factors stressed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>; but while considering
                            the possibility that he may have exaggerated their importance, I believe
                            other factors are no less significant. Taken altogether these could well
                            place a substantially greater value upon retaining Kinmen and Matsu than
                            would result from giving primary emphasis to upholding morale on
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>In my brief review of the Chinese situation at the afternoon session in
                            Manila on March 2, I expressed the view that the loss of the offshore
                            islands would be “very serious but not necessarily disastrous”. The
                            precise effect, of course, would depend in considerable degree upon the
                            circumstances under which the loss occurred, and the events which might
                            follow in its wake. Subject to this obvious condition, however, I
                            continue to hold the opinion just quoted, which is the same that I
                            expressed to you and the Secretary on the following morning. This is
                            repeated here in the first instance because I believe it to be true, and
                            secondly because the present is not a time to burn bridges. I see no
                            adequate reason for losing Kinmen and Matsu, but if by some ill chance
                            they should be lost, whether by defeat or default, I should not want it
                            to serve anyone as a reason for pronouncing hopeless the cause of Free
                            China.</p>
                        <p>I hope that you and the Secretary did not carry away the impression that
                            I consider the retention of Kinmen and Matsu as less important than do
                            the Chinese. If anything, the contrary is true, despite the fact that I
                            am not inclined to subscribe fully to the case presented by <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>. It is not always easy to
                            evaluate Chinese thinking, as you know, particularly when it is so
                            largely influenced by what they think we are thinking. In terms of their
                            actions, it may be noted that the Chinese have never undertaken to
                            strengthen systematically and substantially the defenses of the offshore
                            islands, other than Kinmen, except in cases where we pressed them to do
                            so. This probably does not reflect the value which they place upon the
                            islands so much as it does the “pawn complex” which all of our smaller
                            and weaker allies develop in the course of time.</p>
                        <p>Probably much more serious to Free China’s morale than the loss of
                            additional small islands would be any formal steps toward the “two
                            Chinas” project. From the Chinese point of view, these might include the
                            entry of the Peiping regime into the United Nations and/or <pb n="362"
                                xml:id="pg_362" facs="0390"/>its recognition by the United States.
                            Any cease-fire, except possibly of definitely limited duration, would
                            have similar implications to them. Obviously, anything which would
                            indicate definitive United States acquiescence in the Communist conquest
                            of the Chinese Mainland would represent irretrievable disaster in Free
                            Chinese eyes. The loss of offshore islands as such undoubtedly would be
                            less important to President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> than the danger of the two Chinas idea which he
                            considers implicit in drawing a line down the Formosa Strait. I believe
                            that this must have been very much in <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s mind, and also in <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">George Yeh</persName>’s, when the matter was
                            first presented to you and to the Secretary in Washington. This may
                            explain the forcefulness of his presentation.</p>
                        <p>Among the most important arguments for retaining Kinmen and Matsu, it
                            seems to me, is the psychological effect on the enemy. It is almost
                            impossible to overestimate the danger of confirming the Reds in a belief
                            that, despite recent strong statements by the Secretary and others, we
                            are for peace at any price. Withdrawal from the Tachens undoubtedly
                            strengthened them in this belief. I have expressed to the Department my
                            opinion that a military engagement may well be necessary to convince the
                            enemy that we mean business. Such an engagement might have been risked
                            at the Tachens or at Nanchi. Resolutely handled, it presumably would
                            have been a localized affair, and might have given us several months of
                            peace in this area—a prospect which we do not now enjoy after the
                            Tachens and Nanchi have been given up and 20,000 more refugees created.
                            We still have opportunity to prepare for positive action at Kinmen and
                            Matsu.</p>
                        <p>On purely technical and immediate military grounds the surrender of the
                            Tachens probably was wise. Unfortunately, however, almost as good a case
                            could be made out for giving up Matsu and Kinmen, as Admiral
                                Spruance<note n="3" xml:id="d151fn3">Admiral Raymond A. Spruance
                                (retired), Ambassador to the Philippines.</note> and others, in
                            effect, have pointed out. It is true that our Navy had planned to occupy
                            the Amoy area, including Kinmen, as a base for operations against Taiwan
                            in World War II. On the other hand, it has been stated recently that we
                            would not bother with the Tachens if engaged in a full-scale war against
                            Red China. But for somewhat similar reasons we also decided to by-pass
                            Taiwan itself in World War II! And again, largely on technical military
                            grounds, we withdrew from South Korea, thereby making the Korean War
                            more or less inevitable.</p>
                        <p>All of which seems to confirm once more that major policy decisions
                            should not be based solely or even primarily upon technical military
                            considerations. Otherwise, in the interest of peace with all
                            concerned—including our own less imaginative military experts—we might
                            find in due course that the ramparts we watch in the Pacific <pb n="363"
                                xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"/>had been reestablished on a meridian
                            through Hawaii. Much more likely is that we should be at war again—on a
                            large scale but not necessarily World War III—because we finally found
                            ourselves compelled to make a stand somewhere west of Pearl Harbor
                            against the aggressor whom our successive withdrawals had made
                            increasingly bold. In the present case I believe that we should stop him
                            at Kinmen and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>This brings us to the practical question as to how these islands can be
                            held. I am glad to report that Matsu was reinforced last week, and that
                            four regiments are now stationed on that island group. This action
                            appears to have been taken as a direct result of the visits of the
                            Secretary and of Admirals <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>. It illustrates the
                            further point which I brought up in our discussion: the necessity of
                            letting the Chinese Government know clearly just what we want done in
                            military matters. Of course, they would have liked to hold all of the
                            offshore islands, but they do not feel strong enough to take such steps
                            without our full approval. In their view, we changed our position quite
                            suddenly with regard to defending the Tachens. They consider that we
                            reversed ourselves on various earlier occasions. Now, there is
                            considerable evidence that, despite successive “stand and die”
                            pronouncements, they will not expend any important part of their limited
                            military assets, except for the defense of Taiwan itself, without our
                            specific authorization and support. Hence the importance of letting them
                            know what we want done. Leadership in military matters must be our
                            responsibility. The pawn complex, to which I have referred, leaves us no
                            alternative.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps of more immediate importance than the ground defenses of Kinmen
                            and Matsu are the instructions under which the Seventh Fleet may operate
                            in the defense of these islands. If we are to keep hostilities
                            localized, it seems clear that Admiral <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1"
                                >Pride</persName> must have as much authority as was given him when
                            the Tachen evacuation began. In brief, whenever the Reds attack, whether
                            by air, by artillery bombardment or by amphibious operation, the Seventh
                            Fleet should react at once. This might involve no more than the
                            employment of Chinese naval and air units placed at <persName
                                corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName>’s disposal, but he should have
                            the authority to do on each occasion whatever is necessary to hurt the
                            enemy more than they have just hurt our Chinese allies in the particular
                            attack for which we are retaliating. One or two such engagements,
                            quickly and effectively carried out on our side, should restore the
                            relative stability which obtained along the offshore islands from July
                            1953 until September 1954. This is based upon the assumption that the
                            Reds do not want a real war at the present time any more than we do;
                            hence that they probably will not undertake any large scale offensive
                            operations against the offshore islands if they think that the United
                            States is likely to oppose them.</p>
                        <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0392"/>
                        <p>To the Communists the offshore islands as such do not seem to be worth a
                            fight with the United States. If and when the enemy attacks in force,
                            therefore, we may assume either that he does not expect us to intervene,
                            and that the islands can be had cheaply, or that his action is a
                            definite prelude to an assault on Taiwan regardless of consequences.
                            Certainly if Kinmen and Matsu should fall in a manner to reveal weakness
                            or hesitation on the part of the Chinese Nationalists and ourselves, an
                            attack on Taiwan would seem inevitable.</p>
                        <p>The visit of the Secretary and yourself was most helpful and I enjoyed
                            the opportunity of seeing more of you than I had before.</p>

                                    145</ref>.</note> regarding our desire to move ahead with the
                            Security Council Resolution. <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> opened by saying that London was fairly unhappy
                            over this proposal. Whereas the British agreed that the present lull was
                            no true index of the Chinese Communists’ ultimate intentions, they
                            believe that there is some reason to think that the present uneasy
                            situation may suit the Communists’ purposes in that they may calculate
                            that it places the maximum strain on US–<gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> relations. To disturb the lull by instituting action in
                            the Security Council might <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0393"
                            />arouse the Chinese Communists to take major military action against
                            the off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>Insofar as the Soviets are concerned, the Ambassador went on, somewhat
                            the same situation may prevail as with the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss>. In other words, the Soviets may feel that as long as
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> is in some contact with them on
                            the situation, they feel in a better position to use a restraining
                            influence on Peiping. Action in the Security Council presumably would
                            break off the existing rather tenuous contact between the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and Moscow on this subject. Moreover, the
                            Ambassador said, London was in doubt as to what might be gained by
                            Security Council action at this point and where one would go if, as
                            seemed inevitable, the Resolution was vetoed by the Soviets. One might
                            go to the General Assembly thereafter but it was hard to see where that
                            would lead. Moreover, if the Resolution were put in, the British of
                            course would vote for it and then might find themselves later in a
                            position of being hooked to defend <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> on Quemoy if there was a demand for further
                            action. They are anxious to avoid being pushed into a position of open
                            disagreement with us in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then said that his government could well understand the
                            President’s desire to seek further action through the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. He would like further informally to make
                            a suggestion which seemed the least unattractive of various
                            possibilities. This would be to have the Security Council ask three
                            powers—the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, India, and the Soviet
                            Union—to explore the situation further. He felt that this would put the
                            maximum pressure on Peiping. He asked that the Secretary give the
                            suggestion some thought.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he would think it over but that it did not
                            strike him favorably. For one thing an invitation to explore the matter
                            further would run counter to the agreement among the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, New Zealand and the United States that
                            they would resist an extension of the area of discussion in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> beyond the search for the cease-fire. A
                            group of the composition suggested would almost inevitably lead to such
                            a widened discussion. They would be in the position of intermediaries.
                            Furthermore, all three of these governments recognized Peiping, which is
                            not true of either the United States or the majority of the members of
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Group would be loaded against
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. A narrow
                            mandate to secure a cease-fire would be somewhat different but then
                            there would be need for the exercise of influence over <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, which influence this
                            suggested group obviously lacked. He would however consider the
                            matter.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then went on to say that on the basic issue of the
                            necessity of defending Formosa there is no real difference between the
                            US and the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>. We differ on Quemoy, it is
                            true. We recognize <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> as having a proper title to the off-shore
                            islands he <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0394"/>holds. The British,
                            on the other hand, think the off-shore islands belong to the Peiping
                            Government. The Secretary emphasized that our only interest in the
                            off-shore islands is their relevance to the defense of Formosa. The
                            President has made no final decision on this. It involves a factual
                            judgment. He added that if there were explicit or implicit disavowal by
                            the Chinese Communists of their currently expressed intention to take
                            Formosa by force, then our interest in the off-shore islands would
                            greatly change.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that as a casual thought he wondered whether time
                            would permit Security Council action after a large-scale attack was
                            launched by the Communists. There was some brief discussion of <persName
                                corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName>’s analysis of Communists’
                            intentions and the Secretary then said that from many indications,
                            including <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName>’s analysis and
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s remark to the
                            Finnish Ambassador in Peiping, he was inclined to think that the Chinese
                            Communists wanted a major show-down. He was concerned that this
                            show-down might be sought in Southeast Asia rather than in Formosa.</p>
                        <p>As the Ambassador left, the Secretary asked if he could have the text of
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s original note to the
                            Soviets of around February 25 or 26 which had been worked on at Bangkok.
                            The Ambassador promised to supply a copy.<note n="3" xml:id="d152fn3"

                            about 25 March it would take an “all-out” Communist attack against
                            Quemoy and Matsu to succeed against <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss> opposition alone. (By “all-out” they mean a
                            coordinated amphibious, artillery, air supported attack.) Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> is of the opinion that
                            such an all-out attack will not occur until after at least four weeks
                            from now in the case of Matsu, and eight weeks from now in the case of
                            Quemoy. During the next ten days while defenses are being built by the
                            regular division now on Matsu, a sudden <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss> amphibious attack might be sufficient.</p>

                            evaluate the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> artillery threat
                            to Matsu and Quemoy as harrassing but not critical—they do not believe
                            supply can be cut off. They do not believe that <gloss

                            near future can be, effective. MTB’s in <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss> hands <hi rend="italic">could</hi> threaten supply
                            operations, but there has been no sign of their use as yet.</p>
                        <p>In Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>’s opinion, the
                            location and strength of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> air
                            is the key determinant of their capability, and also of the necessity
                            for U.S. intervention. Without redeploying air forces in strength, there
                            is a good chance that any <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            attack could be held by <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> forces
                            alone, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>
                            considers that <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> action
                            supported by U.S. <hi rend="italic">conventional</hi> operations would
                            give a high degree of assurance against loss of the islands. If,
                            however, the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s move air forces
                            in strength into the area, the U.S. would have to be prepared to employ
                            atomic weapons before or as soon as the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s employ their air against <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss> forces or U.S. fleet elements.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> rates our
                            intelligence as good concerning <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss> air strength and location, but poor as to build up
                            of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> assault forces. It is
                            particularly hard to evaluate whether fishing junks are assembling for
                            an amphibious attempt or are simply following their normal pursuits.</p>
                        <p>Improvements are needed—and are going forward at varying rates—in
                            Formosan air defense; communications; coordination and command
                            arrangements; and intelligence. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Stump</persName> believes it will be necessary to advise <persName

                            and effective defense is to be created.</p>
                        <p>There is a good understanding of, and deference toward, the special time

                        <p>Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> opened the
                            conversation by asking the Secretary to outline the area of differences
                            between his position and that of Australian Foreign Minister Casey and
                            of <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> with reference to Formosa
                            and the offshore islands. The Secretary replied that the differences
                            were compounded of two elements. First, a misunderstanding of the United
                            States approach to the problem and, second, the question of judgment as
                            to the best way of achieving the same objective.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said there cannot be at this time a categoric assertion
                            that we are or will not defend Matsu and Quemoy Islands. Under the
                            Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China, our obligation is to
                            defend only Formosa and the Pescadores. The Senate Resolution (<gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 4) gives the President authority and
                            discretion to defend such related areas as he considers to be necessary
                            to the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. It was not possible to say
                            in advance what kind of action by the Red Chinese may be judged as the
                            beginning of an attack on Formosa. Under present conditions, with Red
                            propaganda emphasising that the “liberation of Formosa” is the objective
                            of its present action, it would be difficult to say that an attack on
                            Quemoy and Matsu was not in fact the predecessor of an attack upon
                            Formosa. When there is a change in these circumstances, we have no
                            obligation to defend the islands per se. The Secretary stated that he
                            felt sure that <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> understood
                            the United States position but that it seemed to be difficult for the
                            English Public to do so.</p>
                        <p>In the second place, it seems to be the feeling in the House of Commons
                            that the defense of Formosa could never be aided by the defense of
                            Quemoy and Matsu and therefore these islands should be <pb n="369"
                                xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>promptly given over to the Communists.
                            It is all very well, said the Secretary, to speak of putting 100 miles
                            of blue water between the Red Chinese and the United States on Formosa
                            but it would be even safer in the eyes of United States isolationists if
                            we put 6500 miles of blue water between the Red Chinese and the United
                            States. If it were possible to renounce the islands with no other
                            factors involved, that would be one thing, but in reality we could not
                            ignore the psychological effect upon the Army and Government of the
                            National Republic of China which would be involved in a succession of
                            retreats in the face of Communist threats. Furthermore, the mainland of
                            China is the ancestral home of the Chinese on Formosa. Hope of being
                            able to return is a tremendous factor in maintaining morale. Any action
                            fostering a spirit of defeatism and loss of hope might well be the cause
                            of serious defection both in the army and possibly in some elements of
                            Government. The United States does not have the troops to take the place
                            of those on Formosa and it is essential that we do everthing possible to
                            bolster and maintain the morale of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>, his troops and his government.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the political rivalry on Formosa and mentioned
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>’s son <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName> as the possible
                            leader of anti-American defection. (<persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> does not agree with <gloss target="#t_CIA1"
                                >CIA</gloss> intelligence casting doubt upon <persName
                                corresp="#p_CCLG1">Chiang Ching-kuo</persName>’s allegiance to the
                            free world nor does Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"
                                >Rankin</persName>.)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to his conversation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> dealing with the role of Free
                            China in which he emphasized that in his opinion the constant talk about
                            an armed reconquest of the mainland minimized the continuing and
                            important role that his government must be prepared to play.
                            Opportunities might arise and probably would arise but they could not be
                            created by the Republic of China alone. Rather, they probably would be
                            created by happenings on the mainland, such as, splits between the
                            Communist leaders as had taken place in Soviet Russia, the possibility
                            that the Chinese people might be goaded into revolt and the further
                            possibility that Chinese Communist aggression might precipitate a
                            general war against China. <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            agreed with this reasoning and that his government must be kept strong
                            in order to take advantage of such eventualities but stated that this
                            long-range approach presented a most difficult problem from the morale
                            standpoint.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary went on to emphasize to <persName corresp="#p_MRG1"
                                >Menzies</persName> the effect which a succession of withdrawals
                            might have upon the morale on Formosa and the possibility of being faced
                            with a situation which would make difficult the defense of Formosa
                            itself. Under present circumstances, he pointed out, we cannot take a
                            positive position as to what we will defend and will not defend. It
                            seemed to us that the British were inclined to look at the problem from
                            the military viewpoint alone, despite <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370"
                                facs="0398"/>these very real political and psychological aspects.
                            Everyone should now understand, said the Secretary, that we do not want
                            to get into a war with Communist China. We were in one in Korea and took
                            great pains to get out. However, we intend to defend Formosa and it
                            seems to us that our friends should be willing to accept our judgment as
                            to the best method of doing so.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> stated that he wished to
                            clear up two points. One, <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                            >Chiang</persName>’s army was sometimes referred to as an aging army.
                            Does this mean that there are no recruits? The Secretary replied that
                            until recently this was true but now recruiting was being made from the
                            Formosans. Both agreed that this was a stabilizing factor. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName>’ second question was what would
                            be the effect on the morale of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s forces if, as a quid pro quo for giving up the
                            Offshore Islands, a group of nations joined with the United States in
                            guaranteeing the defense of Formosa. The Secretary replied that he had
                            suggested a similar proposition to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> but had had no response. The Secretary asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> his opinion as to
                            the effect on morale. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            replied that as the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> recognized Red
                            China as the legal government of China, <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> might interpret such an arrangement as limiting
                            his role to Formosa and for this reason, he thought that the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> would be opposed. The
                            Secretary, however, said that if the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>,
                            Australia and New Zealand would join with the United States in
                            guaranteeing Formosa, this might perhaps enable <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> to give up the Offshore Islands.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> thought that such an
                            arrangement should help <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s
                            morale in that it would be assurance that the fall of the Islands would
                            not be a first step to the fall of Formosa but in reality would
                            represent the last step which the Red Chinese could take. The Secretary
                            agreed with <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> that the
                            Islands were vulnerable to attack and stated that in his opinion they
                            could not, in the last analysis, be held without the use of atomic
                            weapons. Certainly, if the Islands could be abandoned without seriously
                            affecting morale, it would be highly desirable to do so.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reiterated again that constant retreat was likely to have a
                            disastrous effect not only upon the morale of Formosa but upon public
                            opinion of all Southeast Asia as well, citing the uneasiness created in
                            the Philippines and Magsaysay’s statement that he could not accept
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s invitation
                            to visit the US during the Formosa crisis. The Secretary said he had
                            been thinking hard of some way to offset the unsatisfactory aspects of
                            the situation and he thought <persName corresp="#p_MRG1"
                                >Menzies</persName>’ suggestion had merit. Did he (<persName
                                corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName>) think the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would be likely to go along? He, the
                            Secretary, did not think so. <persName corresp="#p_MRG1"
                                >Menzies</persName> agreed saying that he thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s political opposition at home
                            would prevent his doing so at the present time.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_SSPC1">Spender</persName> asked if there
                            was any evidence of a buildup around Matsu and Quemoy. The Secretary
                            replied that guns were <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0399"/>being
                            moved into position around Quemoy but there was no great indication of
                            preparation for an immediate invasion. As to the Matsu Islands, the Reds
                            were apparently bringing into position long-range Russian guns which
                            could reach the Islands.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would like to give further thought to
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName>’ suggestion.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> emphasized that while
                            public opinion in Australia would likely be in favor of holding Formosa,
                            there would be no support for going to war over the islands. He was
                            impressed, however, with the Secretary’s point that the morale factor
                            not only involved Formosa but Indochina, Malaya and all Southeast Asia,
                            as well.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was impressed on this last trip by the fear
                            which had been inspired by the power of Communist China.</p>
                        <p>A discussion followed as to the military capability of Red China.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> said he thought
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1">Churchill</persName> under-estimated
                            its strength whereas countries around the perimeter over-estimated
                            it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the different problems posed by public opinion
                            in the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, Australia, and the United
                            States. <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> said that
                            Australian opinion would support a war fought in the defense of freedom.
                            There would be no support for a war in support of governments per se and
                            certainly no support for going to war over the offshore Islands. The
                            Secretary replied that the United States is not going to fight for
                            Quemoy and Matsu either. Whatever we do will be done as part of our
                            defense of Formosa. <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> said
                            that he understood our position and further, if the United States gets
                            involved in a great war, we could count on Australia being in it too.
                            But, he said, there is a great difference in reaching that position by
                            the full support of public opinion and of getting into the war with a
                            half-hearted support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked what would be the feeling in Australia on the
                            question of a blockade of the China coast as a possible substitute for
                            the defense of Matsu and Quemoy. He pointed out the serious situation
                            posed by the <hi rend="italic">Aruba</hi> with jet fuel oil and 36 other
                            vessels now on the way to Red China ports with strategic war materials.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> asked if we would
                            propose to indicate to <persName corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> that if
                            he attempted to take the islands by force we would impose a blockade.
                            The Secretary said that might be one consideration but we might also
                            suggest to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> a blockade in
                            lieu of a defense of the islands. Tange inquired whether this would be
                            an act of belligerency or whether it could be based on the <gloss

                        <p>On March 15, New Zealand Ambassador Leslie K. Munro and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> discussed possible

                                >Makins</persName> on March 14 (see <ref target="#d152">Document

                                >Dulles</persName> commented that while the United States would of

                            would “look with favor on a commission all the members of which
                            recognized the Chinese Communists.” He stated that the Department had
                            not yet decided whether to proceed with the United Nations resolution in
                            light of the British opposition to doing so. He observed that “as
                            between pressing the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> for action on the
                            one hand or letting the matter coast along for a further period, the
                            question could of course be raised as to what new element had arisen
                            which required urgent action. Communist Chinese propaganda had
                            diminished a considerable amount of late: the volume of propaganda about
                            Formosa had dropped from about 20% to about 5%. It was perhaps not a
                            particularly significant development except that the Chinese Reds would
                            presumably precede any armed attack with a heavy volume of propaganda.”

                            galvanize the Security Council into action on a resolution after an
                            attack had been launched on the off-shore islands or after it became
                            clearly apparent that one was impending.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reminded <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName>
                            of the very great interest that New Zealand seemed to have in pressing
                            ahead with the Resolution now. He said that on the question of timing he
                            would like to consider the matter further and that he would endeavor to
                            give a further answer to <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> on Monday or Tuesday<note n="3" xml:id="d156fn3"
                                >March 21 or 22.</note> of next week.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that the British could take it as definite that
                            their informal proposal for the establishment by the Security Council of
                            a group composed of the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> and India to examine into the
                            Formosan situation was not agreeable to the U.S.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> suggested that it might
                            be possible to confine their terms of reference to the exploration of
                            the possibility of a cease-fire. The Secretary gave him no encouragement
                            whatsoever and merely observed that the Chinese Nationalists were
                            themselves strongly opposed to a cease-fire and that the group of three
                            suggested had no influence with the Republic of China. He added that we
                            were prepared to police a cease-fire if it were obtained and felt that
                            this was possible by reason of our exchange of notes with the
                            Nationalists and their dependence on us for supplies. Clearly, the three
                            governments suggested were in no position to accomplish any such
                            policing themselves. On the other hand, if the three powers suggested
                            could successfully exert their influence on the Chinese Communists, then
                            we could exert an influence on the Nationalists. Any position for them
                            as intermediaries was totally unacceptable.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> then said he had been
                            interested in his last talk with the Secretary in the expression by the
                            latter of his views on Chinese Communist intentions, particularly with
                            respect to Southeast Asia. He was therefore handing the Secretary a
                            brief memorandum of the British appreciation on this matter.

                        <p rend="center">UNITED KINGDOM APPRECIATION OF FAR EASTERN SITUATION</p>
                        <p>Our own reading of the position is as follows. We agree that the Chinese
                            Communists will not accept the retention of Formosa by the Nationalists;
                            but it is our belief that given the clear United States determination to
                            defend Formosa (and the Pescadores) they will not in fact contest the
                            issue by force. In South East Asia the situation is not unsatisfactory
                            from the Chinese point of view and there would seem little advantage for
                            them to launch an attack and thus lay themselves open to probable
                            retaliation by the Manila Treaty powers. It will surely suit them better
                            to try to win over Asian opinion and lull <pb n="375" xml:id="pg_375"
                                facs="0403"/>Asian suspicions by appearing moderate and peace-loving
                            while at the same time pursuing their objectives under cover. The
                            Bandung Conference will give them an opportunity to mobilise Asian
                            opinion on their side in favour of such aims as non-interference,
                            respect for national sovereignty etc. They must know that they cannot
                            take on the U.S.A. in open war with nuclear weapons. Their objective
                            seems more likely to be to isolate the U.S.A. and to consolidate opinion
                            on their side.</p>
                        <p>Therefore instead of our being faced with a showdown, the prospect in the
                            Far East seems to us more likely to be a long drawn-out struggle for the
                            support of Asia accompanied by Communist subversion and the constant
                            threat of war. There may always be an explosion, but it seems to us that
                            that would be more likely to come at present from miscalculation than
                            deliberate policy on the part of the Chinese.</p>
                        <p>That is why in our view it is so important to exercise moderation in our
                            statements and attitudes lest we frighten the Asians into China’s arms.
                            This is also one of the reasons why we would like to see the coastal
                            islands evacuated. We agree with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> that our difference on this question is a matter
                            of factual judgment rather than principle. But our judgment is based not
                            only on the military case for evacuation, but also on the fact that the
                            American position would be easier to justify vis-à-vis world and Asian
                            opinion were these islands not in question.</p>

                                    within these groups. They will seek to erode Nationalist ability

                                            extent of a possible US counteraction to an attempt at
                                            seizure, they might consider that they could overrun

                            <item>It may not be possible for the Chinese Communists, as a result of
                                their probing actions alone, to ascertain the full extent of a
                                possible US counteraction to an attempt at seizure of an offshore
                                island. If the US did not respond to initial probing actions, the
                                Chinese Communists might estimate that the US would not in fact
                                commit its own forces to the defense of the island. Or, even though
                                there was some US military reaction to a probing attack, the Chinese
                                Communists might still estimate that US counteraction to an actual
                                invasion of offshore islands would remain limited and localized. Or,
                                the Chinese Communists might estimate that they could overrun an
                                offshore island before effective US counteraction could be brought
                                to bear and that the US would not subsequently initiate major
                                hostilities in order to regain the captured territory. In any of
                                these circumstances, we believe the Chinese Communists would

                                            for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, and the Director of
                                            Naval Intelligence believe that this paragraph should
                                            read as follows:</p>
                                        <p>“Should the conflict progress so far that the Communists
                                            believed the existence of the Chinese Communist regime
                                            was gravely threatened, we believe that the Soviet
                                            leaders would recognize that open intervention on their
                                            part against US forces sufficient to save the Chinese
                                            regime would involve grave risk of general war with the
                                            US. Their decision would probably be based on existing
                                            military, political, and economic strengths, with
                                            particular emphasis on the current disparities in
                                            nuclear stockpiles and delivery capabilities. We believe
                                            that the Soviet leaders would probably conclude that if
                                            they intervened the conflict could not be confined to
                                            the Far East, and that Soviet strengths were
                                            insufficient to risk their own regime in this manner.”

                            <item>The reaction of most non-Communist governments to US defense of
                                Taiwan would in general be favorable. The reaction of most
                                non-Communist governments to US action in defense of the offshore
                                islands, or to US attacks on Chinese Communist military
                                concentrations prior to a Communist attack, would be unfavorable. If
                                the US bombed military targets throughout east China, non-Communist
                                reactions would be considerably more unfavorable, reflecting a fear
                                of the immediacy of general war. Even in these circumstances,
                                however, and despite increased strains between the US and its
                                allies, we believe existing US alliances would remain intact.
                                However, if the US became involved in defense of the offshore
                                islands before the ratification of the Paris agreements, the
                                ratification might be jeopardized. <hi rend="italic">(Paras. 48–56,

                                            stop an actual invasion to Taiwan and that the US was

                                    The general reaction of non-Communist Asians would be emotional
                                    and would be extremely critical of the US. In the case of Japan,
                                    the Government would probably attempt to steer a more neutral

                                Peiping’s propaganda has continued to suggest that further
                                preparations are necessary before a full-scale operation against
                                Formosa and the Pescadores can be launched. The Chinese Communists
                                are regarded as capable, however, of attacking the remaining
                                Nationalist-held offshore islands with little or no warning.</item>

                            <item>The Chinese Communists are clearly conducting a psychological
                                warfare effort against the Chinese Nationalists, parallel with the
                                military effort, as was the pattern in Communist operations during
                                the civil war on the mainland. Since last July Chinese Communist
                                propaganda directed at Formosa—at Nationalist leaders, Nationalist
                                armed forces, the Nationalist bureaucracy, and the Formosans
                                themselves—has greatly increased. It seems probable that Communist
                                efforts to infiltrate Formosa have increased in the same
                                period.</item>

                            <item>There are other actions within Communist capabilities, prior to an
                                all-out military effort against Formosa and the Pescadores, which
                                could increase Nationalist vulnerability to subversion. Among these
                                are the capture of additional offshore islands, air attacks on
                                Formosa, and the assassination of Nationalist leaders (possibly

                            <item>The Chinese Communists themselves apparently expect their
                                subversive efforts to play an important part in Formosa’s eventual
                                “liberation.” Communist spokesmen have said both privately and
                                publicly in recent months that they believe the island will fall
                                through a combination of Communist military action and internal
                                uprisings. Peiping is apparently attempting to create, well in
                                advance of a military assault, the conditions which would produce
                                such uprisings at the time of an assault.</item>

                            <item>Since 1949 the hope for a “return to the mainland” has been an
                                important cohesive factor among the Chinese Nationalists. This hope
                                has almost certainly been dimmed since last December, as there have
                                been several developments which the Nationalists must interpret as
                                meaning that the United States does not intend to provide the heavy
                                support required for a large-scale Nationalist operation against the
                                mainland. International pressure for a cease-fire in the China area
                                has been greatly intensified. Taipei has lost one of its three major
                                island groups, and the remaining islands are threatened.</item>

                            <item>Another factor which could promote disaffection is the chronic
                                surplus of both civil officials and military officers, particularly
                                in the higher ranks. This entails the enforced inaction of many men
                                who held important positions on the mainland, and the frustration of
                                many competent younger persons.</item>
                            <label>11.</label>
                            <item>Another basic factor is the continued austerity of life on
                                Formosa. Although general living conditions are well above the Asian
                                standard, they are not comfortable for the great majority. Economic
                                conditions will deteriorate steadily as the population grows and per
                                capita productivity declines, and conditions could become
                                drastically worse in the event of an inflationary spurt. While all
                                levels of Nationalist military and civil officialdom are probably
                                aware that conditions are hard on the mainland too, many may believe
                                that privation in Communist China would be more tolerable due to
                                apparent progress toward national goals.</item>

                                the middle and lower levels of the bureaucracy and the younger army
                                officers, including field grade officers now commanding regiments
                                and in some cases divisions. These elements would also seem capable

                                and the continued good health and activity of many onetime
                                Nationalist leaders now associated with the Peiping regime—that they
                                might conclude a mutually profitable agreement with Peiping.</item>

                            <item>The enlisted ranks of the Nationalist armed forces would also seem
                                to constitute a worthwhile target for Communist subversion, despite
                                their continual indoctrination and surveillance by Nationalist
                                political officers. There is no current evidence of widespread
                                disaffection in the ranks. However, one ex-Nationalist leader
                                asserts <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0411"/>that there are

                                Communist airborne invasion, such Nationalist dissidents would
                                assassinate their leaders and join forces with the
                                Communists.</item>

                            <item>The native Formosans, who outnumber the Nationalists from the
                                mainland about four to one (eight million to two million), would
                                also seem potentially vulnerable to subversion. Although relations
                                between the Nationalists and the Formosans have greatly improved in
                                recent years as a result of reforms, resentment of Nationalist
                                brutality and misrule prior to 1950 is believed to be still strong
                                in some Formosan circles. The Nationalists continue to treat the
                                Formosans as second-class citizens in many respects, and the costs
                                of government continue to press most heavily on the Formosans. The
                                declining prospects of a Nationalist return to the mainland may well
                                stimulate the Formosans to seek an alternative to Nationalist

                                serious, and the number of defections may rise sharply. Communist
                                subversive efforts may also increase appreciably, and indeed may
                                already have increased, without a reflection of such increase in
                                Nationalist figures. The current figures may in fact reflect less a
                                decline in subversion than continuing ineffectiveness on the part of

                                <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> raised the
                                    question of whether or not it would not be better to get out of
                                    Quemoy and Matsu. I repeated that from a ‘map’ standpoint this
                                    had advantages but that I could not give any assurance that such
                                    a withdrawal could be practically effected at the present time,
                                    while at the same time not making the loss of Formosa much more
                                    likely because of internal factors. If the Chinese Communists
                                    gave time, then a new situation might perhaps be brought about.
                                    I was already working with the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                        >Generalissimo</persName> to try to change the psychology of
                                    the National Government. Also, Formosan Chinese were more and
                                    more being brought into the Army, and if that happened, there
                                    would be more interest in the defense of Formosa and less
                                    interest in going back to the Mainland. However, this transition
                                    required time, and I did not know the Chinese Communists would
                                    give us that time. So far, they had given every evidence of
                                    pressing on to the conquest of Formosa itself and were
                                    contemptuous of a settlement which might draw a line through the

                        <p>The determination of the Chinese Communists to destroy the Nationalist
                            Government and incorporate Formosa and the off-shore islands into the
                            Chinese Communist political system has been publicly reiterated and is
                            now reflected in the increasingly tense Formosa situation. Because of
                            the Chinese Communist mentality and the announced U.S. policies
                            regarding Formosa, the Pescadores and the offshore islands, there exists
                            a real probability of war with Communist China.</p>

                            seriousness of its intentions, then possibly the Chinese Communists
                            would be deterred from actions which would lead to war.</p>
                        <p>In analyzing the problem at this time the following assumptions can be

                            no further action on <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>, we run risk of
                            having public lose sight of fact that Communist aggressive posture is
                            real source of threat to peace in Formosa area and that we are all bound
                            by <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Charter to settle disputes by
                            peaceful methods. Surely a cease-fire is the essential first step when
                            shots are being exchanged.</p>
                        <p>For our part we would much prefer to secure prompt vote on New Zealand
                            resolution even assuming Soviet veto, in which case it would be
                            perfectly clear who opposes cease-fire proposal. I appreciate <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> reluctance carry matters this far at
                            present stage. I do however feel we can gain benefit from another
                            Security Council posting before Soviet representative takes chair. At
                            such meeting New Zealand representative would introduce resolution and
                            we would all speak to it so as to emphasize our common desire for a
                            cease-fire and our hope that, if our restraint is matched by Communists,
                            hostilities could be avoided. We would not put resolution to immediate
                            vote if <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> opposed.</p>
                        <p>I believe New Zealand would agree to this procedure and I hope you will
                            likewise comment so that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> delegations
                            New York can make necessary tactical arrangements for meeting before

                            <item>This subject has been discussed at length recently by high U.S.
                                officials with you and I am sure there is a common understanding of

                            <item>The next few months, or even weeks, may be most critical and I
                                strongly feel that every effort must be given to improving the air
                                defense of Taiwan and the Pescadores, and the defensive capability
                                of the off-shore islands. These projects should receive the highest
                                priority in manpower, material and equipment, money and planning
                                effort. Naturally only your best qualified troops and commanders
                                should be entrusted with the defense of the off-shore islands. They
                                are the advance guard of the free world against Communism, and
                                should have the importance of their task forcefully pointed out to
                                them. When the attack comes, it is of utmost importance that your
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> forces conduct prompt and
                                forceful defense operations to include aggressive employment of your
                                air and naval forces. It is my opinion that U.S. actions (which are
                                necessarily influenced by popular opinion of the citizens of the
                                U.S.) will depend to a large degree on the vigor with which your
                                forces conduct their all-out defense. I regret that I cannot assure
                                you that U.S. Forces will participate in the defense of the
                                off-shore islands, but as you know the U.S. Pacific <pb n="389"

                                prepared to do so promptly, if directed by higher U.S.

                            <item>In support of the defense it is of utmost importance that your
                                    <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> reconnaissance operations be
                                expanded to include daily close scrutiny of Communist airfields and

                            discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            inquired as to the likelihood that the Chinese Communists might
                            eventually renounce their attempts to seize these offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the opinion that the Chinese Communists would in
                            all probability not renounce such attempts, and that we should make up
                            our minds to live with the problem. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said that the situation might
                            change after a period of perhaps ten years, when native Formosans would
                            largely have replaced mainland Chinese in the Chinese Nationalist
                            armies. These Formosans would be much more concerned with defending
                            Formosa than with defending the offshore islands. The Chinese
                            Communists, moreover, would have less fear of an attack by Formosans on
                            the Communist mainland.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> asked whether it
                            would not be desirable to have a study prepared as to ways and means of
                            destroying the big guns and gun emplacements on the Chinese mainland
                            opposite the offshore islands. No such attempt to destroy these gun
                            emplacements would, of course, take place until after the ratification
                            of the Paris agreements, and the effort would be made with conventional
                            rather than with nuclear weapons. The President expressed the opinion
                            that it would be next to impossible to take out these gun emplacements
                            without resort to nuclear weapons. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> expressed hearty agreement with the President’s
                            opinion on this point.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> resumed his
                            intelligence briefing with a brief resume of petroleum shipments to
                            Communist China during the year 1954. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> inquired whether we knew with
                            what the Chinese Communists were paying the Soviets for goods supplied
                            to them. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> replied
                            that it was apparently done by a lend-lease arrangement. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that the
                            Chinese paid back the Russians chiefly in raw materials.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then called on Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> for any remarks he
                            wished to make on the military situation in the Formosa area.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed the
                            opinion that the fact that we have so little operational intelligence
                            regarding the Chinese Communist build-up for an assault on the offshore
                            islands, should not be taken to mean that such a build-up is not going
                            on. For example, the mainland airfields could be made ready for use in a
                            very few days in so far as the runways are concerned. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> thought that the Chinese
                            Communists were moving in jet fuel and other supplies to these bases,
                            even though such activities were not actually revealed by photo
                            reconnaissance. Accordingly, he concluded, we must assume that the
                            Chinese Communists are getting ready just as fast as they can.</p>

                            three days ago.<note n="2" xml:id="d165fn2">In remarks made at the
                                Advertising Club of New York on March 21, Secretary <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> declared that the
                                “aggressive fanaticism” of the Chinese Communist leaders contrasted
                                with the “coldly calculated and deliberate” steps of Soviet
                                expansion and that while in the long run the latter might prove more
                                formidable, in the short run, the Chinese method might prove “more
                                dangerous and provocative of war.” It was necessary, he said, to
                                peacefully bring the Chinese Communists to realize that the
                                “restraint and patience of the free nations” stemmed not from
                                weakness or fear but from strength and resolution. For text of the
                                statement, see Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                April 4, 1955, pp. 551–552.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said he had seen press accounts but had not read
                            the text. The Secretary said he had made it clear that the choice of war
                            or peace rested with Peking. The United States had stated publicly on
                            several occasions that it would not concur in the use of force in an
                            aggressive manner and had obtained a commitment from <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> that the latter would
                            not undertake military operations against the mainland without American
                            concurrence. The Secretary added that the United States had made it
                            equally clear that military action by the Chinese Reds directed against
                            Taiwan would be resisted. Hence peace could be had in the Orient if the
                            Reds wished—or they could cause a war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he recognized
                            fully that American public opinion was not prepared for a solution of
                            the “Formosa problem” over night. What he hoped was that talks could be
                            started. He thought that in order to make any progress direct but
                            informal contact would have to be established between Americans and the
                            Chinese Reds. He commented that a third party “might be useful” in this
                            connection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> expressed his very deep
                            concern over the situation in the Far East because of the repeated and
                            apparently genuine public statements by the Chinese Communists that they
                            intended to capture <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0421"/>Taiwan by
                            force. If they carried out this threat, fighting was inevitable. He
                            hoped very much the Chinese Reds would not do so</p>
                        <p>The discussion turned to Indochina. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said his Government was most anxious that
                            conversations between Southern and Northern Viet-Nam would begin in June
                            in preparation for the elections to be held next year. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he saw no reason why such
                            talks should not start and agreed that they should. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> would be most happy to
                            learn that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> felt this
                            way.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he believed the Chinese Reds constituted a greater
                            danger to world peace today than the Soviet Union. He described the
                            Soviets as chess players who calculated their moves in advance, whereas
                            the Chinese Reds, flushed with their successes in Korea, Indochina and
                            the offshore islands, seemed to be exhilarated and to exaggerate their
                            own power. This might constitute the greatest danger to the world at the
                            present time. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said
                            that he and his Government felt absolutely confident that the Peking
                            regime had no expansionist ambitions. He said the Chinese Reds
                            considered Formosa to be an integral part of China and were certainly
                            anxious to extend their control over that island but they regarded their
                            fight with <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> as a
                            civil war and not aggressive or expansionist. The Secretary pointed out
                            that Formosa had not been Chinese for the past sixty years, that the
                            United States had conquered it from Japan, and that the Peking
                            authorities were presumptuous in demanding that the territory which we
                            had won from Japan should be turned over by us to a regime openly
                            hostile to us. He said the Chinese people were generally supposed to
                            take a long view of history whereas Americans were supposed to be
                            impatient, but in the present instance it was Peking which was demanding
                            an immediate settlement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> mentioned the
                            imprisoned American flyers and referred casually to the Chinese students
                            in the United States who were said to desire to return to Red China. (In
                            a subsequent talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName>
                            he expanded on this theme, saying that one of these students had told
                            him in New York that from 200 to 500 such students wanted to return to
                            China but most of them did not like to say so openly because they had
                            jobs and did not wish to be branded as pro-communist unless they were
                            certain they would be able to return. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1"
                                >Allen</persName> expressed great doubt that any such number wanted
                            to go back.)</p>
                        <p>After the interview, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            expressed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> his
                            considerable satisfaction at the talk and said he felt confident that
                            tensions in the Far East would be relaxed if “people could be brought
                            together and start talking”.</p>

                                from <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>, informing
                                    <persName corresp="#p_LHC1">Lodge</persName> of a message he had
                                received from <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> in

                                message (summarized in <ref target="#d120">Document 120</ref>).
                                According to <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjöld</persName>’s
                                letter, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s message stated
                                that China’s handling of the case of the four flyers would not be
                                influenced by clamor in the United States, that it was unfortunate
                                that the families of the flyers had been prevented from coming to
                                China, and that he would inform the Secretary-General immediately as
                                soon as the case of the four flyers had been dealt with. (Department
                                of State, Central Files, 611.95A241/3–2355)</note> I asked him how
                            he interpreted this latest communication from <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> reiterated his
                            feeling, expressed in his letter, that the key to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s present attitude was that he
                            would inform <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> “immediately” as to the
                            results of the investigations on the four jet pilots. This seemed to
                            reinforce <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss>’s belief that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> would take action first on the
                            four. <gloss target="#t_SYG1">SYG</gloss> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s language re US, while still
                            derogatory, had become more civilized. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> said he had acknowledged receipt of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s latest communication
                            and in it had referred to the fact that he has received letters from the
                            families of the fliers, addressed to <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>, which he will shortly be forwarding together in a
                            package. He included this reference to the letters in order to keep up
                            what he called his psychological pressure on <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>. He did not want <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> to feel that if he takes action to release the four
                            jet pilots that that would end matters.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> said he saw a new
                            factor in this whole situation forthcoming at the Afro-Asian conference
                            at Bandung. He feels <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> is
                            clever enough to realize that he will be queried in private discussions
                            there by friends of US and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> about his
                            attitude on the prisoners. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> thought that it was quite possible that
                                <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> or <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> would raise this matter with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> at Bandung. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> has in fact been prodding
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> to get
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to exercise some
                            responsibility on this matter and to prod <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> with regard to it.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> regards the Bandung
                            Conference as an important step in the development of this matter. He
                            feels that the receipt of the letters from the families about the first
                            of April is well-timed, coming as it does just before Bandung. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> should, in his opinion, be ready to
                            act on the fliers by that time. If nothing has developed by the time the
                            Afro-Asian Conference is finished, however, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>
                            <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0423"/>feels that that would be the
                            proper moment for reassessing the utility of his approach in this
                            case.</p>
                        <p>This is the first time that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> has indicated to me any possibility of a
                            concrete deadline for the present phase of his activity on the fliers.
                            Since that possible deadline is only about a month from now, I recommend
                            that we cooperate with him to best of our ability in keeping public
                            temperatures down on this subject for another month. I told <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> that I was not as confident
                            as he appeared to be regarding <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s eagerness to move on the fliers matter.</p>

                            for which I thank you.</p>
                        <p>I quite recognise the force of your desire to explain the United States
                            position before the world and you have every right to do so. But I do
                            not think that a debate in the Security Council will make the position
                            any clearer or better from our point of view.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, I see immediate and serious danger if we were to press ahead
                            with <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> in the next few days. First,
                            attention would be focussed on Quemoy and Matsu. If the Nationalists
                            were prepared to offer to abandon these islands once a cease-fire were
                            agreed, that would indeed be a new element in the situation. But as
                            things stand now a move in the Security Council would tend to look
                            simply as though we were trying to guarantee <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s position in these islands. This was always a
                            danger in <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> but we could risk it while
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> was on its original basis and there
                            was a chance of the Chinese appearing before the Security Council. As
                            things are, however, there can be no doubt that public opinion in this
                            country certainly, and I believe in Asia as well, would not support
                            action that seemed designed to confirm <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName> in Quemoy and Matsu. Thus a further move
                            in the Security Council now instead of focussing attention on our desire
                            to have a cease-fire, might simply focus attention on the difference
                            between the United States on one hand and other free nations on the
                            other regarding the coastal islands.</p>
                        <p>There is a further point which <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1"
                                >Makins</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Scott</persName>
                            have already made to you, namely if we were to go ahead and the Russians
                            vetoed the New Zealand Resolution, what action could we then take? To
                            leave matters as a vetoed resolution would surely weaken the authority
                            of the Security Council and there would be demands for further action.
                            We agreed some time ago that action in the General Assembly might be
                            dangerous, but what other action could be taken in the United Nations? I
                            do not like the idea of going ahead without a clear understanding of
                            subsequent steps. The situation might be different if I thought that <hi
                                rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi> could still contribute to restraining
                            the Chinese from hostile action. But I do not think it can. Nor does
                            your message suggest that you think it might do so. As I read your
                            message your main object in going ahead with <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                >Oracle</hi> would be to put <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"
                            />the United States position before the rest of the world in the hope of
                            increasing support for it. But as I have already said above this is
                            surely possible without a political move in the Security Council. I have
                            a fear that the latter, instead of improving our position before the
                            Afro-Asian Conference might worsen it by alienating the Indians, Burmese
                            and others whose views may not be without influence in Peking. It also
                            seems unlikely to me that Soviet Presidency of the Security Council
                            would be an unsuperable bar to action in April if it became
                            necessary.</p>
                        <p>I am sorry to go on disagreeing with you about this question of the next
                            move. I can assure you that I have given it very serious thought and I
                            really do not see that to proceed with <hi rend="smallcaps">Oracle</hi>
                            at this stage would do any good and it might do much harm to the
                            relations between our two countries and to our common cause.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary replied that it was extremely difficult to appraise the
                            situation accurately: We were dependent on aerial photographs which in
                            the past had taken three or four weeks to be evaluated. Now the time has
                            been cut down to six days, which, however, is still too long. This time
                            lag has perhaps given an appearance of greater buildup than has actually
                            occurred. The present situation is that work of a military nature is
                            going forward methodically but without indication of any last-minute
                            haste. It looks, therefore, as if the Chinese Communists would not start
                            an attack until everything had been well prepared. Nevertheless, the
                            capabilities are there and it <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"
                            />would be possible for operations against the offshore islands to start
                            on short advance notice. Possibly the signs would not be clear until two
                            or three days before the actual attack. On the other hand, an attack
                            might be preceded by a long, protracted bombardment. Nobody could tell
                            for sure, but a guess would be that no attack would take place until
                            after the Bandung Conference is ended.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that earlier today that he had spoken with Mr.
                                <persName>Cameron</persName>, correspondent of the London <hi
                                rend="italic">News Chronicle</hi>, who had recently been in Peking.
                                <persName>Cameron</persName> had been deeply impressed by the
                            inflexible determination of the Chinese Communists to take Formosa. This
                            determination was so widespread and deep that he could not see how the
                            Chinese could abandon the idea. There was, therefore, not much reason to
                            hope that the Communists would not make a military attack.</p>
                        <p>. . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>With respect to artillery bombardments directed from the mainland, the
                            Secretary observed that of late these had been of a sporadic and not
                            very serious character.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> asked for the
                            Secretary’s reaction to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                            >Eden</persName>’s decision. The Secretary replied that the message<note

                            just been received and had not yet been studied, but he would say that
                            he was disappointed with it. He added that it would seem that perhaps
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Sir Anthony</persName> does not feel to
                            the same degree as do we that presentation of the case in the Security
                            Council might have a deterrent effect on the Chinese Communists.
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_MSL1">Munro</persName> agreed. The
                            Secretary feared that once the Chinese Communists return from the
                            Bandung Conference, they will proceed with an attack. In the meantime,
                            we will have lost a valuable opportunity to act because of British
                            opposition and fear that a debate would provoke the Chinese
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that before coming to a final decision as to the
                            course which we would wish to take he would wish to speak to the
                            President. Both … and the Secretary felt that if the Security Council is
                            to proceed with operation Oracle before April 1, notice would have to be
                            given not later than Monday, March 28, bearing in mind that the Security
                            Council was meeting on the Gaza item on Tuesday, March 29.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed to get in touch with the Ambassador as soon as we
                            had come to a decision.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> to him.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d170fn3">Not found in Department of State files, but see

                            draft memorandum, we were requested at the end of the meeting not to
                            take copies with us.) In essence, the draft memorandum contained
                            “suggestions” on steps to improve the situation and exercise a greater
                            deterrent effect against Chinese Communist action in the Formosa area.
                            There were the following three specific suggestions around which the
                            discussion centered: <list>

                                <label>2.</label>

                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> should take such
                                    further steps as are necessary to ensure the defense of
                                    Formosa.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The draft report of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> indicated
                            that its suggestions and views were based on the assumption that atomic
                            weapons would be used. General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1"
                                >Ridgway</persName> had not concurred in this assumption, but from
                            the draft paper it was not clear what General <persName
                                corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s views were since he did not
                            express a definite assumption with corresponding views. Also, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had suggested that
                            instead of secretly notifying the Chinese Communists through diplomatic
                            channels as to US determination to defend Quemoy and Matsu, the US
                            should make known publicly its views and position with regard to <pb
                                n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0429"/>the situation there. In other
                            words, General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>’s
                            proposal did not specifically recommend that we take a position to
                            defend Quemoy and Matsu, but it did not specifically say that we should
                                not.<note n="4" xml:id="d170fn4">General <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> stated in a memorandum of
                                March 26 to Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens that information
                                he had received the previous day appeared to establish that the
                                President had made a decision that any attack on the Quemoys or
                                Matsus would be considered the preliminary to an attack on Formosa,
                                thus automatically resulting in U.S. participation in their defense.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had therefore
                                concluded that: “the recommendation I had intended to make in the
                                strongest terms, to wit, ‘that United States armed forces NOT
                                participate in the defense of Quemoy or the Matsus, regardless of
                                the scale of attack’, would no longer be proper, since decision by
                                proper authority had already been made.” (United States Army
                                Military History Institute, <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1"
                                    >Ridgway</persName> Papers)</note> But, he seemed to imply that
                            we should clearly and publicly state our position.</p>
                        <p>In a general discussion that followed, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said there were two courses of
                            action which seemed open to us. On the one hand, should we speed up
                            taking certain actions which might bring the situation to a head? Such
                            actions might include letting the Chinese Nationalists operate against
                            the airfields build-up and against Communist shipping that was bringing
                            in strategic supplies, etc. Or, should we let the situation go along
                            very much as at present for a period of, say, sixty days, during which
                            the Bandung Conference would take place and we might be able to get the
                            European situation straightened out. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said his reaction was against
                            making any public statement or using diplomatic channels to say that we
                            would defend Quemoy and Matsu. He felt that any public statement that we
                            were suspending the proposed reduction in our force levels because of
                            the situation in the Far East would stir up a very considerable turmoil
                            in the Congress and in this country. He said that as a practical matter
                            he could take steps which would prevent the further reduction of forces
                            during this immediate period, but that he doubted the wisdom of a public
                            declaration in this sense. He discussed briefly the difficulties the
                            Army has encountered in reducing to the proposed force levels, and
                            pointed out the problems which are connected with such reductions if
                            hostilities subsequently occurred. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> said that if hostilities occurred he would not
                            immediately increase the Army but would concentrate on stepped up
                            aircraft production. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that this would not be sufficient and
                            that both aircraft production and the Army would have to be increased
                            simultaneously. With respect to the proposed force reductions, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said the President’s
                            presentation on the force levels as well as his own and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s had made clear that it was
                            predicated on the international situation not deteriorating. Since the
                            force levels had been established, the situation had deteriorated very
                            markedly in the Far East. Therefore, the Chiefs felt (as <pb n="402"
                                xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>was pointed out in the draft paper)
                            that the situation justified force levels at a higher level than had
                            been contemplated in the Administration’s plans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then said that
                            the very basis of all his thinking is how we can best prevent a war from
                            developing in the area. Commenting on the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> draft, he indicated that he doubted that the President
                            would wish to approve suggestion 1, above, since this would involve his
                            taking a position immediately on the defense of Quemoy and Matsu,
                            whereas he believed the President did not wish to take this decision
                            until a situation occurred which would clearly indicate that the defense
                            of Quemoy and Matsu were related to the defense of Formosa. With respect
                            to suggestion 2 above, the Secretary felt, and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> strongly concurred, that such
                            an announcement that we were suspending the reduction of our forces
                            would do more than anything else to impress on free world opinion that
                            we are serious in our intention to defend Formosa. It should also aid in
                            convincing the Communists of the seriousness of our intention and might
                            result in more free-world pressure against the Chinese Communists. He
                            said that such a statement would bring our actions into conformity with
                            what we are saying. He also approved of suggestion 3, above, that we
                            should take steps to increase the ability to defend Formosa. However, he
                            asked Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> if such
                            steps involved action against the Chinese Communist build-up on the
                            mainland, particularly with respect to airfields. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied in the negative.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he
                            understood that diplomatic efforts to reduce the possibility of
                            hostilities through <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> action had failed,
                            and he inquired whether this understanding was correct. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that the
                            British were opposed to pressing forward with a resolution in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and that he was in touch with <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> on this matter. He felt it was
                            important to take some further step in the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>, but while the present prospect of <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> agreement was not bright, we were
                            continuing our efforts.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then said that he
                            thought the Chiefs, when they reconsidered the memorandum on
                                Monday,<note n="6" xml:id="d170fn6">March 28.</note> might drop
                            suggestion 1, above, and rely on the Congressional Joint Resolution as
                            the basis of our position. They might then go ahead to develop
                            suggestions 2 and 3 above.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then said he was
                            seriously disturbed by the build-up of the Chinese Communist airfields
                            which would enable them to attack Formosa and do great damage. This
                            airfield build-up was not related to action against the offshore
                            islands, but to action against Formosa. He believed that we must be in a
                            position to prevent <pb n="403" xml:id="pg_403" facs="0431"/>this
                            build-up. He felt that we should tell the Chinese Communists that if
                            they did not cease the build-up, we would consider the build-up as an
                            active preparation for war and would be forced to act accordingly.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he did not
                            feel that the improvement of airfields could be considered as an act of
                            war, and pointed out that we were constantly improving and strengthening
                            airfields in various parts of the world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> said to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> that as he understood him, Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> did not believe the situation
                            could be stabilized in the Far East without hostilities and without the
                            Chinese Communists getting a bloody nose. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> concurred that this was his
                            view. He went on to say that if, as he believed, hostilities would take
                            place in the Far East, the US might initially receive a set-back if the
                            Chinese Communists were permitted to go on with their build-up on the
                            mainland. Any such initial setback would lead immediately to a
                            Congressional inquiry of the Pearl Harbor type as to where the
                            responsibility lay for the set-back. Therefore, it was important that
                            the record be clear that the US, in the light of a pre-Pearl Harbor type
                            of situation where an attack might be expected, had taken every
                            precaution and every action to ensure the security of its forces prior
                            to an attack.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then said he
                            would like to refer to a point Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had brought up earlier in the conversation. This
                            was how, if Formosa was vital to US security, we could hold the island
                            regardless of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. He
                            noted that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> draft paper had
                            indicated that we should not commit further forces to Formosa other than
                            possibly an additional air wing. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> had stressed that the great danger was the
                            defection of certain of the Chinese Nationalists on Formosa, and had
                            suggested that the stationing of a division there might be a determining
                            factor in preventing such defection. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he did not believe a
                            division could prevent 24 Chinese divisions from defecting. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> replied that it was
                            not a question of 24 divisions defecting all at one whack, but the fact
                            that certain leaders might be tempted to defect. The presence of a US
                            Division might prevent this situation from arising. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then pointed out that a Marine
                            division could be deployed there but that it would raise all kinds of
                            questions, including: the permission of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName>; the construction of semi-permanent
                            quarters which would be expensive; the problems raised by the
                            introduction on Formosa of a good many thousand American soldiers who
                            were paid far in excess of the Chinese Nationalist troops and would take
                            away all the girls; and the fact that once the division was stationed
                            there, it would probably have to be kept there for an indeterminate and
                            long period of time. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> believed that despite these problems the Chiefs
                            should take a very hard and careful look at this question, since he <pb
                                n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0432"/>was inclined to agree with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> that it might
                            have considerable merit. Also, he would be prepared to recommend the
                            deployment of some additional air wings to the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>The meeting adjourned with the understanding that Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> would be in further touch with
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> next week on
                            this matter, after the Chiefs had reviewed their draft paper, which
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated would
                            undergo a number of draft changes as well as some of the changes which
                            would stem from the present meeting.</p>

                                    expected the Soviets to veto the Resolution but I must confess I
                                    did not expect that you would. In deference to your views we
                                    will hold up immediate action but you should know that the
                                    President and I doubt that circumstances will permit of
                                    indefinitely leaving the matter moribund in the Security
                                    Council. Moreover, if fighting should break out on the China
                                    coast I have grave doubts that with the Soviet in the chair we
                                    could in the month of April secure the rapid action which would
                                    then be required of the Council.</p>
                                <p>I am surprised that you feel our agreed Resolution<note n="2"
                                        xml:id="d171fn2">See <ref target="#d42fn5">footnote 5,

                                    designed solely to confirm <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                        >Chiang</persName>’s position in the offshore islands. The
                                    purpose of the Resolution to stop fighting was thoroughly gone
                                    into before we both and New Zealand agreed to it and you will
                                    recall that our minute of understanding of January 26<note n="3"
                                        xml:id="d171fn3">See <ref target="#d43">Document
                                        43</ref>.</note> said that, unless otherwise agreed, we
                                    would make every effort to prevent any amendment of substance to
                                    the Resolution as it had been painstakingly agreed.</p>
                                <p>If now you believe the language should be amended in order to lay
                                    the emphasis elsewhere then I would welcome your
                                    suggestions.</p>
                                <p>Our purpose in seeking this further step in the Security Council
                                    is to use that solemn forum to create and rally the forces of
                                    world opinion so that those forces will become a moral deterrent
                                    to the breach of the peace by anyone in the China area. This is
                                    not an academic matter. Nor is it a desire just to make a
                                    speech. The risk of <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0433"
                                    />hostilities is very real and if they do break out there can be
                                    no assurance that they will not become extended. That is what we
                                    want to prevent. We fear that at Bandung the <gloss
                                        target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s will get what they
                                    consider a green light for violence unless there are some
                                    counteracting opinions.</p>
                                <p>I can understand your desire to foresee every future step should
                                    the Resolution fail. In a situation as serious and uncertain as
                                    this I think that is impossible. It will have to be left to
                                    events and future agreement between us and our other friends.
                                    Moreover, as you have seen from my last message to you we are
                                    willing to defer a vote on the Resolution. The important thing
                                    is that it would be on the table so that later we could move
                                    more rapidly in the Council if need be and meanwhile we would

                        <p>Lately there has been a very definite feeling among the members of the
                            Cabinet, often openly expressed, that within a month we will actually be
                            fighting in the Formosa straits. It is, of course, entirely possible
                            that this is true, because the Red Chinese appear to be completely
                            reckless, arrogant, possibly over-confident, and completely indifferent
                            as to human losses.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, I believe hostilities are not so imminent as is indicated
                            by the forebodings of a number of my associates. It is clear that this
                            gloomy outlook has been communicated to others because a number of
                            articles in the papers state that the Administration is rather expecting
                            hostilities within a month.</p>
                        <p>I have so often been through these periods of strain that I have become
                            accustomed to the fact that most of the calamities that we anticipate
                            really never occur. No period was more illustrative of this truth than
                            the six months following upon the outbreak of our war in 1941. Every
                            prophet in those days was one of gloom. Only two or <pb n="406"

                            up in the mind or in the imagination came to pass.</p>

                                    not the United States will defend the Quemoy and Matsu Island
                                    groups is essentially a political decision because of the

                                    Militarily, the loss of any or all of the coastal islands would

                                        against any Chinese Nationalist controlled territory, the

                            he discussed with President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> that morning “the rash of stories which broke
                            out in the press and on radio and television over the weekend to the
                            effect that the Chinese Reds would invade Matsu Island by April 15th and
                            would invade Quemoy within a month after that”, stories which, <persName
                                corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> stated, had originated with
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName>. He told the
                            President that he was meeting that evening with a group of newsmen and
                            would undoubtedly be asked about the story. His diary entry continues as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“When I was talking to the President, he took off his glasses and
                                    characteristically chewed on the end of the earpiece. When I
                                    finished, he said, ‘I couldn’t agree with you more. Are you sure
                                    that this came from <persName corresp="#p_CARB1"
                                        >Carney</persName>?’ I told him that I was and that I had
                                    been so informed by several of my newsmen friends in Washington.
                                    He then exploded, got up from his desk and walked around the
                                    room. As he walked, he talked rapidly and forcefully and said:
                                    ‘By God, this has got to stop. These fellows like <persName

                                    Joint Chiefs of Staff. They are giving just their own service’s
                                    viewpoint and presenting it as the entire Administration
                                    viewpoint. I’m going to see <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                        >Radford</persName> in half an hour, and I’m going to tell

                                    stop talking. I’m also going to see <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                        >Charlie Wilson</persName> at 11:00 and I’m going to tell
                                    him the same thing.’ The President then said, ‘I think that you
                                    should tell the reporters you are meeting with tonight the
                                    following: Of course, there is always a danger in the Far East.

                                    are fanatical Communists and have publicly stated that they are
                                    going to try to take Formosa. But we are trying to keep the
                                    peace. We are not looking for war and I think the stories like
                                    the ones they get from <persName corresp="#p_CARB1"
                                        >Carney</persName>, when published, are a great disservice
                                    to the United States. They’re going to look awful silly when
                                    April 15th comes along and there is no incident, because
                                    honestly our information is that there is no build-up off those
                                    islands as yet to sustain any attack, and believe me, they’re
                                    not going to take those islands just by wishing for them. They
                                    are well-equipped and well-defended and they can only be taken,
                                    if at all, by a prolonged all-out attack. I would also tell them
                                    that you are not normally a betting man, but if any of them
                                    wanted to bet a thousand dollars that we would be in war on any
                                    of the dates they wrote about, you would be happy to bet them.’
                                    I interrupted laughingly to say, ‘If you’ll let me say a hundred
                                    dollars, I’ll do it.’ He said O.K.”</p>

                        <p>The Secretary began by outlining a proposed new Resolution for the
                            Security Council,<note n="2" xml:id="d175fn2"><p>Reference is apparently
                                    to a draft resolution dated March 27, which bears no indication
                                    of the drafter but was based on several previous drafts by
                                        <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> with extensive
                                    revisions in <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>”
                                    handwriting. The operative portion reads as follows:</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">Calls upon</hi> the People’s Republic of China
                                    promptly to make clear its intent not to attack Taiwan (Formosa)
                                    and the Penghus (Pescadores) with force, and to abstain from any
                                    such attack;</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">Calls upon</hi> the Republic of China
                                    reciprocally to abstain from using Taiwan (Formosa) and the
                                    Penghus (Pescadores) as a base for armed attack against the
                                    Mainland of China;</p>
                                <p>“<hi rend="italic">And declares</hi> that it remains seized of
                                    the question.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.)</p></note> and
                            indicated that it was designed to try and break our present stalemate
                            which resulted largely from Great Britain’s refusal at this time to
                            honor her earlier commitment concerning “Oracle”. He said that the
                            purpose of the Resolution was (a) to restrain the Chinese Communists
                            from an attack or (b) gain allied support for our position if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s did attack.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName>, emphasizing that the
                            important thing was to line up the free world behind the defense of
                            Formosa as opposed to the offshore islands, said that he felt the
                            operative paragraph in the Resolution calling for a statement of
                            “intent” by the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s was dangerous
                            (a) because they would not give such a declaration and (b) because
                            someone might then call for a declaration of “intent” by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s, which they also would never
                            give.</p>
                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> came in at this

                        <p>The Secretary commented that we do not, of course, know the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> war plans for China, if there should be
                            an attack on the islands or other hostilities in that area. He made the
                            point, however, that atomic or thermonuclear weapons would undoubtedly
                            figure in these plans, and he wondered whether <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> might not have a feeling that an
                            atomic attack on the mainland as a beginning would be a poor way to gain
                            the support of the Chinese people for his cause. He emphasized that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> might, of course, be
                            bothered by no such feelings, but he felt that this idea might
                            profitably be explored with the Gimo.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said that we should
                            consider the true and ultimate effect of this Resolution. Either of two
                            things might happen: <list>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> pointed up the need for
                            a broader decision as to the ultimate ends we wish to achieve before we
                            can profitably speak of tactics.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                >Phleger</persName>’s conclusion that, if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s rejected the Security Council
                            Resolution, as is likely, this would virtually commit us to the defense
                            of Quemoy and Matsu; and pointed out that our world position would then
                            be that we were defending these islands only because, and clearly
                            because the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s would not agree
                            to say that they are not going to attack Formosa. It would be clear to
                            the world that all the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s had to
                            do to stop (or not start) a war is to say that they are not going to
                            attack Formosa. Therefore, this entire course of action, the Secretary
                            agreed, would probably result in a military engagement in defense of
                            Quemoy and Matsu, but under optimum conditions of world opinion.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> felt that this was
                            forcing us into an unnecessarily rigid position, and reverted to his
                            theme that our most important objective should be to line up free world
                            support behind that part of our policy which it would support—namely,
                            the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. He felt that we should and
                            could line up such support by holding out the bait of a peacefully
                            controlled evacuation of the offshore islands which would be
                            accomplished at our recommendation and under our protection.<note n="3"

                                recommended this course in a memorandum of March 28 to <persName

                            Zealand, and quite probably even Britain, might be induced to come out
                            and give a specific guarantee concerning Formosa under these
                            circumstances. In this connection, he pointed out Morrison’s<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d175fn4"><persName>Herbert S. Morrison</persName>, Deputy

                            statements, indicating his support of the continued freedom of Formosa,
                            and said that this led him to believe that the Conservatives could take
                            such a position, even before an election, without serious fear of making
                            it an election issue.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then raised the question of the desirability of placing
                            certain United States ground forces on Formosa—possibly a Marine
                            Division. He commented that some felt this would be a powerful aid to
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> morale, as an indication
                            of our intention to stay and to defend that island; and that this would
                            also be an effective anti-subversion weapon, in that a local commander
                            might be willing to deliver over an army if he felt that no fight would
                            be involved, but he would be much more hesitant if he knew that this
                            would mean a full-scale battle. If we had troops there this would
                            unquestionably mean a full-scale battle with American troops.</p>
                        <p>He also pointed out that when this question had been raised last Saturday
                            in his meeting in Defense, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> had raised a <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412"
                                facs="0440"/>number of objections, largely on matériel and logistic
                            grounds: the already crowded conditions in Formosa, the high comparative
                            pay of American troops vis-à-vis Chinese, and resultant social and
                            morale problems.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bissell concurred that although the danger of subversion from the top
                            was probably ever-present in the Chinese Army, the prospect of a hard
                            fight would undoubtedly make a real difference in preventing the
                            delivery of an army to the enemy. It would not be any deterrent to the
                            defection of a General as an individual, but this is, of course, a far
                            less serious problem.</p>
                        <p>He raised the possibility of having <gloss target="#t_ANZUS1"
                                >Anzus</gloss> troops, and possibly Philippine troops on Formosa, as
                            well as our own.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then threw in for discussion the additional possibility of
                            a blockade of the China Coast.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> felt that <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">PL</gloss> 4 granted sufficient authority to
                            institute a blockade.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed, and indicated that such a blockade must include a
                            major portion of the China Coast, and specifically all the great ports
                            such as Shanghai and Canton.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bissell</persName> asked if such a blockade would be
                            directed primarily against the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>
                            buildup endangering Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> pointed out there is no
                            such thing as a limited blockade, except in geographical terms. Within
                            the blockaded area, all cargoes are stopped. However, he conceded that
                            the most direct and noticeable advantage from our point of view would
                            probably be in terms of crippling the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss> buildup endangering Formosa.</p>
                        <p>He pointed out that a blockade is an act of war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then reverted to the more general theme, and emphasized his
                            unwillingness to get forced into the position wherein the time, the
                            place and the manner of fighting all belong to the enemy. He pointed out
                            that such would be the case if we were to fight in direct defense of the
                            offshore islands, and specifically if we extended the fighting on to the
                            immediately adjacent Chinese mainland which has (presumably) been
                            fortified, built up and prepared by the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >ChiCom</gloss>s for just such an eventuality. The Secretary asked
                            how we could get away from this position in the present situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that
                            morale is a two-sided matter and that we here are dealing not only with
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> morale, but also with
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> morale, which has already
                            been fed an exhilarating diet of success, and might well become
                            completely euphoric if given any more success—specifically Quemoy and
                            Matsu. He also pointed out that Quemoy and Matsu are more defensible in
                            military terms than was Berlin; but that Berlin was saved by the
                            resolution of the free world.</p>
                        <pb n="413" xml:id="pg_413" facs="0441"/>
                        <p>The Secretary then threw out the idea of making our response to an attack
                            on Quemoy and Matsu a generalized rather than local response. He said
                            that we might destroy the great <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            dumps in China (which, incidentally, can be done with conventional
                            weapons), cut bridges, rail lines and communications generally …; and
                            generally engage in a severe punitive action across the length and
                            breadth of China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> again raised the
                            question of where this ultimately end us up, what kind of a permanent
                            solution it produces, and what kind of a permanent solution we are
                            seeking.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that it would be a deterrent to a <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss> attack on the islands if they
                            knew that our reaction would not be limited in area. He felt that it was
                            no particular deterrent to such an attack for them to be convinced that
                            we would fight, but in a limited area where they are well dug in and
                            prepared.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that another factor not to be ignored was that
                            we cannot splurge our limited supply of atomic weapons without serious
                            danger to the entire international balance of power; and therefore any
                            use which is made of them must be very carefully planned and thought
                            out. The Secretary complained that he felt that none of these things had
                            been adequately thought out in connection with this situation—he had the
                            feeling that we are drifting in very dangerous waters without an
                            adequately prepared chart—that we have not given sufficient thought to
                            the most effective deterrents to a possible war originating in this
                            area. He pointed out, in support of his feeling, that a limited defense
                            of the islands was no great deterrent, that such a limited defense might
                            have to be done two or three or even more times—and it obviously
                            provides no permanent solution. … All of these matters should receive
                            much more consideration and thought.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that he
                            saw no difference in principle, assuming the islands were attacked, if
                            our retaliation was in the vicinity of Amoy or in the vicinity of
                            Canton—both were on the mainland of China. He would feel that such
                            retaliation should be in the area calculated to produce the greatest
                            effect, rather than the area of closest proximity to the attack.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> pointed out that if such
                            a policy of generalized punishment were adopted as our reaction to an
                            attack on the islands, this would mean that the islands themselves would
                            probably be lost.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed, and emphasized that the islands must not be allowed
                            to become a psychological symbol, as in the case of Dien Bien Phu. He
                            outlined his theory of X and 2X—that any time the enemy wished to attain
                            X, we would exact a cost of 2X from them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> said that he had
                            grave worries as to the political and psychological effect of such a
                            “generalized retribution” policy <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0442"
                            />against the mainland of China. He said that if, in response to a local
                            attack, we send our bombers ranging China (and particularly if we use
                            atomic weapons) our purpose may be felt by our allies (and possibly by
                            our enemies) to be the destruction of the Chinese Communists’ regime,
                            rather than the repelling of an attack on the islands. Our allies are
                            confident that any genuine threat to the integrity of the Chinese
                            Communist regime would bring the Soviet Union to her aid, in a military
                            sense, which would mean the beginning of a world war. Any such policy of
                            ours would, therefore, cause our allies to back away, not only in the
                            Far East but probably in Europe, in Africa and all over the globe.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> commented that our
                            allies have been backing away from our Far Eastern policies in any case,
                            and will probably continue to do so anyway whenever we take a firm
                            line.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed to an extent, and cited the recent case of the
                            British in Laos, when they undermined our encouragement to the Laotian
                            Government by telling that Government that they felt no outside aid
                            would be forthcoming in the event of a Vietminh invasion of Laos,
                            assuming that such invasion was caused by the Laotians militarily
                            seeking to regain their two Northern provinces.</p>
                        <p>He reverted to the matter of the new Security Council draft, and raised
                            several questions: Do we want to take any <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> action? If so, is this a good draft? The Secretary
                            commented that he thought it was, and he felt it would improve our
                            position—but he agreed that it would only be effective and should only
                            be put forward if we were actually prepared to react to an attack on
                            Quemoy and Matsu, assuming one came. If we were prepared to react to
                            such an attack, however, the putting forward of this Security Council
                            Resolution, he felt, would better our legal and moral position before
                            the world, both in present circumstances and under such an
                            eventuality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Bissell</persName> commented that if we make a decision to
                            make our reaction to any attack on the islands general across China,
                            rather than specific in defense of those islands, we should take certain
                            specific actions: (1) we should reduce the island garrisons, so that
                            their loss will not be so severe. Such reduction of garrisons will also
                            serve notice that we consider these as outposts rather than as
                            defensible positions. (2) We should institute an obvious air buildup in
                            other parts of the general area, which will demonstrate our intention
                            and preparedness to make such a generalized reaction.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that, of course, it was essential that if we
                            intended to make such a generalized reaction, we should see that the
                            enemy was fully informed of our intention, as otherwise such a decision
                            would be no deterrent whatsoever.</p>

                        <p>(Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> came in at this
                            point)</p>
                        <p>The Secretary outlined certain portions of the foregoing for Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName>’ benefit.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that if we
                            are (if the President is) going to change our (his) mind about defending
                            these islands, we have an awful lot of work to do on <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> pointed out that we have given <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> a commitment that we would
                            defend the islands under present conditions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">MacArthur</persName> demurred and said
                            he felt we had given no such commitment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reiterated that we
                            had given such a commitment to his own certain knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that he did not want this discussion interpreted
                            to mean that the President had necessarily changed his mind. He pointed
                            out, however, that the President is intensely disturbed by the entire
                            situation, and wants every possible avenue of action leading to a
                            possible peaceful and successful conclusion explored thoroughly.</p>
                        <p>Until now, much of our thinking has been in terms of the presumption that
                            a “declaration of intent” on our part to defend the offshore islands was
                            sufficient to deter an attack, and therefore effectively to achieve
                            their defense. The Secretary feels that this may no longer be a valid
                            assumption, and we must therefore think in other terms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> once again brought up
                            the question of our basic objectives. He cited our mutual defense
                            treaties with Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia and other areas of the Far
                            East and of the world; and he pointed out that this situation is a
                            current test of what was actually to be done to defend a threatened
                            area, at least part of which was a treaty area. What type of permanent
                            over-all solution are we striving for in this area and within the
                            context of our treaty obligations in this area—and therefore, by
                            implication, in all other endangered areas within our treaty framework.
                            What are our basic objectives? Which of these possible courses of action
                            we have been discussing best furthers our achieving them?</p>

                        <p>Thank you very much for your further message about the offshore
                                islands.<note n="2" xml:id="d176fn2">Transmitted in <ref
                                    target="#d171">Document 171</ref>.</note> My colleagues and I
                            are grateful for your willingness to defer action in the Security
                            Council at the present moment. Please do not think we do not understand
                            the difficulties of your position. We recognise the danger that the
                            Chinese Communists may precipitate a conflict. That incidentally is one
                            reason why we are anxious to find some means of getting <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> out of the coastal
                            islands before an attack can develop. Meanwhile we are at one with you
                            in wanting to deter the Communists from attacking. But I do not consider
                            that action in the Security Council will deter them. Our Chargé
                            d’Affaires at Peking thinks that it is more likely to cause them to
                            attack than to restrain them.</p>
                        <p>As regards the wording of the draft resolution, a number of things have
                            happened since our minute of January 26 was agreed. The Chinese have
                            shown us clearly that they are not prepared to agree to any cease-fire
                            and the Soviet Union have equally made clear that they do not think any
                            solution can be found through the Security Council. Moreover, in my
                            statement of March 8<note n="3" xml:id="d176fn3">See <ref
                                    target="#d144fn3">footnote 3, Document 144</ref>.</note> I
                            stated Her Majesty’s Government’s position on this whole question. It
                            would be very difficult indeed to debate this issue without any
                            reference to our formally expressed views. <persName corresp="#p_PLB1"
                                >Pearson</persName>’s recent speech<note n="4" xml:id="d176fn4">In a
                                statement on March 24 in the Canadian House of Commons, Foreign
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_PLB1">Pearson</persName> had stated
                                the Canadian view that a distinction could be made, politically and
                                strategically, between Formosa and the coastal islands and had urged
                                a peaceful solution to the crisis. The text of the statement is in
                                    <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> Library,

                            Quemoy and Matsu. We share the Canadian’s views. Thus any debate in the
                            Security Council far from rallying world opinion might only serve to
                            reveal our differences. No amendment of the wording of the resolution
                            could avert this danger.</p>
                        <p>You are worried about Bandung. I agree. The Chinese will certainly do all
                            they can to get the conference to give them its approval and we must try
                            to stop this. But I believe that if we initiate a debate in the Security
                            Council the Asians will simply regard us as expressing Western views and
                            as trying to forestall them at Bandung. I am sure that the effect on
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> for example would be <pb n="417"
                                xml:id="pg_417" facs="0445"/>bad. I think we would do far better to
                            work on the Asian leaders themselves to warn them against giving the
                            Chinese the green light and to urge them to press for the renunciation
                            of force. This is likely to appeal particularly to the Asians. Pressure
                            from the Asians is likely to be more effective in deterring the Chinese
                            than anything we can say in the Security Council, which they have
                            discounted already. I have therefore instructed Her Majesty’s
                            Representatives in the countries in which I think we may have some
                            influence to urge this on the Governments to which they are accredited.
                            It would be very helpful if your Ambassadors could do the same.</p>
                        <p>In all this I do not want you to think that we are trying to exercise a
                            veto on you. We are not. We are concerned only about the best means of
                            achieving our common objective. I understand your desire to bring in the
                            Security Council at the shortest possible notice if there should be a
                            flare-up. It occurs to me that the New Zealanders might help in this now
                            by instructing their delegate to send a letter to the President of the
                            Council on the following lines:—He had hoped for a meeting of the
                            Security Council at which all interested parties would have been
                            represented; since this could not take place he thought that his
                            colleagues would be interested to see the resolution which he would have
                            put forward had the meeting happened; he was therefore circulating it
                            but he was not asking for it to be discussed at present, particularly
                            since fortunately no fighting was now taking place. If something like
                            this were put forward I have it in mind that it might enable you to
                            claim the necessary priority for the resolution to be discussed first at
                            a later meeting if the need arose. If you think there is anything in
                            this perhaps our experts in New York could examine the idea more
                            closely. I assume of course that we would not press the issue to a
                            debate without further consultation as envisaged in paragraph 5(D) of
                            the Working Party’s report. Will you let me know what you think of this?
                            It might go part way to meet your objective though I still think the
                            less action we take in the Security Council before Bandung the
                                better.<note n="5" xml:id="d176fn5"><p>Telegram 5023 to London,

                                <p>“Thanks for your message of March 28. We are considering the
                                    suggestion that the present Resolution should be submitted by
                                    New Zealand in a letter to the President of the Council. I
                                    appreciate that in making this suggestion you have gone a
                                    considerable way to meet our point of view and for this I thank
                                    you. On the other hand I see difficulties in explaining why this
                                    curious and novel course is being followed. <persName

                                <p>“I went over with the President the draft of his letter to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_CSWS1">Churchill</persName> about Far

                                <p>“We discussed a memorandum of <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">George
                                        Humphrey</persName> about Formosa and I pointed out that it
                                    would be quite unrealistic to demand formal acceptance by the
                                    Chinese Communists of the persistence of the Nationalist régime
                                    on Formosa and that while this gambit might be good from the
                                    standpoint of domestic opinion, it would almost surely be
                                    treated as an insincere effort on the part of foreign countries.
                                    I pointed out that I had several times said that we would not
                                    require the Chinese Communists to renounce their claims to
                                    Formosa, but merely to renounce the effort to take Formosa by
                                    force.” (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, <persName

                                >Winston</persName></hi>: I have no doubt that you and your Cabinet
                            find it necessary, just as we do, to ponder daily on the world situation
                            and to calculate as carefully as you can every move to be made as you
                            strive to straighten out some specific portion of the tangled mess that
                            we call international relations.</p>
                        <p>Of one thing I have always been completely confident—that you are as
                            fully dedicated as I am to promoting between our two governments and our
                            two peoples clear unity of purpose and common understanding of the
                            obstacles we face so as to double our strength as we push forward in the
                            search for an honorable peace.</p>
                        <p>It is because of this confidence in our common intent—indeed, I hope I
                            may say our indestructible personal friendship—that I venture to bring
                            up an apparent difference between our two governments that puzzles us
                            sorely and constantly. Although we seem always to see eye to eye with
                            you when we contemplate any European problem, our respective attitudes
                            toward similar problems in the Orient are frequently so dissimilar as to
                            be almost mutually antagonistic. I know that you could make the same
                            observation regarding us; possibly this fact troubles you and your
                            associates just as much as it does us.<note n="2" xml:id="d177fn2"><p>In
                                    a letter dated March 22, to Prime Minister <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CSWS1">Churchill</persName>, the President made
                                    the following comments relating to the Far East:</p>
                                <p>“As you know, I am dedicated to the idea that unless the free
                                    world can stand firmly together in important problems, our
                                    strength will be wasted and we shall in the long run be
                                    ineffective in our struggle to advance freedom in the world and
                                    to stop the spread of Communism. I believe it to be especially
                                    important that we seek to understand each other’s viewpoints in
                                    Southeast Asia, because in that region we have a very
                                    delicate—sometimes dangerously weak—situation and one to which
                                    the future welfare and fortunes of the free world are definitely
                                    related. If we can achieve the kind of common understanding and
                                    thinking that we should, then I feel that there will never be
                                    any doubts as to this country’s readiness to stand firmly by the
                                    side of any other free nation opposing aggression in that
                                    region. We have no possessions in that immediate area.
                                    Consequently, we cannot be accused of any support of colonialism
                                    or of imperialistic designs. We recognize situations that have
                                    been properly and legally established and we certainly want to
                                    halt Communism dead in its tracks.</p>
                                <p>“To do this, one of the essentials is a strong and continuous
                                    land defense of Formosa. This can be done—certainly under
                                    present conditions—only by <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                        Kai-shek</persName> and his troops. This in turn means that
                                    their morale and their vigor, their training and equipment, must
                                    all be adequately assured. Until the time comes that they
                                    themselves feel that their morale can be sustained, even though
                                    their forces are withdrawn from all of their outlying positions,
                                    we must be exceedingly careful of the pressures we attempt to
                                    apply to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> to bring
                                    about such a result.</p>
                                <p>“Except for this one feature, I agree entirely with the thoughts
                                    you have expressed in your former letters on this touchy
                                    subject, and I hope also that you have no difficulty of seeing
                                    the importance of this morale feature in Formosa.” (<hi
                                        rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, Whitman File, DDE

                        <pb n="419" xml:id="pg_419" facs="0447"/>
                        <p>I beg of you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to think of this letter as a
                            complaint, or as any effort to prove that we are right and you are
                            wrong. In writing to you in this vein I am interested in one thing and
                            one thing only—how can we and our two governments come closer together
                            in our thinking so as to achieve a better result in matters that are
                            serious and fateful for both our nations? I know that frankness on my
                            part will not be interpreted as accusation or recrimination.</p>
                        <p>I assume that the existence of the differences I mention is so clearly,
                            even sadly, recognized on both sides of the water as to require no
                            elaboration. The words Formosa, Quemoy and Matsu typify them today, as
                            Manchuria did in 1931.</p>
                        <p>The conclusion seems inescapable that these differences come about
                            because we do not agree on the probable extent and the importance of
                            further Communist expansion in Asia. In our contacts with New Zealand
                            and Australia, we have the feeling that we encounter a concern no less
                            acute than ours; but your own government seems to regard Communist
                            aggression in Asia as of little significance to the free world
                            future.</p>
                        <p>As I once explained to you, we are not interested in Quemoy and Matsu as
                            such. But because of the conviction that the loss of Formosa would doom
                            the Philippines and eventually the remainder of the region, we are
                            determined that it shall not fall into the hands of the Communists,
                            either through all-out attack or, as would appear to be far more likely,
                            through harrassing air attacks, threats and subversion.</p>
                        <p>The only way in which pressure of the latter type can be successfully
                            resisted is to sustain a high morale among <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s forces. The danger of internal subversion and
                            consequent collapse in Formosa is always present; <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> feels this keenly and we believe
                            it necessary to help him combat it.</p>
                        <pb n="420" xml:id="pg_420" facs="0448"/>
                        <p>In fact, we feel this is vitally important to the interests of the entire
                            Western world.</p>
                        <p>Of course I would personally be very happy, both as a political leader
                            and as an ex-soldier who may have a bit of competence in the strategic
                            field, to see <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>, <hi
                                rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> and in accordance with what he
                            believed to be his own best interests, withdraw from Quemoy and the
                            Matsus.</p>
                        <p>But I am just as unwilling to put so much pressure on him that he might
                            give up the entire struggle in utter discouragement. It’s at this point
                            that you and ourselves seem to part company. But we cannot understand
                            how the free world can hold Formosa except as <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> provides the necessary ground
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Another apparent difference between us that added to our bewilderment
                            occurred in connection with <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Foster</persName>’s recent visit to the Far East. He urged the
                            Government of Laos, while it still has the ability to do so, to clean
                            out the areas in that country where Communist elements are establishing
                            themselves in some strength. The Laos Government is fully justified in
                            taking such action under the terms of the Geneva agreements. When
                            Laotian officials expressed to <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Foster</persName> some concern lest such action on their part
                            provoke attack from the Viet Minh and the Chinese Communists, he assured
                            them that aggression from without would bring into play the Manila Pact.
                            This would mean assistance from the other signatories of the Pact to
                            preserve the territorial integrity of Laos.</p>
                        <p>Some time after this conversation, we heard that both the British and the
                            French Ambassadors in Laos informed that Government that under no
                            circumstances could Laos expect any help against outside aggression,
                            under the terms of the Manila Pact, if such aggression should result
                            from their own efforts to rule their internal affairs.</p>
                        <p>As a result, we have a situation in which the Communists, in the affected
                            areas of Laos, grow stronger and stronger, and we face a possibility of
                            ultimately losing that entire territory to the Communists, just as we
                            lost North Vietnam.</p>
                        <p>Another point bothers us. This country believes that the existence of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> Government confers upon
                            all of us one advantage that is not often publicly noted. Throughout the
                            Far East there are great numbers of “émigré” Chinese. These people, in
                            most cases, possess sort of a dual citizenship—one pertaining to the
                            country in which they reside; the other to China. Up to date, millions
                            of these people have preserved their allegiance to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> and have not become Communist
                            cells menacing the countries where they are now residents. This affects
                            the Philippines, Indonesia and, of course, other areas such as Malaya
                            and Hongkong.</p>
                        <p>This is another fact that points to the very great desirability of
                            sustaining <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s prestige and
                            the morale of his followers. If the <pb n="421" xml:id="pg_421"
                                facs="0449"/>Chinese National Government should disappear, these
                            émigré Chinese will certainly deem themselves subjects of the Chinese
                            Communist Government and they will quickly add to the difficulties of
                            their adopted countries. Indeed, where their numbers are quite strong, I
                            believe that their influence might become decisive and that no outside
                            aid that any of us could bring to bear could prevent these regions from
                            going completely Communist. Do not such possibilities concern you?</p>
                        <p>As we consider such developments and possibilities, it seems to me we
                            cannot fail to conclude that the time to stop any advance of Communism
                            in Asia is here, now.</p>
                        <p>We have come to the point where every additional backward step must be
                            deemed a defeat for the Western world. In fact, it is a triple defeat.
                            First, we lose a potential ally. Next, we give to an implacable enemy
                            another recruit. Beyond this, every such retreat creates in the minds of
                            neutrals the fear that we do not mean what we say when we pledge our
                            support to people who want to remain free. We show ourselves fearful of
                            the Communistic brigands and create the impression that we are slinking
                            along in the shadows, hoping that the beast will finally be satiated and
                            cease his predatory tactics before he finally devours us. So the third
                            result is that the morale of our friends crumbles.</p>
                        <p>Of course it is easy to say that this is a gross overstatement of the
                            case. Because the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s have no
                            great fleet and cannot now attack across the seas, it is natural to
                            underestimate their potential strength and the fearful eventual results
                            of the crumbling process. So I believe it critically important that we
                            make a sober estimate of what we are up against.</p>
                        <p>Two decades ago we had the fatuous hope that Hitler, Mussolini and the
                            Japanese war lords would decide, before we might become personally
                            involved, that they had enough and would let the world live in peace. We
                            saw the result.</p>
                        <p>Yet the Communist sweep over the world since World War II has been much
                            faster and much more relentless than the 1930[’s] sweep of the
                            dictators. I do believe that all of us must begin to look some of these
                            unpleasant facts squarely in the face and meet them exactly as our Grand
                            Alliance of the 40’s met our enemies and vanquished them.</p>
                        <p>You and I have been through many things where our judgments have not
                            always been as one, but, on my part at least, my admiration and
                            affection for you were never lessened. In this long experience, my hope
                            is rooted that the two of us may bring up some thought or idea that
                            could help us achieve a personal concord that could, in turn, help our
                            two governments act more effectively against Communists everywhere.</p>

                                    Quemoy and Matsu had always been Chinese territory, and U.S.
                                    defense of Nationalist forces on those islands would be “taking

                            the Formosa Straits. Incidentally, your former letter was read by
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Foster Dulles</persName>, and I believe
                            that he wrote to you at some length. I am taking the liberty of sharing
                            your second letter with him also.</p>
                        <p>Your presentation is, of course, most persuasive, but you do not tell me
                                <hi rend="italic">what to do if we lose Formosa</hi>. I feel that,
                            after all, here is the crux of the matter, and I must say that you seem
                            to brush off this very grave possibility far more lightly than I
                            possibly can.</p>
                        <p>Another point: While you say that the Asian public opinion would be
                            shocked beyond measure at the thought of the United States participating
                            in a so-called “civil war,” yet in point of actual fact the never-ending
                            problem we are up against is to convince these Asian nations that there
                            is validity to our protestations of friendly support even when we urge
                            their gradual abandonment of area after area to the greed of the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>I have come to the conclusion that some of our traditional ideas of
                            international sportsmanship are scarcely applicable in the morass in
                            which the world now flounders.</p>
                        <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0451"/>
                        <p>The central fact of today’s life is that we are in a life and death
                            struggle of ideologies. It is freedom against dictatorship; Communism
                            against capitalism; concepts of human dignity against the materialistic
                            dialectic. The Communists, and I mean Marx, Lenin, Stalin and now their
                            successors and offshoots—such as Mau [<persName corresp="#p_MT1"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Mao</hi></persName>] and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>—have all announced their adherence
                            to the theory of world revolution and overthrow of all other forms of
                            government by force and violence. They have complete contempt for any of
                            those concepts of honor, decency and integrity which must underlie any
                            successful practice of international law and order as we have always
                            understood it.</p>
                        <p>I say again that I do not believe any other person occupying an important
                            political position in this world gives more thought and more hard study
                            than I do to ways and means of preserving and strengthening of peace. No
                            one is more jealous of America’s good name, both as of today and in the
                            pages of history. Yet it is quite clear that if the Communists achieve
                            their world aims, there will be no American history as we know it.
                            Whatever account may appear in a Communist history concerning this great
                            land will serve only the doctrinal aims and ambitions of Communist
                            masters.</p>
                        <p>Now I am sure you will not think for a minute that I am trying to be
                            hysterical and emotional in the effort to avoid cold-blooded analysis
                            and conclusions. The clear fact is that though we must fight this battle
                            without losing our self respect or violating our concepts of duty and of
                            right, or of breaking faith with our friends, we cannot forever permit
                            the Communists to achieve success and expand their territories merely
                            because we refuse to employ effective methods to defeat ruthless peoples
                            who are for aggression and for capturing the minds and bodies of
                            additional millions.</p>
                        <p>Truth, honor, justice, consideration for others, liberty for all—the
                            problem is how to preserve them, nurture them and keep the peace—if this
                            last is possible—when we are opposed by people who scorn to give any
                            validity whatsoever to those values. I believe we can do it, but <hi
                                rend="italic">we must not confuse these values with mere procedures,
                                even though these last may have at one time held almost the status
                                of moral concepts</hi>.</p>
                        <p>I believe that Mr. <persName>Truman</persName> was right to oppose the
                            invasion in South Korea, even though at that moment the Communists
                            attempted to make it look like a “civil war.” A good many other nations
                            thought he was right, and some fifteen of them sent at least token
                            forces to help us on the battleground.</p>
                        <p>By no means am I saying that we must—that we should—fight for Quemoy and
                            the Matsus. What I am asking you is this: If you became convinced that
                            the capture of these two places by international Communism would
                            inevitably result in the later loss of Formosa to the free world, what
                            would you do” Beyond question the <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424"
                                facs="0452"/>opinion in Southeast Asia is that the loss of Formosa
                            would be catastrophic; the Philippines and Indonesia would rapidly be
                            lost to us. Incidentally, the offshore islands do have a defensive value
                            to Formosa. I spoke only about their lack of value in any program of
                            attack against China proper. Defensively they practically block almost
                            any Communist attempt to use the two available harbors immediately west
                            of Formosa for the initiating of amphibious operations.</p>
                        <p>As you can see, I have not attempted to develop any really logical chain
                            of thought in this letter; I have no great argument with the
                            presentation that you submit. I merely say that I think there are
                            important facets of this whole tangled question that you have not stared
                            squarely in the eye and that when you do so, you will find that some of
                            the deportment that was once an essential part of international
                            relationships cannot be faithfully and stubbornly maintained by
                            ourselves when the other side insists on practicing the habits of a

                            all problems pertaining to our foreign relations. He emphasized his
                            desire to conduct our foreign relations on a truly bipartisan basis and
                            stated that he and his people are always willing and eager to have the

                            and a possible four-power conference.]</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Formosa</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> then discussed fully and frankly the situation
                            with respect to Formosa. He indicated that he had returned from his
                            recent trip with great concern as to the Formosan situation—that the
                            Chinese Communists were arrogant and more or less drunk with power
                            because of their recent successes in that part of the world. He
                            mentioned, in this connection, the following: <list>

                                <item>Evacuation of Tachen Islands by the Nationalist Chinese for
                                    which the Communist Chinese take the credit.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>He indicated that in their mind (Chinese Communists) these and other
                            successes had been obtained with practically no interference on the part
                            of the Allies and are almost an indication that the free world was not
                            only taking reverses but “almost asking for more.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> quoted a diplomat as saying that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had made the
                            following statement: “There will be a war with the United States and we
                            may lose as many as one hundred million men (Chinese) but there will
                            still be four hundred and fifty million left.” Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that this sort of
                            statement may be for propaganda purposes, but on the other hand might
                            well indicate the thinking of the people who are now heading the Chinese
                            Communist movement. He was frank in saying that we did not know just
                            what the Soviets are thinking and doing with possible respect to the
                            encouragement of the Chinese Communists in their intentions to capture
                            of Formosa. He made it clear that all the Communist propaganda had been
                            directed to the capture of Formosa and the elimination of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, <pb n="426"
                                xml:id="pg_426" facs="0454"/>but that none of it had been
                            specifically directed to the capture of Quemoy and the Matsus as such.
                            He stated that the men in the Kremlin might well be considering the idea
                            that a move to capture Formosa by the Chinese Communists would serve the
                            purpose of engaging the United States in that area, causing us to use
                            atomic weapons with the resulting great propaganda value to the
                            Communists that would come out of such an approach. He pointed out that
                            the artillery replacements [<hi rend="italic">emplacements</hi>], etc.,
                            now being constructed by the Chinese Communists could be knocked out
                            only with atomic weapons and that the use of these weapons could well
                            result in a “fall out” which in turn might kill many thousands of
                            Chinese. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> further
                            pointed out that we must consider the effect on our atomic stockpile of
                            any appreciable use of atomic weapons in such a manner. On the other
                            hand, he indicated that the Soviets must recognize the fact that a war
                            on Formosa would require them to greatly step-up their delivery of
                            military equipment and supplies to the Chinese Communists and that they
                            may not be ready to do this.</p>
                        <p>In bringing out the factors that must be considered in an effort to
                            determine the Soviet intentions, he referred to a visit last winter of
                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> and <persName

                                <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> made a ringing
                            speech in denunciation of the United States for interference in the
                            Formosan situation and the necessity of Formosa being made a part of the
                            Chinese Communist State.<note n="3" xml:id="d179fn3">Reference is to a
                                speech made by <persName corresp="#p_KNS1">Khrushchev</persName> in

                        <p>In discussing the possible timing of an attack on Formosa, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> spoke of the coming Asio-African
                            conference and indicated that the Chinese Communists might well like to
                            attend such a conference as “a great peace loving nation” and
                            consequently not take any action until after the conference was
                            completed. He further indicated that one good factor in assessing what
                            might take place was the propaganda line being put out by Peiping—that
                            before any new move on their part, the Chinese Communists usually went
                            to some length to condition their people and the world through very
                            strong propaganda. He stated that, whereas the propaganda aimed toward
                            an attack on Formosa had until very recently been 25% of the total
                            propaganda being put out, it now had dropped to roughly 5%.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Formosa Resolution</hi>—Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> pointed out that the resolution which the
                            Administration had requested of the Congress and which the Congress had
                            practically unanimously approved was deliberately made to indicate that
                            we were going to assist in the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores
                            Islands. He emphasized that these areas and only these areas were
                            included in the resolution and that the United <pb n="427"
                                xml:id="pg_427" facs="0455"/>States has no specific obligations as
                            such to assist in the defense of Quemoy and the Matsus. He stated that
                            this was done so that the Flag and the prestige of the United States
                            would not <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> be involved in any
                            operations pertaining to these islands. He further indicated that this
                            line of action was taken so as not to make known to our enemy just what
                            our plans and moves would be in case they took offensive action. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> pointed out that the
                            speedy and practically unanimous approval by the Congress of the Formosa
                            resolution was in his opinion one of the greatest factors in deterring
                            military action on the part of the Chinese Communists and in building up
                            free world morale in that area.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Quemoy and the Matsu Islands</hi>—Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated that our allies really
                            had comparatively little knowledge of the intricacies of the situation
                            which we face with respect to Quemoy and the Matsus. They look on them
                            as comparatively contiguous islands which by nature belong to the
                            mainland. They fail to consider the tremendous morale effect that the
                            loss of these islands might well have on all the peoples in that part of
                            the world—that we also have to consider most seriously the morale
                            effects of the loss of these islands on the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s on Formosa—that there are adequate troops available
                            to defend Formosa unless there are some internal defections in <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s Army. We must remember that
                            all of his people came from the mainland and left their families there
                            in many instances and hope sometime to return to the mainland. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> indicated these as
                            some of the factors involved in the decision we would have to make with
                            regard to Quemoy and the Matsus in case they were attacked. In reply to
                            a question, he indicated that the only way in his opinion there could be
                            a withdrawal before hostilities from Quemoy and the Matsus without
                            incurring most serious morale reaction would be for <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> to decide on his own
                            that such a withdrawal is in the best interest of the
                            Chi-Nats—otherwise, the morale reaction on the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s and other people in that part of
                            the world would be very bad.</p>

                        <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ presentation,
                            the President opened the meeting to questions—indicating that he and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> would attempt to
                            answer as fully and frankly as possible any questions anyone might have.
                            Practically all of the ensuing questions were directed to the Formosan
                            situation with particular emphasis on our possible participation in the
                            defense of Quemoy and the Matsus.</p>
                        <p>Speaker Rayburn stated his understanding of Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ remarks to indicate that in the
                            event of an attack on Quemoy and the Matsus, the United States would
                            find itself participating. The President elected to answer this
                            question. He stated that actually we have not made that decision and
                            will not make it until we are in possession <pb n="428" xml:id="pg_428"
                                facs="0456"/>of the particular circumstances surrounding such an
                            attack. He stated that it is a problem that he and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> live with 24-hours a day and
                            actually is the most difficult problem with which he has been faced
                            since he took office. The President further discussed the possibilities,
                            depending upon the type of attack. He stated that if an attack developed
                            of such proportions that there was a reasonable chance of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chi-Nat</gloss>s winning it by themselves with
                            the equipment which we have and will make available to them, he
                            personally would hold off and give them the opportunity. He feels that
                            such a victory by the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chi-Nat</gloss>s would
                            have a tremendous morale effect not only on Formosa but throughout that
                            part of the world. On the other hand, he indicated that it would be
                            necessary for the Chinese Communists to either capture or neutralize the
                            islands before carrying out an attack on Formosa, as these islands
                            blocked the two most important harbors from which an attack could be
                            launched.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RJP1">Richards</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> how much consideration was being
                            given to the morale effect on Formosa and that part of the world in case
                            we let Quemoy and the Matsus fall into Communist hands. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> emphasized that this is one of
                            the most important factors involved in the entire situation and again
                            reiterated that it is a factor that is not understood by our Allies. He
                            spoke of his efforts to clarify this on his recent visit to Canada.</p>
                        <p>Speaker Rayburn indicated that our Allies are not giving us any support
                            in that part of the world. The President brought out that in his opinion
                            the British and the French and our other Allies would support us
                            wholeheartedly in the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores and that
                            there are no indications that they would be just lukewarm about it, but
                            that the question bothering them was the possibility of beginning a war
                            over Quemoy and the Matsus.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName> stated that he was not sure in his own
                            mind just what should be done, but he recognized that the Congress had
                            put the matter in the hands of the President and that whether or not he
                            (Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName>) agreed with the President’s
                            decision when made, he certainly would support it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Gordon</persName> and Mr. Vorys asked questions similar to
                            the foregoing on the Formosan situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>McCormack</persName> told the President that he would like
                            to ask a question but that he would understand the President’s reasons
                            if the President did not feel he was in a position to answer such a
                            question. The question was: “Have developments in the international
                            situation caused any change in the Administration’s proposal to reduce
                            the size of the Army?” The President stated that he would be glad to
                            answer such a question. He stated frankly that there had been no change
                            in his plans to reduce the size of the Army. He felt that such a
                            reduction was justified. He indicated that in the kind of warfare in <pb
                                n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0457"/>which we would find ourselves
                            engaged, he foresaw no chance to transport divisions to overseas bases
                            in the early stages of such a war. He indicated his strong hope for a
                            ready Reserve but went on to state that such Reserve, as well as the
                            National Guard troops, would undoubtedly find itself initially in the
                            position of restoring order around our major cities after an attack. He
                            further stated that if there were a desire to spend an additional $2 or
                            $3 billion on defense he (the President) felt that this money could be
                            used to much greater advantage in extending and improving our early
                            warning service (even with the knowledge that the equipment would become
                            obsolete at an early date), and the procurement of more aircraft. He
                            went on to say that he has given great consideration to the particular
                            matter of the size of our Armed Forces and that his decision comes in
                            part from his experience acquired as an infantry soldier.</p>
                        <p>The general discussion was free and frank. All the questions indicated a
                            genuine concern and there were no efforts made to put anyone on the
                            spot. Everyone was permitted to ask any questions that he might have,
                            and the meeting was not broken up until Speaker Rayburn indicated to the
                            President that it was necessary for the Members of Congress to get back
                            to the House Floor.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Possible Remarks to the Press Re Meeting</hi>—Regarding
                            what might be said to the Press as the meeting was breaking up, Speaker
                            Rayburn stated that he didn’t propose to say anything to the Press and
                            didn’t think that anyone should say anything unless the President
                            himself wished to do so. The President indicated that he would not make
                            a statement but he saw no reason why any member of the group should not
                            tell the Press that the group had discussed all matters of interest with
                            respect to the foreign situation.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary observed that we also were “not enamored” with the
                            proposals. The situation, as he saw it, was that there were now three
                            main courses open to us: (1) We could go ahead and table a resolution
                            under circumstances which, however, might compel the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> publicly to dissent; (2) we could accept
                            the <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> proposal which, in the
                            Secretary’s opinion, was evidence that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> had moved forward to a certain extent, or (3) we
                            could do nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked for the Secretary’s view about the possibility of
                            moving ahead in April when the <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> is
                            in the Chair. The Secretary replied that he would not consider this an
                            insurmountable obstacle: On previous occasions it had been possible to
                            obtain action in the Security Council when the Soviet was in the Chair
                            and Sobolev appeared to be more reasonable than some of his
                            predecessors.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador then asked whether the Secretary felt as strongly as he
                            had previously about proceeding in the Security Council.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he would be inclined to go along with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>’s view that it would be
                            inadvisable to stir up a row in the Security Council before the Bandung
                            Conference. It would, of course, have been preferable had a resolution
                            been tabled since this would have enabled our Asian friends to point at
                            something definite when the subject of Formosa is raised at Bandung. It
                            would have enabled them pointedly to ask why the Chinese Communists were
                            opposed to a cease-fire. However, in the present circumstances, the
                            Secretary felt it would perhaps be better to sit it out a bit
                            longer.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that consequently we are trying to bring our
                            viewpoint to the attention of free Asian governments since there appears
                            to be little doubt that the Chinese Communists will speak about U.S.
                            aggression on Formosa in the Bandung Conference. Our Asian friends would
                            be given a good briefing. They would be reminded for example that under
                            the terms of the Japanese Peace Treaty no benefits inured to
                            non-signatories and that consequently so far as third powers are
                            concerned, the title to certain islands still remains with Japan. This
                            had purposely been placed in the treaty because of the Kuriles but of
                            course it applied equally to Formosa so far as Chinese Communist
                            pretensions to title might be concerned.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that if a big-scale attack looked imminent then we
                            would want to move in the Security Council.…</p>

                        <p>The Secretary expressed doubt whether it would be possible short of
                            coercion to persuade the Chinese Nationalists to relinquish the
                            off-shore islands. Certainly this would not be possible unless there
                            were some adequate makeweight and even then there would remain doubts
                            about the morale and reaction of the Chinese forces on Formosa.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that for the moment he thought it would be best to
                            defer any action at least until we had heard from Australia about the

                            described the status of the Chinese Nationalist forces and the change in

                            situation had become serious last September. He went on to describe both

                                >Dulles</persName> expressed considerable concern about the
                            political repercussions of <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0461"/>the
                            proposed use of atomic weapons against Chinese Communist military
                            targets which would be used against the offshore islands and Formosa.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that
                            precision atomic weapons would be used, and that except in one or two
                            instances no large cities or concentrations of civilian population were
                            involved in the targets.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> then inquired
                            about ways and means of “taking out” Chinese Communist artillery
                            emplacements in areas adjacent to the Nationalist-held offshore islands.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> thought that
                            these might be taken out by resort to conventional weapons, but that
                            such a decision would have to be taken by the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> suggested the
                            desirability of a coordinated intelligence estimate as to the probable
                            number of civilian casualties which might be estimated if the plans
                            outlined by Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> were
                            to be implemented.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he could not help but feel that we are
                            underestimating the sanity of the Chinese Communists. It seemed to him
                            that our very great military capabilities against them should surely
                            give them pause before they undertook a resort to military measures to
                            seize the offshore islands in defiance of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Governor <persName corresp="#p_SHE1">Stassen</persName> said that he was
                            quite sure that if the Chinese Communists clearly understood the
                            intentions of the United States they would not move.</p>

                                that 30 key officials, drawn from all the U.S. agencies represented
                                in Taipei and selected on the basis of experience and interest, had
                                been consulted in the survey.</note> reveals that these officials do
                            not think that morale in Taiwan has changed significantly over the past
                            year. Native Taiwanese tend to feel that the Mutual Security Treaty has
                            increased the security of their home island and are not overly concerned
                            with developments tending to decrease the likelihood of a counter-attack
                            on the mainland. Mainland emigres have been heartened by the Treaty and
                            disturbed by developments which appear to defer even further their
                            chances of returning home. Most of this group, however, has long
                            realized that a return to the mainland will be long and hard so were not
                            greatly shocked by recent developments tending to confirm that view.
                            Subversion is well under control in Taiwan, according to the officials
                            surveyed. The state of Chinese-American cooperation continues to be
                            satisfactory despite some recriminations over our attempts to get a
                            cease-fire in the Taiwan Strait and our failure to commit ourselves on
                            the defense of Matsu and Quemoy. The Taiwan public has however, become
                            increasingly confused about the direction of US policy toward China as
                            the result of press reports from Washington in the past few days. What
                            effect this confusion will have, our Embassy says, is not discernible at
                            the moment.</p>

                        <p>“During and after Geneva conference US Government three times gave
                            promise for 27 Chinese students in US to return to their country.
                            However, up to now only ten students have actually returned their
                            country. This is not satisfactory. There are over 5,000 Chinese students
                            in US. According incomplete statistics 316 such students have asked
                            permission leave US for their country. Not only have they not been
                            allowed leave US but they have been subjected to oppressive measures and
                            continue to be ill-treated. The fact American Government continues
                            prevent these students return their country and to ill-treat them is
                            absolutely unjustifiable. These students have right return their
                            homeland and not to grant them this right is violation their rights and
                            causes great anxiety to their families especially as these students have
                            been in US for long time. To prevent members these families to become
                            reunited is violation human rights. I solemnly declare to US Government
                            my government and people my country insist in declaring their objection
                            to such American action against these students and that such action is
                            unjustifiable illegal and inhuman. This action on part American
                            Government has caused great indignation among people China. US
                            Government must forthwith grant freedom these Chinese students to return
                            their homeland. I hope you will inform your government this situation
                            and let me know at earliest date that arrangements for granting
                            permission our students in US to return their homeland have been made.
                            Referring our meeting Geneva February 28 and your query concerning
                            welfare certain Americans in our country my answer is as far as I know

                            government may wish to make to what you have just stated I wish to tell
                            you that what you have just said about alleged unjustifiable illegal and
                            inhuman treatment of your students in the US is not based on any facts
                            and is not at all true. Actually it is groundless. Can you furnish any
                            concrete facts in support of what you have said about alleged
                            ill-treatment and oppression of your students in the US? I have noted
                            what you have said about the welfare Americans mentioned in our previous
                            meeting February 28 and would ask you to continue furnish us information
                            concerning their welfare.”</p>
                        <p>Chinese replied “If we consider certain facts we can state that what we
                            have said about oppression against our students in the US is true
                            because last year during similar meeting in Geneva between our side and
                            your representatives Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> declared US Government had refused 120 exit
                            permit applications for Chinese students to return to their
                                homeland.<note n="4" xml:id="d183fn4"><persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                    >Johnson</persName> stated this at a meeting with Ambassador
                                    <persName corresp="#p_WP1">Wang Ping-nan</persName> on June 15,
                                1954, but at subsequent U.S.-Chinese meetings in Geneva in 1954,
                                U.S. representatives stated that U.S. objections to the departure of
                                a number of the 120 students had been withdrawn and that the
                                students had been so informed. For documentation, see <ref
                                    target="frus1952-54v14p1#pg_338"><hi rend="italic">Foreign

                                        >xiv</hi>, Part 1, pp. 338</ref> ff.</note> He then also
                            said that he would propose to American Government to reconsider these
                            120 refusals. Up to now nothing has come of this. Such a situation is
                            not good.” At this point <persName corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName>
                            interrupted to say that this cannot be construed to be considered
                            oppression or ill treatment. The Chinese made note of this and did not
                            make any specific reply. The Chinese then went to say “on August 5, 1954
                            twenty-six Chinese students in the US after their exit permit
                            application had been refused wrote to Mr. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> appealing to him to let them
                            return to their homeland. However their appeal has not been granted. On
                            September 2, 1954 nine students also wrote to Mr. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> to be allowed to go home but
                            to no avail. We consider these refusals unjustifiable. Thirty-one
                            Chinese students in the US also wrote to Secretary General <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> asking him to support their sacred right
                            to repatriation to enable them to join their families but again in this
                            case the US Government has done nothing. In view these refusals I wish
                            to repeat my request that US Government must grant these students
                            permission to return their homeland. Their desire join their parents
                            wives and children cannot be violated. Why does US Government still hold
                            these innocent students and prevent them to return to China? As you know
                            these Chinese students were sent to the US only to study there and many
                            are now prevented from going home. This we discussed fully during our
                            meeting at time Geneva conference here. There have also been cases in
                            which Chinese students in US have been arrested or detained even when
                            they were just leaving <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>en route
                            their country. In some cases they were notified by US Government that if
                            they attempted to leave US they will be fined over $5,000 or imprisoned
                            for 5 years and their passports have actually been taken from them. I
                            again repeat Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1">Johnson</persName>
                            had told us he would ask US Government reconsider 120 exit permit
                            refusals for Chinese students but this reconsideration has not taken
                            place and we do not know if the letter addressed to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> has ever been answered. We
                            ask you to communicate what I have said to your government promptly and
                            to let us know at earliest date when we can expect a reply through you
                            from your government.” In reply <persName corresp="#p_GFC1"
                                >Gowen</persName> said “I shall communicate what you have stated to
                            my government and let you know any reply I may receive for you. You said
                            10 students have already left the US. Actually, basing myself on
                            information which I had as of February 28, last number Chinese students
                            who up to that time had left US was 14. Again as of that time 10 other
                            students had not yet completed their travel plans and 3 had voluntarily
                            decided remain in US. Situation your remaining students who had applied
                            for exit permit was still being examined as of time our previous
                            meeting. I am not aware any ill-treatment oppression or unjustifiable
                            measures against your students in US. Many are pursuing chosen studies
                            or other occupations and no cases are known of unfair or unusual
                            treatment. All are well treated. Are you interested in receiving
                            information about welfare any particular Chinese students in US?”</p>
                        <p>Chinese replied “should our government be interested in welfare any
                            particular Chinese students in US we shall let you know. Do you have any
                            other matter or question to submit at this meeting?” <persName
                                corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName> said “during our last meeting you
                            stated Americans in your country may freely communicate with relatives
                            in US. I then asked you to request your Red Cross do everything possible
                            to expedite transmission letters from these Americans to their families.
                            Have you received any information this subject?” Chinese answered “we
                            have every reason believe such letters can be freely exchanged through
                            Red Cross channels.” <persName corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName> asked
                            whether small packages containing medicines and food stuffs sent to
                            Americans in Red China might be receipted by addressees and if such
                            receipts bearing their signature could be mailed back to families or Red
                            Cross in US. Chinese said “we shall ascertain from our Red Cross if this
                            procedure can be followed and let you know”. <persName corresp="#p_GFC1"
                                >Gowen</persName> said “I stress strong opposition my government and
                            my people to unwarranted detention Americans in your country and repeat
                            demand made under orders from my government for liberation these
                            Americans as I stated here on February 28”. Chinese said “we confirm
                            policy our government is to grant Americans permission to leave China
                            after examination provided no cases criminal or civil nature pending

                        <p>The operations would make optimum use of Chinese Nationalist RF 86
                            capability (three planes). <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>
                            would undertake the operation south of the 30th parallel (but including
                            Shanghai) as necessary in order to determine the buildup of the threat
                            in that area. <gloss target="#t_CINCFE1">CINCFE</gloss>, if requested by
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> would perform similar
                            operations north of the 30th parallel. Operations from Formosa were to
                            be authorized. The results were to be transmitted to <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> in flash reports. <pb n="439"
                                xml:id="pg_439" facs="0467"/>Every precaution was to be taken to
                            avoid detection. The <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was to be
                            informed of any unusual incident, or detection, or interception during
                            flights.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Smedberg amplified this instruction by saying that only one plane
                            would go over at a time, that the pass over enemy territory would
                            probably take not more than 20 minutes, that consequently there was
                            little point in including in the signal (as has been done in previous
                            cases) a requirement that if unusual incident, detection or interception
                            occurred, the flight be curtailed in mid-passage and the aircraft
                            returned to base. He said that it was not clear whether, if unusual
                            incident, detection, and/or interception occurred during one flight, and
                            a report of such circumstances were made following return of the
                            aircraft to base, a subsequent overflight would be made without prior
                            clearance from <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Smedberg added that he had just cleared the signal with <gloss

                                >Murphy</persName> who also gave his concurrence.</p>
                        <p>I then telephoned Admiral Smedberg and informed him that the Department
                            had no objection to the signal as presented to me.</p>

                        <p>The specific reason for the meeting was to discuss Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s proposal to send
                            approximately 10,000 U.S. troops to Formosa for manning anti-aircraft
                            and aircraft warning equipment which has recently been delivered, and to
                            train Chinese Nationalist personnel in its use. The President suggested
                            consideration of a more limited number of U.S. troops, with the thought
                            that the Chinese Nationalists would have to fill in more quickly, and
                            the training cycle would thereby be expedited.</p>
                        <p>The entire Formosa and offshore island situation was then explored in
                            some detail. After an extended discussion, and without coming to any
                            decision, the President summarized the U.S. position in the following
                            terms: <list>

                                <item>The paramount consideration was to preserve the morale and the

                                    result in the collapse or subversion of their forces, with a
                                    correspondingly drastic impact throughout East and Southeast

                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>“To sum up: I have still the same view of Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s frame of mind as I
                                    had immediately on my return from Peking and which I expressed
                                    publicly as well as privately to you. This is that my exposition
                                    of the prisoners’ case during our talks at Peking did succeed in
                                    correcting Peking’s misunderstandings as regards facts, and
                                    miscalculations as regards the political reactions to their
                                    handling of the case; that this had given rise to the prospect
                                    that he would find it to his own advantage to release the
                                    prisoners provided he could do so without loss of face; and that
                                    the question of prestige would weigh even more heavily with his
                                    Party than with him.”</p>
                                <p>The Secretary-General recommended that “as long as Mr. <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> maintains the
                                    channel that was established as the result of our Peking
                                    conversations we should continue to use it for exercising the
                                    maximum inner pressure, attainable by ‘quiet’ diplomacy, till we
                                    are convinced that all the possibilities of achieving our goal
                                    have been exhausted.” He added that if after the Bandung
                                    Conference no progress had been made, it would be useful to
                                    review the situation. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, <gloss

                        <p>Please tell the Secretary General that I was very glad to receive his
                            thoughtful appraisal of the situation, which I have read carefully. I
                            want him to know that we appreciate all that he has done. Of course we
                            share his hope that his efforts will result in the early release of the
                            fliers, though so far there seems little reason for optimism. I agree
                            that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> should
                            continue for the time being along the lines indicated in his letter,
                            that is, to pursue what he calls “inner pressures” and “quiet
                            diplomacy”. However, if neither the families’ appeals nor the need for
                            the Chinese Communists to appear in the best light at Bandung results in
                            the fliers’ release, I strongly concur in <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>’s view that we must then consider where we
                            stand and whether there are other approaches that may bring about the
                            fliers’ release.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I share your feeling that events so far are not particularly
                            encouraging, but at the same time I think that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> makes a convincing case
                            that warrants our going along with him at least until the end of
                            April.</p>

                                concerning the technically-trained Chinese students who had been
                                denied permission to leave the United States. It stated that the
                                question of their detention had been re-examined when direct talks
                                were initiated with the Chinese Communists at Geneva in June 1954,
                                that their cases had been reviewed and 27 had been granted exit
                                permits as of October 1954, but that since the sentencing of the
                                U.S. airmen, there had been no further action. It concluded that the
                                Department of State was studying the problem and would have

                            Americans imprisoned in Communist China. It has been concluded, in the

                            to the release of the imprisoned Americans. On the other hand, release
                            of the students would enable the U.S. to press its case against the
                            Chinese Communists more effectively in the United Nations and elsewhere.

                                of Taiwan. In the event that they should not be held, the United
                                States “would expect to replace their military role by naval craft
                                and to offset the loss in any other practicable ways”. It recommends
                                that they should be regarded as “outposts to be held so long as
                                there is advantage in doing so” but “subject to relinquishment if

                        <p>Inspired by the enlightened self-interest of the United States, this
                            country has committed itself, by treaty with the Chinese Nationalist
                            Government, to the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. The treaty
                            area does not include other islands held by units of the Chinese
                            Nationalist forces. But it is only fair to say that during the course of
                            the past several years, particularly since June 1950, the inter-mixture
                            of warfare, negotiations, public statements and military understandings
                            have given the Chinese Nationalists some right to assume that the United
                            States would probably participate in an active defense of the Quemoy and
                            the Matsu groups of islands.</p>
                        <p>To do so would commit United States military prestige to a campaign under
                            conditions favorable to the attacker. Because the world generally
                            regards the coastal islands as part of the mainland, our active
                            participation would forfeit the good opinion of much of the Western
                            world, with consequent damage to our interests in Europe and elsewhere.
                            There is much opposition in our own country to becoming involved
                            militarily in defense of the offshore islands, and in <pb n="446"
                                xml:id="pg_446" facs="0474"/>the event of such involvement our
                            people would be seriously divided at the very time when increased risk
                            of global war would underline the need for unity. Finally, even a
                            successful defensive campaign would not stabilize the situation; a new
                            attack could be expected at any time. But with American prestige
                            committed to the success of the defense, a disproportionate amount of
                            our disposable, mobile, reserves would be tied down indefinitely to this
                            one spot.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand refusal to participate in the defense of the offshore
                            areas might have equally disadvantageous results. First, most observers
                            assert that it would dismay the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s, <hi rend="italic">whose morale and military
                                efficiency are essential to the defense of Formosa—and the security

                            the Chinese Communists could result, it is alleged, in the
                            disintegration of all Asian opposition to the spread of Communism in
                            that continent.</p>
                        <p>So, today, the Formosan situation presents a hard choice to American
                            political and military leaders; the only logical course of action is to
                            attempt to bring about reasonable changes in the situation rather than
                            to remain inert awaiting the inevitable moment of decision between two
                            unacceptable choices.</p>
                        <p>The Formosa problem cannot be considered in a vacuum; it is not isolated
                            from the rest of the world. The Chinese Communists have repeatedly
                            announced their determination to capture the island. Opinion in the free
                            world appears to back the American determination to assist the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s in the defense of the main
                            position, that is, Formosa and the Pescadores. But, as stated before,
                            world opinion most emphatically repudiates outside interference in any
                            Communist attack on Quemoy and the Matsus.</p>
                        <p>As you know, for many weeks I have been devoting time and attention to
                            this problem in the hope of finding some solution. Most of what follows
                            we have often discussed.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Existing Situation</hi></p>
                        <p>Since last September, when the Formosan question first came before the
                            National Security Council for intensive study, we have agreed that the
                            defense of the offshore islands presented to the United States very
                            unpalatable problems, both political and military. I have already
                            alluded to some of these.</p>
                        <p>Geographically the islands are difficult to defend, and their location
                            minimizes rather than maximizes the usefulness of our overwhelming
                                <gloss target="#t_SEA1">sea</gloss> strength, which strength would
                            be particularly effective in defending Formosa against the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>The offshore islands are subject to constant harassing and concentrated
                            destructive artillery fire from the mainland, and are so situated that
                            an amphibious attack against them could be carried forward <pb n="447"
                                xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>to the landing stages during the hours
                            of darkness of a single day. In view of the overwhelming land forces
                            available to the Red Chinese and the strength of the bombardment that
                            could be brought to bear on the islands, any successful defense would
                            necessarily require counteraction against the mainland of China
                            itself.</p>
                        <p>We have ample forewarning of the adverse character of world reaction that
                            would follow any such action on our part, especially if we felt
                            compelled to use atomic weapons—which we probably would in order to
                            insure success. The Chinese Nationalists would share our loss of free
                            world support through such an operation, while public opinion in the
                            United States would, to say the least, become further divided. If
                            conflict in that region should spread to global proportions, we would be
                            entering a life and death struggle under very great handicaps.</p>
                        <p>Even though a defensive effort might be temporarily successful, it would
                            in no way remove the existence of the permanent threat; both governments
                            would be led to immobilize more and more military strength for the
                            single purpose of defending the offshore islands, because our prestige
                            would have become involved, even though involuntarily. We would be
                            isolated in world opinion, and this could affect very disadvantageously
                            our treaties with Japan and in the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1"
                                >SEATO</gloss> region.</p>
                        <p>As long as <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> has powerful
                            forces deployed on these offshore islands, he is committed to full-out
                            defense. He is gambling his whole position in Formosa and his future as
                            a useful agent in helping to drive Communism from China against a local
                            and possibly temporary success in a precarious defense of two island
                            groups which are militarily weak.</p>
                        <p>All of these risks and disadvantages exist because of the calculation
                            that for us to persuade <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> to
                            adopt any other plan <hi rend="italic">would result in a collapse of
                                morale on Formosa and the loss to the free world of that bastion of
                                strength</hi>. In other words, the principal military reason for
                            holding these two groups of islands is the estimated effect of their
                            loss upon morale in Formosa.</p>
                        <p>An added consideration is, of course, the <hi rend="italic"
                                >psychological</hi> effect of such abandonment on other Asiatic
                            nations. It is generally accepted among our associates that retreat from
                            the Matsus and Quemoy—if occasioned by any influence of ours—might
                            create consternation among our friends in Asia, particularly in
                            Thailand, the Philippines, Laos and Cambodia. This, I suspect, is true,
                            and such a result could, of course, counter-balance any gains we might
                            make in winning to our side public opinion elsewhere in the world.</p>
                        <p>This circumstance, however, in no wise refutes the clear conviction that
                            militarily and politically we and the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s would be much better off if our national prestige

                            Pescadores. Moreover, if <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            should develop a satisfactory alternative so that it would, under his

                        <p>The worldwide political advantages of such an arrangement would be
                            incalculable. These advantages, I think, are so clearly implied in the
                            earlier parts of this memorandum that I shall not attempt to enumerate
                            them. But for ourselves one of the greatest advantages would be a
                            practically solidified public opinion in the United States.</p>
                        <p>To bring about the desired situation in the Formosan area, the United
                            States would be prepared to help materially. Such help could take any or
                            all of the following forms: <list>

                                    particularly of the kinds useful in the protection of that
                                    island against external attack and to maintain internal morale.
                                    For example, the aircraft squadron we presently have there could
                                    be increased to a wing. This would allow <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s own air forces to
                                    devote their exclusive attention to the support of the forward
                                    positions. We could station some additional anti-air craft
                                    artillery for the protection of fields, allowing <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s units of this kind to
                                    be devoted to the protection of cities. We could also station
                                    there a couple of regiments of Marines. All of this would be
                                    supported by certain logistic formations. Such a layout should
                                    have a very fine internal effect, particularly in giving visible
                                    evidence to all that the United States is irrevocably committed
                                    to the defense of Formosa.</item>

                                <item>The presence of these troops would likewise be of great

                                    force. Likewise, with this contingent of American forces on the
                                    island of Formosa, our own naval units would tend to take a more
                                    active part in defensive arrangements, allowing <persName

                        <p>While it is true under this system one or more of the forward positions
                            might eventually be lost, such loss would occur only after the defending
                            forces had exacted a fearful toll from the attackers, and <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s prestige and standing in
                            Southeast Asia would be increased rather than decreased as a result of a
                            gallant, prolonged and bitter defense conducted under these
                            circumstances. His own losses would be inconsequential both in personnel
                            and in material—the losses of the Communists should be very great
                            indeed.</p>
                        <p>Finally, an essential ingredient of success will be the skill of the
                            American negotiator picked to present the whole matter to <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. The crux of the negotiations
                            must be that “<persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> must sell
                            himself on the validity and value of the suggested program.” This means
                            that the negotiator must be a man whom <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> trusts and who is himself convinced of the
                            soundness of this program.</p>
                        <p>As you and I have fully agreed, there is no time for unnecessary
                            delay.</p>

                        <p>At a news conference on April 5, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied as follows to a question as to whether
                            the overall world position of the United States would necessarily be
                            weakened or might in fact be strengthened if the United States were to
                            base its commitments in the Formosa area exclusively upon Formosa and
                            the Pescadores: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“I have said many times, and I am glad to have a chance to say
                                    again, something which I can repeat by heart: The only
                                    commitment of the United States in that area is based
                                    exclusively on Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                                <p>“We have a treaty which confines the treaty area to Formosa and
                                    the Pescadores. We have a law which says that the armed forces
                                    of the United States can be used in that part of the area for
                                    the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores. We have no commitment
                                    of any kind, sort, or description, expressed or implied, which
                                    binds the United States to anything except the defense of
                                    Formosa and the Pescadores.</p>
                                <p>“Now you get to the question—if there seems to be an attack
                                    against Formosa and the Pescadores, how do you defend against
                                    that attack? That is the only question. Some people say that we
                                    should announce in advance precisely how we are going to defend
                                    and carry out our commitment on Formosa and the Pescadores and
                                    to say we will carry out that commitment by doing this or by not
                                    doing that. Once you extend your commitment to defend Formosa to
                                    a commitment as to particular means which you may use for
                                    defense, then <pb n="451" xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"/>you are
                                    getting into very difficult ground. We have a commitment,
                                    certainly, to defend the United States of America. But nobody
                                    yet has required us to state publicly precisely what the means
                                    would be of defense in the event of certain types of attack
                                    which cannot be predicted. I repeat—again and again and
                                    again—that our only commitment is to defend Formosa and the
                                    Pescadores and if there were no challenge to Formosa and the
                                    Pescadores, then there wouldn’t be any question as far as we are
                                    concerned of fighting in that area.” (Department of State <hi

                        </list>
                        <p>At lunch today the Indonesian Ambassador told me, on the basis of strict
                            confidence, that he had recently had a long conversation with Ambassador
                                <persName>Zaroubin</persName> on various matters including the
                            question of whether or not the Chinese Communists would actually attack
                            Quemoy and Matsu. Ambassador <persName>Moekarto</persName> said that
                            during this conversation he began teasing <persName>Zaroubin</persName>,
                            as he put it, about the Soviet Union letting the Chinese attack these
                            two little islands and threatening to bring on a general thermo-nuclear
                            warfare as a result. At first <persName>Zaroubin</persName> ducked the
                            whole issue but then he finally became rather annoyed and suddenly
                            blurted out that this was not true because the Chinese Communists were
                            not going to attack Quemoy and Matsu. Realizing what he had said,
                                <persName>Zaroubin</persName> abruptly changed the subject of
                            conversation. <persName>Moekarto</persName> was sure
                                <persName>Zaroubin</persName> had let this remark slip
                            unintentionally in a moment of provocation.</p>
                        <p>In any event <persName>Moekarto</persName> thought this slip was
                            particularly revealing. It conformed to the reports of the Indonesian
                            Ambassador in Peking who has been telling his government in Djakarta
                            that in his opinion the Chinese Communists would not attack the two
                            islands or Formosa.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, <persName>Moekarto</persName> said that this question
                            of whether they would or would not attack was very confusing. <persName

                                the United States.</note> who told <persName>Moekarto</persName>
                            that the Chinese <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0480"/>Communists had
                            the intention of attacking the two islands. When I asked
                                <persName>Moekarto</persName> whether or not he could tell from the
                            reports of the Indonesian Ambassador in Peking that the Chinese
                            Communists do or do not fully understand the readiness of the United
                            States to help in the defense of Taiwan, <persName>Moekarto</persName>
                            said that the position of the United States with respect to the two
                            islands is so ambiguous in Washington that neither he nor any of his
                            colleagues with whom he has discussed the matter can evaluate the
                            intentions of the United States and so report accurately to their
                            governments. <persName>Moekarto</persName> told me quite frankly that he
                            has been sounding out this question with several Asian and European
                            diplomats in Washington all of whom appear completely confused, he said,
                            regarding the United States position on the two islands. He acknowledged
                            that our position on Taiwan is clear but he felt that was not a crucial
                            issue. The question of whether the Chinese Communists will attack the
                            offshore islands and whether the United States will intervene against
                            that attack is the basic problem. He thought it would be better for the
                            United States to announce clearly that it would resist or that it would
                            not. He is afraid that in this “confusion” that the Chinese Communists
                            may become reckless and decide to launch an assault on the offshore
                            islands.</p>

                        <p>[Here follows discussion concerning changes in the British Government; on
                            April 6 <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> succeeded <persName
                                corresp="#p_CSWS1">Churchill</persName> as Prime Minister.]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said he had asked <persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir
                                Roger</persName> to come in to talk to him primarily about the
                            Bandung Conference. The Secretary felt that the Bandung Conference could
                            exercise a real influence for peace with respect to the Formosa
                            situation if something constructive came out of it. On the other hand,
                            the Secretary had received a recent indication, from Burma he believed,
                            that at Bandung it was probable that a resolution might be adopted which
                            neither the US nor the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would like. If
                            any resolution or statement came out of Bandung which seemed to give a
                            green light to the Chinese Communists to take Formosa, the possibility
                            of hostilities which could not be confined to the offshore islands and
                            Formosa was greatly enhanced. If, on the other hand, some resolution or
                            statement could come out of Bandung calling for a cease-fire and calling
                            on both parties not to resort to force, the chances of maintaining peace
                            in that area would be very considerably enhanced. In other words, the
                            question of war or peace in the Far East could be significantly affected
                            by what happens at Bandung.</p>
                        <p>In strictest confidence, the Secretary said he could tell <persName
                                corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> that if assurances could be
                            obtained through the Bandung Conference that the Chinese Communists
                            would agree to a cease-fire regarding Formosa which would leave the
                            islands to be fought for, this would in itself be a considerable
                            contribution, although it would obviously <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454"
                                facs="0482"/>be nowhere near as good as an over-all cease-fire such
                            as envisaged in the draft New Zealand Resolution prepared for
                            presentation to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The Secretary
                            said he had decided to urge certain friendly countries which would be
                            represented at Bandung to propose a cease-fire if the subject of peace
                            or the subject of Formosa came up at the Conference.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> asked if the Secretary
                            would suggest a general ceasefire or indicate that even a cease-fire for
                            Formosa leaving aside the question of the offshore islands would be
                            helpful. The Secretary replied that he did not contemplate suggesting
                            that the friendly countries propose a cease-fire for Formosa and the
                            Pescadores only, but rather a general cease-fire.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said he had been considerably depressed last evening
                            in thinking over the general situation in Asia. He felt that there were
                            signs that Asian solidarity in an anti-Western sense might be hardening.
                            He did not like <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s
                                speech<note n="2" xml:id="d193fn2">Reference is to a speech made by
                                Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> before

                            the Manila Pact as an organization which increased tension and might
                            lead to hostilities; he had attacked <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                                >NATO</gloss>, claiming it gave Portugal Western support in Asia
                            with respect to Goa; he had attacked the Union of South Africa; he had
                            attacked the West for “meddling” in the Middle East. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>’s speech had in spirit, though
                            not in content, reminded him of a speech made by a Czech, Hromadka,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d193fn3">Theologian Joseph L. Hromádka.</note> during
                            the 1948 World Council of Churches at Amsterdam. Hromadka had taken the
                            general line that Western civilization had failed and that some new type
                            of civilization was necessary to replace it. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName>’s speech had the same general ring. With respect
                            to Asia, the Secretary felt we were up against a bigger and more
                            long-term problem than the details or incidents which make daily
                            headlines in the press. In effect, he felt that there were Asian
                            elements that were pushing for a pan-Asian movement which would be by
                            its very nature and concept anti-Western. He hoped that the British
                            might, prior to Bandung, also use their very considerable influence with
                            certain friendly Asian countries so that both the Formosa situation and
                            the over-all problem of pan-Asianism might not become more
                            aggravated.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MSRM1">Sir Roger</persName> said he would report
                            this conversation to his Government, and he personally felt that they
                            would wish also to take a similar line.<note n="4" xml:id="d193fn4">On

                                South Asian Affairs, that the Foreign Office had previously taken
                                steps to urge upon some of the governments which would be

                            yet, but had in mind Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey,
                            possibly Iraq, and Lebanon in the event that

                            and the countries to which they were sent, it would be most helpful. The
                            Secretary replied that he would hope to be able to pass this word on to
                            him tomorrow, giving a list of the countries and the tenor of our
                                instructions.<note n="7" xml:id="d193fn7">See <ref target="#d197"

                        <p>The Secretary reiterated his grave concern regarding the Formosa
                            situation and his belief that the action of the Chinese Communists will
                            be influenced to a very considerable extent on what backing or approval
                            they believe they will get from other Asian powers. He then mentioned
                            and described in some detail the Chinese Communist activity in building
                            up and improving their air fields along the coast and in the interior
                            area opposite and just to the north and south of Formosa.</p>

                                fundamental position. It is based not only on loyalty to a faithful
                                ally and a sense of responsibility to the people of Taiwan, but also
                                on the desire to see the restoration of freedom to the Chinese
                                people on the mainland. We believe that opportunities to restore
                                freedom will arise, and that they can be most effectively used if

                                Taiwan, when the Communist revolution had not yet fully consolidated
                                its hold on the mainland, hopes could realistically be held of an
                                early overthrow of the Communist régime by armed invasion of the
                                mainland by the Chinese Nationalists on their initiative. This
                                possibility seems now to have disappeared. The Communists have had
                                more than five years to consolidate their position and entrench
                                their police system. Now, the Republic of China may have to await an
                                opportunity of a different character and one that cannot be wholly

                                National Army are essential to the defense of Taiwan. From the
                                combination of recent military operations, negotiations, public
                                statements and military understandings the Chinese Nationalists may
                                well have the impression, and certainly have a strong hope, that the
                                United States would participate in an active defense of the islands.
                                The risk exists, therefore, that for us to refuse to participate in
                                the defense of the offshore islands and to seek to persuade
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> to adopt any other
                                plan than all-out defense, would result in a collapse of morale on
                                Taiwan and the loss to the free world of that bastion of
                                strength.</item>

                                Their location minimizes rather than maximizes the usefulness of our
                                overwhelming <gloss target="#t_SEA1">sea</gloss> strength, which
                                would be particularly effective in defending Taiwan. The offshore
                                islands are subject to constant harassing and concentrated
                                destructive artillery fire from the mainland, and are so situated
                                that an amphibious attack against them could be carried forward to
                                the landing stages during the hours of darkness of a single day. In
                                view of the overwhelming land forces available to the Red Chinese
                                and the strength of the bombardment that could be brought to bear on
                                the islands, any successful defense would necessarily require
                                counteraction against the mainland of China itself. For the U.S. to
                                undertake their defense would commit our military prestige to a

                            <item>It is the view of U.S. military advisers, based on recent
                                intensive study, that a defense of the coastal islands cannot be
                                assured without the use of atomic weapons. It seems likely that
                                certain of the major offensive capabilities of the Chinese
                                Communists as against the coastal positions could not be nullified
                                without so considerable a use of atomic weapons that there would be
                                risk of large civilian casualties through after-effects, and indeed
                                the inhabitants of Quemoy and even Taiwan might not be immune under
                                certain atmospheric and wind conditions. Aside from the effects on
                                U.S. interests, it would seem doubtful that the long-range interest
                                of the Republic of China would be served by a defense of the coastal
                                positions involving a use of atomic weapons with consequences which
                                might destroy any hope of good will and future favorable reception

                                governments would be led to immobilize more and more military
                                strength for the single purpose of defending the offshore islands. A
                                disproportionate amount of our disposable, mobile reserves would be
                                held down indefinitely to this one spot, because our prestige would

                            <item>The islands are not important for a return by the Chinese

                                Section I above should make this feasible. The mainland area
                                immediately opposite Taiwan is largely separated by mountains from
                                the portions of China which are economically and politically
                                significant, and there are few means of communication. If it were

                            <item>The Taiwan problem cannot be considered in a vacuum; it is not
                                isolated from the rest of the world. Western opinion appears to back
                                the American determination to assist the Chinese Nationalists in the
                                defense of the main position, that is, Taiwan. But world opinion
                                preponderantly questions outside intervention to resist any
                                Communist attack on Quemoy and the Matsus. Because the world
                                generally regards the coastal islands as part of the mainland, our
                                active participation would forfeit the good opinion of much of the
                                Western world, with consequent damage to our interests in Europe and
                                elsewhere; it could affect very disadvantageously our treaties with
                                Japan and in the Southeast Asia region. We have ample forewarning of
                                the adverse character of world reaction that would follow any such
                                action on our part, especially if we felt compelled to use atomic
                                weapons. Moreover, there is much opposition in our own country to
                                becoming involved militarily in defense of the offshore islands, and
                                in the event of such involvement our people would be seriously
                                divided at the very time when increased risk of global war would
                                underline the need for unity. If conflict in that region should
                                spread to global proportions, we would be entering a life and death
                                struggle under very great handicaps.</item>

                                on Taiwan, particularly of the kinds useful in the protection of
                                that island against external attack and to maintain internal morale.
                                For example, the U.S. could: (a) increase the aircraft squadron
                                presently there to a wing, thus allowing <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                    >Chiang</persName>’s own air force to devote its exclusive
                                attention to the support of the forward positions; (b) station some
                                additional anti-aircraft artillery for the protection of fields,
                                allowing <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s units to be
                                devoted to the protection of cities; (c) station there a couple of
                                regiments of Marines; (d) support all these forces with certain
                                logistic formations. The presence of these forces would have a very
                                salutary effect in giving visible evidence to all that the United
                                States is irrevocably committed to the defense of Taiwan, would be

                                only after the defending forces had exacted a fearful toll from the

                                <persName>Romulo</persName> after reading it said he thought it was
                            fine and indicated that he would make use of it at the Bandung
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that the Chinese Communists have publicly and
                            at great length announced their intention of attacking Taiwan. He stated
                            that if the Communists were to refrain from such announcements and were
                            to announce they had no intention of attacking Taiwan, at the same time
                            agreeing to a cessation of all hostilities, our position with respect to
                            Quemoy and Matsu would be subject to change.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary stated that the Chinese Communists have an exceptionally
                            poor claim to Taiwan which has not been controlled by Mainland China for
                            60 years. He pointed out that the Japanese Peace Treaty provided only
                            that the Japanese relinquish Taiwan. He said that at Cairo it was agreed
                            that Taiwan would go to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>’s government which was then and is the “Republic
                            of China”.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary gave General <persName>Romulo</persName> a statement
                            reviewing the development of U.S. policy toward Taiwan with 43

                            English text Department’s April 2 press release<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d198fn2">The press release stated that the cases of those
                                Chinese students who had been previously refused permission to leave
                                the United States were under reexamination, that on March 31 the
                                Immigration and Naturalization Service rescinded restraining orders
                                in the cases of 76 students, who were consequently free to depart,
                                and that it was anticipated that action would soon be completed on
                                the few remaining cases. For text, see Department of State <hi

                            Chinese students. I orally translated release into French. Text was then
                            translated into Chinese. After lengthy discussion among Chinese
                            themselves during which <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Shen</persName> made
                            copious notes, I in strongest terms categorically rejected Chinese
                            Communists’ groundless allegations about illegal, inhuman and oppressive
                            treatment Chinese students in US. I most emphatically stated and
                            stressed all facts stated for my guidance in Department telegram
                                828.<note n="3" xml:id="d198fn3">Telegram 828 to Geneva, April 4,
                                instructed <persName corresp="#p_GFC1">Gowen</persName> that at the
                                meeting he had requested with the Chinese representative, he should
                                1) give him the April 2 press release; 2) reject categorically the
                                accusation of mistreatment of Chinese students in the United States;
                                3) state that the total number of Chinese students whose departure
                                had been temporarily restrained but who had left or were now
                                permitted to leave was 103 and that, except for several cases still
                                under review, no Chinese student who desired to return to the
                                mainland was being prevented from doing so; and 4) emphasize that
                                the Communist failure to take action on the cases of the detained
                                Americans was a major concern and had incurred the deep resentment
                                of the American people. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                211.9311/3–3155)</note> In doing so, I took every occasion
                            vigorously to impress upon <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Shen</persName>
                            and his associates very grave and deep indignation and resentment
                            American people and my government at pitiful plight Americans detained
                            in Red China. I bitterly deplored failure Chinese Communists furnish
                            satisfactory <pb n="468" xml:id="pg_468" facs="0496"/>and prompt
                            information re welfare these Americans and also failure explain their

                            anxiety their families. Communist treatment these Americans contrasts
                            sharply with excellent treatment, I said, consistently extended Chinese
                            students by US Government. I said treatment extended Americans in
                            Communist China is abhorrent to all principles justice, humaneness and
                            fairness.</p>
                        <p>Following every item in Department telegram 828 and stressing every point
                            I most vigorously again rejected all Communist Chinese charges about
                            alleged illegal, inhuman and oppressive treatment Chinese students.
                            Interpreter translated all I said sentence-by-sentence. <persName

                                    committed crimes must be tried and condemned according our laws.
                                    Chinese Government in all such cases is inspired and guided by
                                    principles of justice. American protests about treatment we

                                    to study and have all right return their homeland. They have

                                    and that when they are ready for it, it will be too late for us
                                    to do anything about it except to resist to the utmost. In other

                                    bring on a general war. I also think that the non-Communist
                                    world as a whole will be more disposed to respond to strength
                                    than to weakness on our part, on which statement particularly
                                    applies to Southeast Asians. I can think of no greater stimulus
                                    to Communist aggressive action than the belief on their part
                                    that the democratic nations, and particularly the US, are afraid
                                    to risk war in order to avoid it.</p>

                                    activity is more likely to involve the United States. Whether

                                    during the coming weeks and months will largely depend upon
                                    decisions which you are in the process of making in Washington:
                                    i.e., additional forces, construction of facilities, etc. I

                                    are allowed to continue their build-up through unopposed
                                    construction of airfields, depots, with concentrations of men,
                                    materials and aircraft, I would expect them to welcome a very
                                    low tempo of combat activity until they are ready to strike.
                                    When they are ready they will then strike with such a tremendous
                                    force that a most immediate and strong American retaliatory
                                    effort will be required, the decision for which must be made in
                                    Washington without delay. Under these conditions there is a much
                                    greater likelihood that success will depend upon the immediate
                                    use of atomic weapons. While I would hope that we could limit
                                    our retaliatory action to military targets near Taiwan i.e.

                            <item>The proposed solution for the offshore islands is based upon the
                                implicit conclusion that the U.S. should not participate in their
                                defense and that militarily and politically both the U.S. and the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s would be better off
                                if their prestige were not committed to the defense of the islands.
                                The solution calls for disengagement of U.S. and <gloss
                                    target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> prestige through persuasion
                                of <persName>Chiang</persName> to regard the islands as expendable
                                outposts.</item>

                            <item><persName>Chiang</persName> recognizes that his only hope of
                                achieving his paramount ambition of return to the Mainland lies in
                                large-scale U.S. military involvement with the Chinese Communists.
                                To <persName>Chiang</persName> the offshore islands are important
                                not so much for defense of Taiwan or for demonstrating Nationalist
                                military prowess but because they offer the most likely means for
                                involving the U.S. in hostilities with the Chinese Communists which
                                could expand to create his opportunity for invasion. To treat the
                                islands as expendable outposts would forfeit the prospect of such
                                U.S. military involvement. Consequently, <persName>Chiang</persName>
                                can hardly be persuaded to do so unless he is completely convinced
                                that the U.S. has no intention of participating in their defense.
                                And only a forthright public statement to the effect would be likely
                                to convince him.</item>

                            <item>Moreover, under the proposed course of action, in order not to
                                impair its own prestige and the confidence of its allies and the
                                free world, the U.S. would have to make publicly clear in advance
                                its intentions regarding the coastal islands. Even if the U.S.
                                succeeded, without a public statement, in persuading
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> to treat the islands as outposts,
                                U.S. intentions toward the islands would not be clear to U.S. or
                                free world opinion. If in such circumstances the Communists were to
                                attack the offshore islands, the proposed action would <pb n="474"
                                    xml:id="pg_474" facs="0502"/>appear to reflect timidity,
                                irresolution or weakness. U.S. opinion would be torn between the
                                belief that participation in defense of the islands was not in the
                                national interest and the feeling that we should not desert, under
                                fire, an ally who might have had some reason to expect our
                                assistance. Free world loss of confidence in U.S. resolution would
                                be acute and the neighboring countries would suffer considerably
                                greater shock to their morale than if the U.S., prior to an attack,
                                had made clear its intention not to defend the islands. Moreover,
                                failure to clarify our position in advance of an attack would
                                forfeit the chance of solidifying our allies in support for our
                                defense of Taiwan.</item>

                                participate in defense of the islands will be required both to
                                persuade <persName>Chiang</persName> to regard them as expendable
                                outposts and to prevent damaging effects upon free world support for

                            <item>From the point of view of avoiding U.S. dictation of
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>’s actions it would be preferable to
                                leave to <persName>Chiang</persName> a choice as to whether, with no
                                expectation of U.S. defense, he would prefer to hold the islands as
                                outposts or to withdraw from them. From the point of view of U.S.
                                interests, however, it would be preferable if
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> decided to withdraw. Nationalist
                                withdrawal would preclude the possibility that
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName>, even though agreeing to regard the
                                islands as outposts, would continue to work to improve the prospects
                                of subsequent U.S. involvement. Nationalist withdrawal would avoid
                                the unsettling effects upon U.S. opinion inherent, even with a prior
                                U.S. statement that it would not intervene, in standing by if the
                                Communists should actually attack. Nationalist withdrawal would
                                maximize the possibilities of securing broad international support
                                for U.S. protection of Formosa and the Pescadores.</item>

                            known that such attacks were made in agreement with us. I said that
                            after the Bandung Conference we might be able to see more clearly ahead
                            and judge either that there would be war or peace in the area. The
                            President said he was in complete agreement. He referred to the fact
                            that it is oftentimes necessary to take heavy liabilities from a purely
                            military standpoint in order to avoid being in the position of being an
                            aggressor and the initiator of war. This is a price which often has to
                            be paid and which may have to be paid in this case.</p>

                            matter with the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the rest of the
                            Commonwealth.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied that he could not give an immediate answer. The key
                            would be the attitude of the Republic of China. In fact, the issue here
                            is really the morale on Formosa. The subject has not been raised with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> and the
                            Secretary said he did not feel he could give an affirmative answer
                            before exploring the subject with the Chinese Nationalists. For its
                            part, the U.S. would consider that the added value of such a declaration
                            would more than offset the strategic value of Quemoy and the off-shore
                            islands. However, <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0506"/>he could not
                            undertake to speak for the Chinese Nationalists until after they had
                            been consulted.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSPC1">Sir Percy</persName> answered that if the
                            matter, once raised by the Australians with the British, were now
                            allowed to drop, it would be difficult to revive it later.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary repeated that he could say no more than he had already said
                            at this moment. He would, however, like to consider <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSPC1">Sir Percy</persName>’s question for a day or
                            two.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that he would prefer to wait for a considered
                            reply than accept the Secretary’s immediate reaction.<note n="2"

                        <p>The Secretary expressed doubt that the British were in any position to

                            He inquired whether <persName corresp="#p_MRG1">Menzies</persName> had

                        <p>The Ambassador indicated that he was inclined to share the Secretary’s

                            statement which the Secretary had given him just before he left
                                Washington.<note n="3" xml:id="d203fn3">Enclosed with a letter of

                            The Secretary indicated his assent. There was some brief discussion as
                            to what effect on the Bandung Conference <persName corresp="#p_MRG1"
                                >Menzies</persName>’ speech might have but there was agreement that
                            it was better to continue our normal business without regard to
                            Bandung.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSPC1">Sir Percy</persName> then inquired whether
                            or not there was any evidence that the Soviets were exercising a
                            restraining influence over the Chinese Communists in the Formosa
                            area.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said we had no evidence on this one way or the other. It
                            was a fact that Soviet military assistance in the form of guns and
                            planes were flowing in volume into China. He supposed that if they were
                            being sent there, there was the intention ultimately to use them.</p>

                            remarked that the situation in Vietnam from latest reports seemed

                            <item>On the surface the general state of Chinese Nationalist morale
                                remains fairly good despite recent events. We have not detected
                                Communist subversive activity of major proportions on Taiwan, and
                                strong countermeasures are being enforced throughout the island.
                                Nevertheless, the National Government has undergone many
                                frustrations and disappointments during its six years on Taiwan, and
                                adverse psychological forces are almost certainly at work beneath
                                the surface of Nationalist society. <hi rend="italic">(Paras. 20–21,

                            <item>The islands of Quemoy and Matsu have recently assumed such
                                importance in the eyes of the Nationalists that their loss during
                                    <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480" facs="0508"/>the current crisis
                                would be a severe blow to morale, irrespective of the circumstances
                                or conditions under which the loss occurred. The effect would
                                probably be considerably greater if the islands fell to Communist
                                attack, especially if US forces were involved, than if they were
                                evacuated without armed conflict. In any event, however, we believe
                                that the blow would not be so great as to cause the Nationalists to
                                fold up. We believe that they would continue their resistance to
                                Communist pressures, at least for a time.<note n="5"

                                    courses of Nationalist action, and would rephrase these

                                    resist or to set in motion forces that would cause the
                                    Nationalists to fold up. We believe that they would continue
                                    their resistance to Communist pressures as long as they had
                                    confidence in the determination and ability of the US to defend

                                conducting a high-pressure propaganda campaign aimed at inducing
                                defections from Taiwan and the offshore islands. This effort has

                                remains fairly good despite recent events. Aside from some
                                pessimistic editorial comment in the Nationalist-controlled press,
                                there have been few visible evidences of lowered morale. We
                                nevertheless believe that this relatively satisfactory state of
                                morale may be more apparent than real. The adverse psychological
                                forces analyzed above, in particular the disappointments over
                                certain US policies, are almost certainly at work beneath the
                                surface of Nationalist society. These forces do not appear as yet to
                                be of serious proportions, but their erosive effect may prepare the
                                way for an accelerated deterioration of morale in the event
                                Nationalist China should suffer additional setbacks.</item>

                                developments affect the Chinese Nationalist estimate of US policy.

                                perhaps the Nationalist rank-and-file, probably do not have any deep
                                conviction that the US will in fact support such a return, except in
                                the event of war between the US and Communist China. It would be a
                                different matter, however, to admit finally to themselves that a
                                cherished hope had been without foundation. We do not believe that
                                the Nationalists have yet come to such an admission, or that they
                                would be driven to it even if the offshore islands were lost and the
                                US appeared to regard the loss as final. They would be forced closer
                                to it, however, and the impact would be great among all elements on
                                Taiwan. There might not be any sudden increase in defections or
                                other manifestations of changing loyalties, but the leadership would
                                find it much more difficult to sustain its own morale and the

                                of Taiwan. While such a guarantee might give some additional
                                assurance of security, it would almost certainly be unwelcome to the
                                Nationalists because it would tend to reduce the chances of war
                                between the US and Communist China, and thus decrease the chances of
                                a return to the mainland. It would, in the Nationalist view, appear
                                to associate the US with the British “two-Chinas” policy, or even
                                indicate a drift toward international trusteeship for Taiwan.</item>

                                convinced that the US would not intervene, they might request US
                                assistance to evacuate the islands. In any event there would be
                                mounting bitterness against the US and a feeling that the US was
                                interested in holding Taiwan only for its own security. In time,

                                leadership would continue to control loyalties and limit

                                might entertain serious doubts as to US intentions with respect to
                                the defense of Taiwan, we believe that over the short term they

                        <p>I showed the President a draft of a statement of position with reference

                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and myself on
                                Saturday,<note n="3" xml:id="d207fn3">April 16.</note> which I had
                            shown to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> on
                            Sunday morning.</p>
                        <p>We discussed this paper at some length.</p>
                        <p>The President was hesitant about giving up his idea of a temporizing
                            holding of Quemoy and Matsu by the Chinese Nationalists as “outposts”.
                            He said he disagreed with <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>’s view that this was impractical. He said that
                            Malta had held out.</p>
                        <p>I expressed the view that if we were not going to allow the Chinese
                            Nationalists to attack <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>
                            build-ups before they were completed and if we were not going to help
                            the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s after they were
                            completed, then it would be better to encourage a clean break and a
                            substitute of the <gloss target="#t_SEA1">sea</gloss>
                            “interdiction”.</p>
                        <p>The President finally agreed that we would leave this up to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s. He was very insistent that we
                            should not be in the position of exerting coercion upon them, but that
                            we should make clear that <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0520"/>we
                            were not willing to have our side strike the first major blow as between
                            Formosa and the Mainland, and that also we would not defend merely
                            Quemoy and Matsu.</p>
                        <p>The President personally interlined on page 1 of Annex A a suggested
                            rewording of paragraph 2. This page with the President’s handwriting on
                            it is annexed hereto as “C”.<note n="4" xml:id="d207fn4">The President
                                did not reword paragraph 2 but added two sentences. The first two
                                sentences of paragraph 2 of Annex “E” are identical with paragraph 2
                                of Annex “A”; the last two sentences of paragraph 2 of Annex “E”
                                appear in the President’s handwriting on Annex “C”.</note></p>
                        <p>The President also felt that before we had gone into the program of
                            paragraph 5,<note n="5" xml:id="d207fn5">Similar in substance to
                                paragraph 6 of Annex “E”.</note> there should be a paragraph
                            emphasizing the importance of cooperation between the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s and ourselves to win US and
                            world opinion. He outlined what he had in mind, and I dictated it as a
                            new paragraph 5. See Annex “D”.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed some doubts about the “blockade”. I said that I
                            felt that this could clearly be justified as a measure of self-defense,
                            particularly after Quemoy and Matsu had been evacuated so that there
                            could be no question but what the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >Chicom</gloss> build-up was for an attack against Formosa, and so
                            long as we made clear that if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >Chicom</gloss> Government renounced the effort to take Formosa by
                            force, the interdiction would be lifted.</p>
                        <p>After some discussion on this matter, the President agreed.</p>
                        <p>Also, the President suggested that paragraph (a) and (b) of the program
                            should be reversed so that the “interdiction” paragraph should come
                            after a paragraph indicating that the Chinese Nationalists would first
                            take the decision as to whether or not to attempt to hold Quemoy and
                            Matsu under the conditions indicated. Paragraph 5 and the renumbered
                            paragraph 6, with subparagraphs (a) and (b) reversed, I dictated to Miss
                            Bernau in the President’s presence. They are in the above-referred-to
                            Annex D.</p>
                        <p>The President approved this with a couple of linguistic changes indicated
                            in pencil. Thereupon, the entire paper was retyped by Mrs. Whitman as
                            “E”.</p>
                        <p>After the President read over this document, he raised a question as to
                            whether the stationing of atomic capabilities on Formosa should be done
                            “with public knowledge”. He put parentheses, with a question mark,
                            around this phrase on the original.<note n="6" xml:id="d207fn6">The

                        <p>With reference to the proposed restatement of US policy, the President
                            indicated that he would be prepared to make this, although he believed
                            that in the long run, unless the unexpected happened, it <pb n="493"

                        <p>With reference to the “high level meeting” [6(e)],<note n="7"
                                xml:id="d207fn7">Brackets in the source text.</note> I said that
                            this might require him to go somewhere to meet the <persName

                        <p>The President and I had a little discussion about the question of
                            procedure and timing. He said he did not think there was any necessity
                            for Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> or Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to come down to
                            Augusta to see him, but that he thought they should proceed promptly to
                            Taipei. We both recognized that time was of the essence. I said that at
                            some stage, it would be necessary to feel out the Congressional leaders,
                            and I might in a vague way mention the project to Senator <persName

                                    >George</persName> the President’s view that the Nationalists
                                should not be authorized to attack the mainland airfields. The
                                Senator said “he supposed that was the correct course although he
                                himself was not entirely clear but what we should let the <gloss

                                concern that Quemoy and Matsu could become a “generally divisive
                                force” in the United States. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> then told the Senator in confidence that the

                                with <persName>Chiang</persName> and that “we were seeking a
                                solution which would minimize the Quemoy and Matsu aspect of the

                            but that in general I did not think there should be any disclosure until
                            it was found out whether the idea was acceptable to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>. The President asked

                            doubted whether it was wise to push the <gloss target="#t_UK1"
                                >UK</gloss> on this matter at this stage, particularly when they

                        <p>I expressed the opinion that in fact the program outlined would
                            immeasurably serve to consolidate world opinion, and the President said
                            that he shared that view.</p>
                        <p>The President authorized me to proceed accordingly.</p>

                                <item>It is the United States view that the military disadvantages
                                    of this build-up should be accepted at this time rather than
                                    that the United States now be responsible for initiating active
                                    hostilities which could readily spread into a major war. It is
                                    believed that the moral and political advantages of this
                                    avoidance of the fighting initiative offset the military
                                    disadvantages. A principal reason is the certainty that such
                                    initiation of hostilities would react unfavorably, perhaps to a
                                    decisive degree, upon American public determination to support
                                        <persName>Chiang</persName>. Neither is it part of American
                                    policy to engage in hostilities merely to defend Quemoy and the

                        <p>The Secretary requested the British Chargé to call at noon today. The
                            Secretary opened the conversation by noting that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had left this morning for
                            talks on Taiwan.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">The Department of State
                                announced on April 20 that, in view of the tense situation in the
                                Formosa area, <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> were proceeding
                                to Taipei for consultation under the Mutual Defense Treaty. For the
                                substance of the announcement, see Department of State <hi
                                    rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, May 2, 1955, p. 732.</note> They
                            would be of a general character covering both political and military
                            matters. It was expected that the talks would touch particularly on the
                            dangers inherent in the intensive build-up of the airfields on the
                            mainland opposite Taiwan. We were under considerable pressure from the
                            Chinese Nationalists to hit by air this build-up before it assumed even
                            larger proportions. We were reluctant to give our approval to such
                            action but it was admittedly awkward to refuse approval without
                            incurring some moral commitment to defend the Nationalists against a
                            later attack which might be the consequence of the build-up. The purpose
                            of the U.S. is to prevent or postpone the outbreak of major
                            hostilities.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he could not be specific but if the U.S. were
                            able “to work something out”, he would hope that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> would find it possible to make some
                            contribution to a result which would end the danger of fighting. He
                            noted that so far the Bandung Conference seemed to have gone rather
                            well. The Chinese Communists might return to Peiping lacking any feeling
                            of general Asian backing and support.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then said that there were two points or angles which he
                            would like to underline. The first related to the use of British
                            registered shipping to carry supplies such as <gloss target="#t_POL1"
                                >POL</gloss> and other strategic materials to the Chinese Communists
                            for their build-up opposite Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>There followed then some little discussion with <persName
                                corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> maintaining that the
                            British controls on the loading and transport of embargoed items at Hong
                            Kong and elsewhere were extremely tight and firmly enforced. In the
                            discussion it developed that we had more in mind cabotage operations
                            whereunder small British flag ships in the coast-wise trade might carry
                            from Hong Kong and return to Hong Kong with innocent cargoes but during
                            the course of the voyage transship <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss>
                            and such items from one Communist port to another.</p>
                        <p>In any event, the Secretary said that what would be required were more
                            restrictive measures in the area to prevent a further buildup.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said his second point was in connection with a possible
                            guarantee. If the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> could give some form
                            of guarantee or assurance covering Taiwan and the Pescadores this might
                            be a very <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0525"/>useful contribution
                            at some stage. He had gathered from the Australians that there had been
                            some talk between Canberra and London on this subject and that the
                            British response had been favorable. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir
                                Robert</persName> commented that the Embassy here was not aware of
                            the details of any such conversations.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the question of British shipping engaged in contraband
                            transport, <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> brought up
                            the case of a small British ship which had been sunk in Swatow Harbor by
                            Chinese Nationalist bombing.<note n="3" xml:id="d208fn3">The <hi

                                941.73.</note> The Nationalists had apologized and the British had
                            asked U.S. support in their effort to secure compensation. He noted that
                            the ship had entered Swatow Harbor empty and was engaged in picking up
                            foodstuffs for Hong Kong. The Secretary stated that he had been talking
                            only of strategic material. <persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir
                                Robert</persName> reiterated that the British controls were
                            effective on this.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said that they would
                            look into this matter immediately and meanwhile wondered if the
                            Secretary could be more specific on the question of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UK1">U.K.</gloss> guarantee.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary replied in the negative but remarked that he assumed that
                            it would be very difficult to do anything of this nature in the
                            pre-election period.<note n="4" xml:id="d208fn4">A British general
                                election was scheduled for May 26.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_SSRH1">Sir Robert</persName> said that speaking
                            more or less personally he felt that the British Government believed
                            that the main trouble surrounded the off-shore islands, and that they
                            would like to help achieve their evacuation. He had the impression,
                            however, that they would like to accomplish this in a way which avoided
                            a reversal of the entire British Far Eastern policy of the past six
                            years, which was fundamentally designed to achieve some sort of modus
                            vivendi with the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>In closing the conversation on this subject, the Secretary said that the
                            results of the Bandung Conference might throw some additional light on
                            Chinese Communist intentions. Their part at Bandung so far had appeared
                            mild.</p>

                                >Pride</persName>, Commander 7th Fleet, expressed himself strongly
                            in favor of the Nationalist request to blockade the mainland but
                            described bombing of the coastal airfields as “a foolish idea”. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName> pointed out that
                            losses to attacking Nationalist aircraft would be disproportionate to
                            any advantage gained by bombing the coastal airfields, which were little
                            more than runways without facilities or discernible ammunition or fuel
                            storage areas. A serious weakness of the airfields was the fact that
                            there were no railways or adequate highways leading to them;
                            consequently fuel supplies must be brought in by <gloss target="#t_SEA1"
                                >sea</gloss>. Communist use of the airfields would be virtually
                            stopped if the Nationalists cut off the coastal shipping by naval
                            blockade and air action.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_PVAAM1">Pride</persName> also commented on
                            the remarkable Communist radar coverage along the entire coastline which
                            extended to a depth of some 400 to 450 miles. The Admiral remarked that
                            during the Tachen exercise he learned of take-offs of planes from 7th
                            Fleet carriers by hearing the Communist radio reporting radar contacts
                            before messages reached him through his own communications system.</p>

                                        >Radford</persName> and dictated a message, attached to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s memorandum,
                                    labeled “President’s 1st Draft” and dated April 21. It reads as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>“The President wants me to reiterate that your mission is to
                                    induce the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                                    to propose some solution to the Formosa-Quemoy-Matsu problem
                                    that will be acceptable both to him and to us. Beyond doubt he
                                    recognizes that a strong and favorable American public opinion
                                    is necessary to his continuing existence and success. While the
                                    point could be made on your own initiative that the
                                    participation by the United States in conflict merely to save
                                    the offshore islands would cause a serious damage, if not a
                                    loss, of American public opinion, it is highly desirable that we
                                    avoid the position of urging upon him a solution in which he
                                    himself does not believe. The President agreed to the general
                                    purport of the paper that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> gave to you before your departure but he,
                                    the President, goes back to the proposition that politically and
                                    psychologically, we should lead the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                        >Generalissimo</persName> into making a proposition that
                                    will neither commit the United States to war in defense of the
                                    offshore islands nor will constitute an implied repudiation of
                                    the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> by this
                                    government.</p>
                                <p>“These are the reasons that the President has so much favored an
                                    outpost conception for the offshore islands, highly organized
                                    and well supported by <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                        >Chiang</persName>’s main forces and with assurances to him
                                    of the additional American help, as well as other general
                                    commitments, that you already know about.</p>
                                <p>“Under no circumstances should there be allowed to develop an
                                    atmosphere which would preclude further conversations and
                                    negotiations.”</p>
                                <p>“The Secretary’s message will emphasize the need for sympathetic
                                    understanding in dealing with <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                        >Chiang</persName>.”</p>
                                <p><persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s memorandum states
                                    that he thought that “there were so many inconsistencies between
                                    this message and the instructions which had been given to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, that it
                                    would be impossible for them to carry out their mission without
                                    an entirely new approach.” He and Deputy Secretary of Defense
                                        <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> redrafted
                                    the message and gave it to the President, who made further
                                    revisions in it. This draft, as revised by the President, is
                                    also attached to <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s

                        <p>[Message No. 2.] The President returned to Washington and in conversation
                            expressed himself along the following lines:</p>
                        <p>He reiterated that your mission is to find in conversation and mutual
                            exploration some solution to the Formosa–Quemoy–Matsu problem that will
                            be acceptable both to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> and
                            to US. Beyond doubt the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> recognizes that a strong and favorable
                            American public opinion is necessary to his continuing existence and
                            future success. While the point could be made on your own initiative <pb
                                n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0530"/>that the participation by the
                            United States in conflict merely to save the offshore islands would
                            cause a serious damage, if not a loss, of American public opinion, it is
                            highly desirable that we avoid the position of urging upon him a
                            solution which he cannot accept.</p>
                        <p>The President is anxious that an area of understanding be reached that
                            politically and psychologically avoids any indication of a lessening of
                            our interest in the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                            and at the same time achieves his recognition of the fact that the
                            United States cannot be committed because of reasons important both to
                            him and to this country to going to war in defense of the offshore
                            islands. If the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName>
                            thought it necessary or desirable, he probably could reorganize the
                            island defense so as to diminish markedly the numbers involved and
                            depend mainly on field fortifications and intensive firepower for the
                            islands’ defense supported by his own air and naval forces. With such an
                            arrangement and with United States forces contributing to the defense of
                            Formosa proper he could inflict tremendous losses on any attackers of
                            the offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>Under no circumstances should there be allowed to develop an atmosphere
                            which could preclude further conversations and negotiations, nor should
                            there be any appearance of trying to force the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> to adopt a course which
                            is unacceptable to him.</p>
                        <p>The President further asked me to convey his warm personal greetings to
                            the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> and Madame
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-Shek</persName>, and to tell
                            them how intensively and sympathetically he has studied this and its
                            related problems.</p>

                                >Robertson</persName> on their departure—the idea apparently being
                            to avoid the use of the term “blockade,” because of its closely defined
                            international significance, in favor of a more flexible term such as
                            “maritime zone.”</p>
                        <p>There was discussion of the military feasibility of instituting and
                            maintaining such control, with mines, surface vessels, air support,
                            etc.—this in conjunction with the feasibility of and support
                            requirements for any attempt to evacuate <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"

                                >ChiCom</gloss> attack from the forward islands. There was also
                            discussion of the legality of the “maritime zone” proposal. It was
                            brought out that the proposal could only be effective with full
                            cooperation of <persName>Chiang</persName>.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that the considerations are so elusive that the
                            matter is difficult to put into writing. He is hoping that
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> comes to see the value of changing his
                            stand voluntarily; <persName>Chiang</persName> must realize that his
                            greatest asset in his present situation is U.S. public opinion. He felt
                            that the “maritime zone” proposal could not be considered, except after
                            a voluntary evacuation from the offshore islands or their capture after
                            serving as out-posts. The President stressed, however, he did not wish
                            to force <persName>Chiang</persName> into anything for which the U.S.
                            would then be responsible, but wanted <persName>Chiang</persName>’s
                            decision to be made voluntarily. He regarded the islands as being fairly
                            valuable and appropriate for defense with small forces, supported to the
                            maximum with mines and obstacles and other artificial items, and given

                                shore in shoal water. Its volume and traffic pattern make it
                                impossible to control by visit and search. Interdiction involves
                                surface penetration and continued operations in waters close to
                                coast. Interdiction ocean shipping feasible but there is very little
                                such in this area. Reaction to interdiction could include minor
                                surface operations, submarine operations and air attack. Air threat
                                most significant. Continuation of operations in face of such threats
                                requires appropriate destruction of enemy air capability.
                                Maintenance of cap by carrier air over interdicting forces for
                                extended periods neither desirable nor practicable. Possible
                                expansion enemy air operations should be viewed in light present

                                insurmountable problem and second opposed evacuation. Latter could

                            considered the legal status of a Zone of Defense in the Formosa Straits
                            area and found no precedents for such a zone. However we consider that
                            there is nothing in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> Charter or
                            in international law which prohibits such a zone. Interference with
                            vessels of third parties will no doubt be challenged and while our legal
                            right to do so is doubtful we feel that it can be justified as a matter
                            of self-defense. A blockade is permissible only in time of war, or when
                            authorized by the United Nations and therefore the use of that term
                            should be avoided, as the measure under discussion is defensive and not
                            intended as an act of war. The following is submitted as a basis of
                            discussion but would of course have no application except after
                            voluntary evacuation of the offshore islands or their capture while

                                    desirous of bringing peace to the world. In the Formosa region
                                    we have an ally in the Free Republic of China and of course the

                                    within the country and it could place an immediate cease-fire in

                        <p>After some discussion of the matter in the Department, Mr. <persName

                            issue a statement. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            pointed out that the <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            statement was merely issued as a press release by the Chinese Delegation
                            at Bandung. The British had commented on it only through a Foreign
                            Office press release. It would dignify the statement unduly for the
                            President to comment on it directly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName> suggested that a statement, substantially as
                            drafted by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> but with
                            certain changes recommended by the Department, be issued as a
                            Departmental press release. After some further consideration of the
                            matter Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJC1">Hagerty</persName> agreed to the
                            drafting changes suggested by the Department and also agreed that it
                            should be put out as a Departmental press release. The statement (Tab

                                    Republic of China and of course the United States would insist
                                    on free China participating as an equal in any discussions

                                    would be to place in effect in the area an immediate cease-fire.
                                    It could also immediately release the American airmen and others
                                    whom it unjustly holds. Another could be the acceptance of the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s proposal apparently was
                            designed to leave the Bandung conferees with the impression that
                            Communist China, without modifying in the slightest its basic demands
                            for the “liberation” of Taiwan and the liquidation of the Government of
                            the Republic of China, had gone more than half-way in a constructive
                            effort to relax tensions over Taiwan. It was designed, as were the
                            Chinese Communist tactics at Geneva, to establish a basis for throwing
                            the onus for Far Eastern tensions on the United States, thus enabling
                            the Communist propagandists to utilize the fear of war as a means of
                            isolating the United States.</p>
                        <p>Initial reactions from abroad indicate at least partial success for
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s tactic. Bandung
                            conferees were reportedly “stunned” by this “reversal” of Chinese
                            Communist policy. The British reaction, while reflecting skepticism
                            about <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s real intentions,
                            makes it likely <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>that allied
                            reaction to a “negative” American attitude toward the proposal will be
                            at best one of mild disappointment. Various foreign reactions are

                            to state in beginning (1) that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> would not be party to neutralization plan for

                            that US will continue look upon National Government as lawful government
                            of China and only alternative to Red China for millions mainland and

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> continued situation now
                            one which might well lead to war involving atomic weapons. If war came
                            it was essential that US, which must bear large share responsibility,
                            enter war with full support US public opinion and world opinion to
                            greatest extent possible. To insure such support President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> convinced it essential (1)
                            that US and <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s not strike first
                            blow, and (2) that if US goes to war it will be in defense of Formosa
                            and not off-shore islands.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> convinced
                            that both US and world opinion can be marshalled behind war in defense
                            Formosa. Such opinion can not in his opinion be marshalled in support of
                            war in defense offshore islands. We should like emphasize overriding
                            importance world opinion. If hostilities should bring Russia into war we
                            would require use bases in other countries which might be denied US
                            unless countries concerned supported our position. If Communists
                            continue buildup airfields unchecked they will eventually dominate air
                            over Quemoy–Matsu making them indefensible. If <gloss

                            />would bring down upon our heads the charge that we are aggressors in
                            starting war. Weighing all these factors, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> with reluctance has come to
                            decision that military disadvantages of unchecked buildup should be
                            accepted at this time rather than we should be held responsible for
                            initiating active hostilities which could readily spread to major war.
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> strongly
                            feels that the moral and political advantages of avoiding the initiative
                            if [<hi rend="italic">in</hi>] the fighting would more than offset the
                            military disadvantages.</p>
                        <p>Problem is how can we meet this situation without seriously impairing the
                            defensibility of treaty area without (a) loss of the value of
                            Quemoy–Matsu as defensive outposts, (b) serious loss of <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss> troops and valuable equipment,

                            US. Obviously only solution lies in finding substitute for islands which
                            would strengthen rather than weaken overall position. President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> wished to
                            emphasize that this was problem to be talked out with Gimo without

                            all circumstances as outlined Gimo would agree to evacuation
                            Quemoy–Matsu US would provide cover such evacuation and President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would publicly

                                    striking first blow whereas interdiction would put Communists

                            </list></p>
                        <p>Gimo stated <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s will honor all
                            treaty obligations and keep all promises such as not attack mainland
                            without US consent. He was not in position to consider any undertaking
                            which might place his government in bad light with his own people. He
                            had agreed to evacuation Tachens but he will defend Quemoy–Matsu with or
                            without US help. Therefore, he cannot accept US proposal. He is fully
                            aware of danger of <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> buildup but
                            is prepared to take risk of receiving full onslaught of attack rather
                            than give up two positions which would go against best Chinese tradition
                            of patriotism. If <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"/>he abandoned
                            Quemoy–Matsu Chinese people would lose respect this government.
                            Speculation in US press indicates US decision has already been made
                            which has placed <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss> Government in
                            untenable position. Soldiers must choose proper places to die. Chinese
                            soldiers consider Quemoy–Matsu are proper places for them.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated US government
                            could not be held responsible for speculation in press. Question here
                            was not one of US decision whether Quemoy–Matsu should be held but
                            whether US should participate in their defense. If Gimo decided to
                            defend islands US will continue give logistical support. US does not
                            presume tell <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s what they must
                            do. He reiterated that if situation evolved into larger war it would be
                            essential US Government have full support of both political parties and
                            of American people. This would not be possible if we should enter war in
                            defense Quemoy–Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Gimo reiterated he would defend own territory but would carry out treaty
                            obligations. He had no right to inquire what US would actually do but
                            would like to know whether US had changed mind or altered policy
                            relative assistance in defense of Quemoy–Matsu.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had in fact
                            changed his mind with reference to US participation in defense of
                            Quemoy-Matsu which was his intention under circumstances prevailing at
                            time of his January 31 message. However President had not come to this
                            conclusion lightly. He made new proposal with sincere feeling of
                            offering solution which would best serve purpose free China and US.
                            There was no question that if US assisted <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >Chinat</gloss>s we had military power to hold Quemoy–Matsu. However
                            in addition to consideration of striking first blow it would undoubtedly
                            be necessary to use atomic weapons. If these were used President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would have to
                            consider feeling generated throughout the world and in China too,
                            particularly if many civilians were killed. He was sure Gimo could well
                            appreciate terrible responsibilities of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> in this regard. Furthermore
                            we must both recognize that Russia is a principal enemy and US must not
                            jeopardize its ability to cope successfully with Russian military power
                            in event of major war. Our considerations must include factor of allied
                            bases and hence allied opinion.</p>
                        <p>Gimo asked whether President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> has considered psychological effect on rest
                            of free Asians if US proposal adopted. He mentioned that at the time of
                            withdrawal from Tachens President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> had indicated US would assist in defense of
                            Quemoy–Matsu. New proposal now involved abandoning more territory
                            Quemoy–Matsu to Communist. This will have grave psychological reactions
                            throughout Asia detracting from position of US as leader if latter will
                            not hold line against Communist. Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> interjected to ask whether a defense of Quemoy–Matsu
                            required use atomic <pb n="513" xml:id="pg_513" facs="0541"/>weapons or
                            whether a defense could not be accomplished with conventional weapons
                            alone.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that from
                            military standpoint he could not guarantee their defense without use
                            atomic weapons. At this point Gimo suggested short break and he and
                            Madame <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> withdrew.</p>
                        <p>Conversation continued <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            reiterating salient points to Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> and asking if he (<persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName>) thought <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> fully appreciated US position as to
                            importance of US and world opinion and implications of US proposal.
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> recalled the
                            psychological reactions to the evacuation of the Tachens, at which time
                            indications were US would assist defending Quemoy–Matsu. US now
                            apparently reneging on this understanding although this is not publicly
                            known. He indicated that further evacuation by military forces would
                            result in loss of morale and deterioration government position. He said
                            he felt that to lose islands in battle would be less serious in effect
                            upon morale than evacuation without fight. He mentioned that overseas
                            press had predicted US would pressure Gimo give up Quemoy-Matsu. This in
                            itself had had serious effect upon morale.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that proposal
                            for joint interdiction would represent position of strength—not
                            weakness—and involved serious commitment on the part US Government. He
                            reiterated that interdiction would likely be more effective in long run
                            than holding islands. He urged that Gimo give full consideration to US
                            position and to all implications of interdiction proposal. If Gimo
                            should accept proposal announcement would be more effective if it
                            followed meeting between President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> and Gimo in some mutually agreed upon place.
                            Gimo should not assume US is abandoning its obligations to the free
                            world. Problem should be considered as whole not in isolated parts.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> expressed doubts as to the
                            effectiveness of limited interdiction in interfering with <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss> buildup. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated that measures could
                            be taken to stop junk traffic and added that Communists as a matter of
                            fact would find it difficult to accept what would amount to a blockade
                            of their coast. (<persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed
                            out that recently <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s have lost
                            much support in world opinion which US seeks to restore.)</p>
                        <p>At this point President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            returned to conference. He stated that he would now give his answer to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s proposal.
                            He fully comprehends military and political reasons for US plan
                            including intention of offsetting bad influence of evacuation of Quemoy
                            and Matsu by including the specific proposal involving interdiction of
                            Chinese Communist seaborne traffic. He is particularly sympathetic to
                            position that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> be supported by public opinion in US. He
                            fully appreciates President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>’s <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0542"
                            />difficulties. As an ally he cannot disregard President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s domestic problems. As
                            proof of his spirit he would like to recall circumstances of agreement
                            to withdraw from Tachens. This originally included on part of US public
                            announcement that US would participate in defense of Quemoy and Matsu.
                            Subsequently, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> had explained to him why he was not able to
                            make such an announcement. Gimo had accepted President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s word that US would
                            participate in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu without such public
                            announcement. In his relations with US he had always been guided by
                            principle that where matters were in doubt China should be loser rather
                            than US. He does not want US to be embarrassed. He had made this clear
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> during course
                            of his last meeting with Secretary. He had no desire to involve us in
                            any armed conflict on behalf of Government of China. He does not want to
                            see us lose prestige or lose in any way by becoming so involved.</p>
                        <p>Recently he and Madame <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> made
                            trip to Quemoy and Matsu. During this trip he realized that Chinese
                            Communists could attack these islands any time. It was not necessary for
                            them to wait completion of airfield development program in vicinity.
                            Chinese Communists were not building fields along China Coast in
                            preparation for attack on Quemoy and Matsu, but rather to attack Formosa
                            and to prepare for general conflict. He has concluded that Communists
                            will not attack Quemoy and Matsu in immediate future. It is his judgment
                            that when and if they attack Quemoy and Matsu they will also attack
                            Taiwan at same time. They would not attack Quemoy and Matsu simply as an
                            independent action. Thus there is no need to get jittery or to worry
                            over these two islands or buildup on Chinese Coast at this time.</p>
                        <p>If at this time and in absence of state of war Chinese Nationalists were
                            to withdraw from Quemoy and Matsu they would suffer loss of prestige
                            vis-à-vis overseas Chinese, free people throughout South Asia, and in
                            their own armed forces which could not be offset. Unfortunately, Quemoy
                            and Matsu have become a touchstone (symbol) of US prestige in Far East
                            and if US urges his Government to abandon these islands the effect on
                            Asiatics throughout world and on US prestige would be very bad.</p>
                        <p>Some time ago he had talked with <persName>Roy Howard</persName>, whom he
                            had informed that Chinese Communists would not launch an attack in
                            Quemoy and Matsu without green light from <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>. They would not attack unless <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss> was prepared to fight world war. The Soviet Union is
                            not so prepared at this time. The Gimo reiterated that if he were to
                            fight on Quemoy and Matsu and were he defeated it would not be so
                            shameful as to abandon these positions without a fight. <pb n="515"
                                xml:id="pg_515" facs="0543"/>This is in consonance with Chinese
                            tradition which is shared by all the overseas Chinese.</p>
                        <p>Gimo cannot believe that interdiction would serve as an offset to
                            abandonment of Quemoy and Matsu, particularly in view of ineffectiveness
                            of blockade in application and because of precedent of halfhearted
                            manner of carrying out earlier United Nations embargo on shipment of
                            goods to Communist China. He has not examined details of interdiction
                            proposal but pointed out that while limited blockade might slow down
                            buildup on Chinese Coast it could not prevent it.</p>
                        <p>When Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> was in
                            Washington, Gimo had pointed out to him that evacuation of Tachens would
                            ultimately lead to proposal to withdraw from Quemoy and Matsu. He
                            predicted that British pressure on certain elements in US would
                            inevitably lead to such proposal. Inasmuch as his Government has
                            announced its own determination to defend these islands if they were now
                            to abandon them, could anyone believe that Formosa itself would actually
                            be held. He thinks not. If his forces pulled out of Quemoy and Matsu,
                            even a child would not believe that his Government would be assisted by
                            US in holding Taiwan itself. If he abandoned Quemoy and Matsu, it would
                            only lead to further pressure for establishment of a trusteeship for
                            Formosa.</p>
                        <p>Speaking among friends and in greatest confidence, Gimo stated that if
                            decision were to be made by Chinese Government to abandon Quemoy and
                            Matsu none of Chinese people would support Government’s decision. He
                            would be unable to lead them, and the United States would have to find
                            another <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>—adding
                            that US would be unable to find another leader who is such a friend to
                            America or as anti-Communist as he is.</p>
                        <p>In order maintain his own position and more important the confidence and
                            trust of his people in General <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>, the Gimo will defend those islands. Thus, he
                            will defend President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                            >Eisenhower</persName>’s position throughout the Far East for in reality
                            he places it of greater importance than his own. There will be many ways
                            to counter Communist aggression in Far East if President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> trusts Gimo. He will be very
                            happy to talk to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>, but this proposal itself can be described in
                            a Chinese simile, “Trying to bore without a buffalo’s horns—it gets
                            nowhere.”</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated he would like to
                            set record straight relative to conversations in Washington in January
                            regarding evacuation of Tachens. During exploratory conversations
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had advised
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that in event
                            Gimo decided evacuate Tachens President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> would consider public announcement US would
                            assist defense Quemoy–Matsu. However, before decision had been made as
                            to evacuation Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            informed Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> that
                            President <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0544"/><persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> had concluded that public
                            announcement would be inadvisable, although US under present
                            circumstances would assist in such defense. Secretary made it clear to
                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName>, however, that the
                            commitment of US to participate in defense of Quemoy and Matsu was a
                            unilateral decision on part of United States and could be withdrawn by
                            United States at any time United States considered conditions had
                            changed and without charge bad faith.</p>
                        <p>In his message of January 31, President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> had confirmed that under the then prevailing
                            circumstances he would come to aid of Chinese Nationalists if major
                            attack were made against Quemoy and Matsu. Now, however, there has built
                            up US tremendous opposition to United States participating in defense of
                            offshore islands. This opposition is prevalent both in Congress and in
                            large sections public opinion. Therefore, <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> is informing Gimo today that circumstances
                            have changed and that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> could not now use US forces in defense of
                            these islands without large loss public support at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>Gimo stated he understood present situation. He had agreed to pull out
                            Tachens because at the time he was given assurance by United States that
                            it would assist in defense of Quemoy and Matsu. As a result, he had made
                            pledges to his people. If United States feels that situation has changed
                            United States has perfect right to alter its decision. From his own
                            standpoint, he considers that military situation itself is unchanged
                            even though he recognizes that domestic political situation in United
                            States may have changed.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s support of
                            Chinese Nationalist Government has not changed. He desires to render
                            support in manner which will have full endorsement of American people
                            rather than cause great division of US public opinion at this critical
                            time. He reiterated that if President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>’s proposal were accepted it was his firm
                            belief that the Gimo would gain more friends and more support.</p>
                        <p>The Gimo concluded by stating that he would like to go along with any
                            plan by which prestige would gain, but he does not believe in this
                            specific proposal. Gimo stated that Communists would welcome such a
                            plan, to which both <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed
                            astonished disagreement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> concluded by urging Gimo
                            not dismiss US proposal without further serious consideration. It is
                            very sincere and very significant proposal. He hopes Gimo will give it
                            his full consideration.</p>
                        <p>Meeting adjourned at about 8 p.m. for dinner. Following dinner Gimo
                            indicated quite firmly that he considered his answer to have been
                            definitive and that he did not desire to resume discussions for the
                            present.</p>

                        <p>Conversation continued with Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> alone. He stated that Gimo had not anticipated any
                            proposal from US which would involve abandoning Quemoy and Matsu to
                            Communists inasmuch as Gimo was so firmly convinced that he had been
                            given positive assurance by President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> that US would participate in their defense
                            under conditions such as now existed.</p>

                            that in essence the reaction of the <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Generalissimo</persName> was negative to the proposals that have
                            been put up to him. The President said that he was sorry that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> did not find any merit in the
                            “outpost” theory and said that he himself had never expected that the
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Generalissimo</persName> would give up
                            outright on Quemoy and the Matsus.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the statement made by <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> at Bandung and the State Department statement
                            which had been issued on Saturday. I said I thought that we should be
                            prepared to indicate receptivity to any “cease fire” proposal and that
                            our Asian friends at Bandung who had brought about the apparently more
                            pacific mood on the part of the Chinese Communists would expect this of
                            us. The President agreed that I should take this line at my press

                        <p>At a press conference on April 26, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> made a statement which reads in part as follows:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Bandung Conference, as we had hoped, seems to have exerted a
                                    restraint on the Chinese Communists. I had always felt that it
                                    would be salutary if the Chinese Communists were confronted with
                                    the opinion of the free nations of Asia. That opinion was
                                    powerfully expressed in favor of peace and against direct and
                                    indirect aggression. There seems now a chance that the Communist
                                    Chinese may be deterred from pursuing the course of violence
                                    which has characterized their action in relation to Korea, to
                                    Tibet, to Indochina, and, more recently, in relation to the
                                    Taiwan (Formosa) Straits.</p>
                                <p>“The Chinese Communists found no backing for their announced
                                    program of seizing Taiwan (Formosa) by force. On the contrary,
                                    they felt it useful in the last hours of the Bandung Conference
                                    to propose to negotiate a peaceful settlement. Whether or not
                                    that was a sincere proposal remains to be seen. Perhaps the
                                    Chinese Communists were merely playing a propaganda game. But we
                                    intend to try to find out. In doing so we shall not, of course,
                                    depart from the path of fidelity and honor toward our ally, the
                                    Republic of China.”</p>

                        <p>In response to questions, the Secretary indicated that the United States
                            would be willing to enter multilateral or bilateral discussions with the
                            Chinese Communists without the presence of the Nationalists, although,
                            he stated, “We are not going to deal with the rights of the Chinese
                            Nationalists, and their claims, in their absence.” In response to
                            another question, he replied: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The first thing is to find out whether there is a possibility of
                                    a cease-fire in the area. That is a matter which can be
                                    discussed perhaps bilaterally, or at the United Nations, or
                                    possibly under other circumstances. But I regard a cease-fire as
                                    the indispensable prerequisite to anything further. When you get
                                    into further matters, then the interests of the Chinese
                                    Nationalists would naturally come to play a very large
                                    part.”</p>

                            but that this should not affect “the just demand of the Chinese people

                                    Chinese Communists, to renounce their ambitions. We don’t expect
                                    that to be done any more than we expect that to happen in the
                                    case of Germany or Korea or Viet-Nam. But even though they
                                    retain their ambitions—retain their claims—they might renounce
                                    the use of force to satisfy their claims and their ambitions.
                                    Now I don’t know whether what <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                        En-lai</persName> said was intended to be responsive to what
                                    I had previously said on that phase of the matter, or not. That
                                    is one of the things which I think deserves further
                                    exploration.”</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> on 25. Substance
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>We surprised <persName>Chiang</persName>’s reaction to proposal as
                            meaningless and his statement Communists would welcome it. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> repeated
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> meant give up islands without struggle
                            welcome to Communists and interdiction not offset disadvantages. We
                            pointed out lowered <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> prestige
                            throughout world and fact some allies might leave us if provoked too
                            far. Made point active United States support main factor keeping <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> prestige from going lower. United
                            States and world opinion strongly against war. US Government and
                            Congress sensitive to public opinion and successful policy must have
                            public support.</p>
                        <p>Any act of <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s or United States
                            and <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s which precipitates war
                            will set public opinion against us. We think if proposal accepted and
                            announced at <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName>–<persName>Chiang</persName> meeting most of
                            our allies will get behind us. Stressed fact that interdiction very
                            serious step and one which might evoke Communist reaction. Said that war
                            evolved we would be on defensive side and be backed by United States and
                            allied opinion.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> said he not think
                            interdiction would hurt Communists much nor did he think it would bring
                            any Communist reaction except talk. Said he sure present Communist peace
                            offensive will continue until they sure cannot detach Formosa by talk,
                            then they will attack; not before. He pointed out
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> plus all of Cabinet have publicly
                            pledged to defend off-shore islands and would lose support at home and
                            with overseas Chinese if evacuated without fight. Said with bigger air
                            force <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s could hold islands
                            several months even though would eventually lose them. Felt loss after
                            fight better politically than evacuation.</p>
                        <p>We stated we willing stay for further talks with
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> if desirable or leave now if no further
                            talks desired.</p>
                        <p>No opportunity for more than general talk after dinner last night.
                            Meeting tonight for what may be final conversation. Unless otherwise
                            instructed may leave for States tomorrow (Wednesday). No word from you

                        <p><persName>Chiang</persName>’s answer to the specific proposal made is not
                            only what I predicted but what I think I would have made had I been in
                            his place. As long as our representatives did not feel they could
                            suggest any attractive position between evacuation on the one hand and a
                            “fight to the death” on the other, there was no possibility of a meeting
                            of minds. For one thing there was left no way by which
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> could possibly save face.</p>
                        <p>I had hoped that the Gimo himself might have seen the wisdom of trimming
                            the garrison on the offshore islands down to the leanest fighting weight
                            possible, organizing them highly, and in the meantime making the
                            necessary public statements that would clearly set forth his
                            determination to fight for the islands’ positions, but <hi rend="italic"
                                >not</hi> to make them the sine qua non of the <gloss

                            that while he was doing this, if he could be assured of our reinforcing
                            Formosa with air, some marines and logistics, that he would have been in
                            better position both politically and militarily than he now is.
                            Certainly this would have been better for us.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, possible that no presentation could have brought
                                <persName>Chiang</persName> to recognizing the wisdom of some
                            arrangement as this—much less to propose it. But it is clear that as
                            long as <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> themselves could not grasp
                            the concept, we simply were not going to get anywhere, and there is
                            nothing in the cables to suggest that such a thought was discussed.</p>
                        <p>So, in a sense, we are still on the horns of the dilemma that you and I
                            have discussed a number of times.</p>

                        <p>Gimo indicated he understood fully details and implications of our
                            proposal. He stated primary consideration was one of confidence and
                            trust, secondly that any proposal must be within reasonable bounds of
                            compliance to each party. He lacked faith in US ability to adhere in
                            face of outside pressures to proposed interdiction of seaborne traffic
                            after having given up islands. The abandonment of his little remaining
                            territory at this time would be completely unacceptable to his people
                            and to overseas Chinese everywhere shattering their confidence in him as
                            well as United States.</p>

                            at point where further concessions would lead to ultimate calamity. He
                            did not question motives of United States in past or in present
                            situation but indicated very strongly and emotionally his conviction
                            that further concessions impossible.</p>
                        <p>While <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and I did best to
                            gain approval, we were unable to sway Gimo from his rejection of our
                            proposal. Separately Madame <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> and Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> informed us Gimo’s decision unshakable.</p>
                        <p>Gimo concluded by requesting that I convey to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> his great respect and
                            personal faith in US motives, but offered his humble apology for not
                            being able to go along with proposal give up Quemoy–Matsu which would be
                            “surrender to Communists which would endanger support of overseas
                            Chinese and his own people.”</p>

                            President has altered his earlier decision and will not use US military
                            forces in defense offshore islands. Para 3. Gimo reiterated several
                            times he would abide by obligations mutual defense treaty and would not
                            attack mainland airfield buildup without US consent. Para 4. If you
                            refer to President’s earlier idea the answer is in negative. Gimos firm
                            opposition to withdrawal strength from islands precluded such
                            exploration.</p>
                        <p>Gimo and <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> clearly understand
                            US military forces will not be used in defense of offshore islands. They
                            strongly urge and hope however that President will not make announcement
                            to this effect <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0553"/>either publicly
                            or to members of Congress. If his decision should leak they consider it
                            would mean green light to Communists to attack. We are departing

                            several times mentioned to him fact that Chinese and American Consuls

                                Telephone Conversations)</note> I gave them the background of the
                            position I had taken with reference to the <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-lai</persName> statement on negotiating with the United
                            States, namely, that:</p>
                        <p>The buildup of airfields was going ahead and unless interfered with would
                            create a situation where the Chinese would have air dominance over
                            Quemoy and Matsu in the absence of an all-out United States atomic
                            attack.</p>
                        <p>The President was very reluctant to authorize the Chinese Nationalists to
                            hit the airfields in their development stage with United States planes
                            based upon Formosa. This would seem in the nature of “preventive war”
                            and make us seem responsible for the hostilities which would doubtless
                            ensue.</p>
                        <p>The President was also reluctant to see a wholesale use of atomic weapons
                            against the densely populated mainland where land bursts would be
                            required which would have a fall-out which might involve <pb n="527"
                                xml:id="pg_527" facs="0555"/>heavy casualties. This might alienate
                            Asian opinion and ruin <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>’s hopes of ultimate welcome back to the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, it seemed that diplomacy and not merely force might be
                            required to avoid a misfortune of considerable proportions in relation
                            to the coastal positions which might either be lost or only held at a
                            prohibitive cost.</p>
                        <p>I went on to speak about the Bandung Conference, of the feeling which I
                            had had that the Conference would either give the Chinese Communists the
                            “green light” to go ahead with force to seize the coastal positions and
                            perhaps Formosa, or that the Conference might set up restraints upon the
                            Chinese Communists. I said that we had worked very hard to produce the
                            latter result and that our friends had pitched in and done a job which
                            had led <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> to follow a pacific
                            rather than belligerent course. They felt pleased with the result and a
                            complete turn-down by the United States would alienate our Asian
                            non-Communist friends and allies.</p>
                        <p>The combination of these considerations led me to feel that we should be
                            prepared to talk with the Chinese Communists merely to the extent of
                            ascertaining whether they would make a “cease fire”.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that the Chinese Nationalists in return for getting the
                            Security Treaty had in effect authorized us to bring about a cease fire
                            in that they for their side had agreed not to attack unless they were
                            attacked or unless we agreed to their attack on the mainland. Therefore,
                            all that remained was to find out whether the Chinese Communists would
                            do the same. As far as the substance of the rights of the Chinese
                            Nationalists was concerned, we made it perfectly clear that we would not
                            deal with those rights behind the backs of the Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>Senator <persName corresp="#p_KSWF1">Knowland</persName> indicated the
                            feeling that Senator <persName corresp="#p_GSWF1">George</persName> was
                            being excessively deferred to and that the Republicans in the Senate
                            were being too much ignored. He also felt that we could not trust a
                            cease-fire agreement and that the Armistices in Korea and Indochina were
                            already being broken.</p>
                        <p>While I did not feel that my presentation had convinced the Senators,
                            except perhaps Senator <persName>Smith</persName>, the meeting was
                            cordial and in good spirits.</p>
                        <p rend="right">April 28, 1955.</p>
                        <p>I met again in my office this morning with Senator <persName>Alexander
                                Smith</persName>. We reviewed somewhat what I had said the evening
                            before. Senator <persName>Smith</persName> asked whether what we had in
                            mind would tie our hands in the event there was a resumption of fighting
                            in Korea or Indochina. I said I thought that any “cease fire” for the
                            Formosa area should be contingent upon non-aggression by the Chinese
                            Communists <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0556"/>elsewhere. Senator
                                <persName>Smith</persName> said he thought it was an important point
                            that we should keep open a threat to the center in order to protect the
                            two flanks.</p>

                        <p>[Message No. 10.] I am greatly concerned over repercussions in Taiwan if
                            and when US decision not to assist in defense Quemoy and Matsu becomes
                            known.</p>
                        <p>Evacuation of Tachens very unpopular move and was strongly opposed in
                            Cabinet. Gimo forced decision on what he termed “personal word of
                            President to assist in defense of Quemoy–Matsu in lieu of public
                            announcement first expected.” Gimo fully understood US was not making
                            permanent commitment to defend islands thus enlarging treaty area, but
                            he confided to <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> “that never
                            in his darkest moments did he expect US to alter decision as to
                            immediate situation.” Aside from difficulty of conditioning Cabinet and
                            public to idea of abandonment of islands, interdiction proposal did not
                            appeal because Gimo feared US “would again back away under allied
                            pressure.”</p>
                        <p>When we left Taipei, US decision not commit US forces in defense of
                            islands had not been communicated to Cabinet. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> greatly worried how situation is
                            to be handled and is particularly anxious that no US announcement be
                            made at this time. I strongly urge that US accede to his request. Gimo
                            does not control either Cabinet or party to extent generally thought and
                            we are dealing with highly explosive situation which could seriously
                            jeopardize US interests in the Far East.</p>

                                    >Document 207</ref>.</note> The essential proposal in the
                            memorandum was that if the Nationalists should withdraw from Kinmen and
                            Matsu, the United States would be prepared to join with them in
                            establishing a defense zone along the China Coast, from Swatow to
                            Wenchow, in which the movement of all seaborne traffic of a contraband
                            or war-making character would be interdicted. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that it was proposed to
                            lay mine fields which would force coastwise junk traffic to come out
                            where it also could be intercepted and controlled.</p>
                        <p>I remarked that this proposal meant war.<note n="4" xml:id="d230fn4">My
                                concurrence in General <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1"
                                    >Chase</persName>’s recommendation of April 8, 1955, that the
                                China Coast be “blockaded” from Swatow to the Chekiang border,
                                envisaged direct action only by Chinese Nationalist forces, in
                                continuation and intensification of their “port closure”, with full
                                logistic (including ships, as necessary) and avowed moral support
                                from the United States. Direct participation of the United States
                                Navy in an effective blockade, under whatever name, would have been
                                very definitely in order during the Korean hostilities, in my
                                opinion. Since the 1953 armistice, however, it may be questioned
                                whether any occasion has arisen under which such action could be
                                justified before world opinion. At the very least, a convincing
                                public explanation by the United States Government of the developing
                                Communist threat to Kinmen–Matsu–Penghu–Taiwan would be required.

                                xml:id="pg_530" facs="0558"/>Communists could not now accept a
                            partial blockade of their coast by U.S. Forces, if only for reasons of
                            face. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated
                            agreement, adding that it would be only a matter of time until their
                            aircraft attacked our ships. He had expressed this opinion quite clearly
                            to President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>.</p>
                        <p>They asked me about President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName>’s prospective reception of the new proposal. I
                            replied that his first reaction would be one of surprise that the United
                            States was withdrawing its assurance of support in the defense of Kinmen
                            and Matsu. He had persuaded himself that no change in the situation had
                            occurred which could possibly justify such a course. His general
                            reaction would be against the new proposal. Whether they eventually
                            could win him over with the shipping interdiction scheme, I did not
                            know.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then raised the question
                            of whether I should accompany them when they presented the proposal to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. He did not
                            expect me to support a position with which I disagreed. I said that I
                            ought to go with them, and that of course I would say nothing against
                            the proposal during the conversations with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> asked me to accompany them.</p>
                        <p>The talks with President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            have been fully reported elsewhere. His reactions were as I had
                            predicted, although the shipping interdiction scheme seemed at first to
                            make no impression on him. While I took no part in the conversations
                            during his presence, I did take advantage of the first break (on April
                            24) to suggest to Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> that the implications of this part of the proposal
                            should be carefully studied. Later in the conversations it became
                            evident that President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> had
                            given further thought to this feature, but had dismissed it as
                            unrealistic. He evidently had no confidence that the United States would
                            actually participate in an effective shipping interdiction scheme in the
                            face of strong and inevitable opposition by the British and others. In
                            his view, the proposal meant giving up Kinmen and Matsu in return for
                            another undertaking from which the United States would find reason for
                            withdrawing.</p>
                        <p>This morning (April 29), Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"
                                >Yeh</persName> gave me his opinion that it would require a great
                            deal of effort to repair the damage to Chinese confidence in the United
                            States which had resulted from the above proposals. It is evident that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> and his close
                            advisers are puzzled and disturbed. They cannot understand why following
                                <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0559"/>a course of action
                            authorized by an almost unanimous vote of the American Congress as
                            recently as January 28, should three months later threaten to “split the
                            United States wide open”. They are aware of no significant change in
                            circumstances except for a certain amount of emotion generated in the
                            American press and elsewhere, supposedly as a result of influence
                            brought to bear by fellow-travelers, Europe-firsters and the inevitable
                            British. President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            evidently interprets all of this as indicating either that the domestic
                            position of the United States Government makes it incapable of pursuing
                            a firm and consistent Far Eastern policy, or that the Administration’s
                            ultimate aim is the liquidation of the “Formosa Problem”, via
                            neutralization, trusteeship or what have you?</p>
                        <p>Before their departure, I ventured to summarize to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> what I believed to be
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>’s attitude
                            toward the current situation. I thought that as matters are developing
                            at present, President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            regarded war next year as a probability. With this in mind he would seek
                            to hang on to everything he now had and get as much more as possible, in
                            the form of United States aid, etc., in preparation for the event.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the conversations President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> made a great effort to restrain himself, in
                            deference to his visitors from Washington. He put his case frankly but
                            with fewer outward signs of emotion than I have sometimes observed in
                            talks with him when I was the only American present. However, in actual
                            fact, I have the distinct impression never before to have seen him more
                            deeply affected.</p>

                        <p>Supposing our objective is a favorable psychological impact at Peiping
                            which could eventually lead to an improvement of the specific question
                            of Formosa, and also to other features including a release of imprisoned
                            Americans, it would seem unquestionable that a direct, secret contact
                            would perhaps stimulate <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou

                        <p>We have no reason for haste in establishing the contact. Having announced
                            our willingness to talk, we are for the present in a good position. It
                            is the Chinese Communists, not ourselves, who wish to force a change in
                            the status quo. The announcement of our acceptance in principle of the
                            idea of conversations tends to keep the onus for any worsening of the
                            situation on the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>The case for proceeding deliberately is reinforced by the fact that we
                            have not yet obtained any favorable action from the Chinese Communists
                            in regard to the American prisoners. While we cannot make the release of
                            the prisoners an absolute precondition for holding the talks, we are
                            undoubtedly in a poor position to enter talks if none of our prisoners
                            has been released first. Pursuant to this line of thinking a circular

                            <item>Second stage would be one where actions by both sides would be

                                followed by US restraint on Nationalist firing on Chinese

                            to channels for bringing about US–Communist China understanding, as to
                            subject matter, and as to limits on various stages of negotiations.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he would ask <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> to talk with me, though <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> would discuss only general
                            principles and not details. I think there is possibility that <persName

                            unaware of Chinese Communist willingness to negotiate may be result of
                            an exaggerated report by <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> re <persName

                            a “listening post”. My response was that I would report our

                        <p>At one point in the conversation <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> remarked that he had great respect for the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he would likely want

                            Government greatly appreciates the Secretary’s recent statements
                            regarding <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s offer to
                            discuss the Formosan Strait’s situation with the United States. As the

                            help. <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName> had not been able
                            to see <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> as yet due to the fact

                        <p>The Secretary said that he had observed the interest taken by the United
                            Kingdom in this matter, as well as that of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Krishna Menon</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Mohammed
                                Ali</persName>. He said that we had had no direct report of

                            with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> and the Ambassador said
                            that his Government was unaware of the exact details of that talk. The
                            Secretary said that we are very anxious to produce a de facto cease fire
                            in the area, perhaps without a formal agreement. A détente at this time
                            might change the situation and it is in our interest to play for time.
                            The suggested talks might help cool off the situation.</p>

                            me to advise President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>
                            that “we understand his position” with reference to the defense of the

                                >Stump</persName> would shortly be conferring with him on the
                            subject, and that he would continue to enjoy strong United States
                            support, I immediately called on the Foreign Minister. He telephoned to
                            me half an hour later that President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> would receive me at 5 p.m. today. The Foreign
                            Minister suggested that, if I felt that I could do so, my opinion
                            expressed to him last Friday that there had <pb n="540" xml:id="pg_540"
                                facs="0568"/>been no fundamental change in the situation might be
                            repeated to President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I arrived at Shihlin at 5 p.m. and, after a few pleasantries, remarked to
                            the President that in my opinion the recent <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>-<persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            visit had produced no fundamental change in the situation as it had
                            existed since the Korean Armistice in 1953. Prior to that date Chinese
                            Communist strength had been very largely tied down in Korea.
                            Subsequently they had been able to redeploy their forces and to build up
                            the military strength in Fukien and Chekiang which now threatened the
                            offshore islands and Taiwan. Meanwhile, the military strength of Free
                            China had been increasing also. No one could be entirely sure of
                            Communist intentions, except that they were always bad. It seemed to me
                            that if a Red attack developed it would be either a probing operation
                            primarily for psychological effect against some small island or islands,
                            which the Nationalist forces could handle without our help, or it would
                            be a major offensive involving not only the offshore islands but other
                            areas as well. In the latter event, both of our governments would have
                            to consider the whole picture anew in the light of actual developments.
                            The defense of this or that minor island would be only incidental to the
                            general situation and would fall into proper perspective.</p>
                        <p>Pursuing my argument, I said that since the shelling of Kinmen last
                            September 3, I had many times expressed the opinion that there probably
                            would be no major Communist assault in the near future. Much was being
                            said about the five airfields under construction opposite Taiwan. I
                            understood that they would not all be operational for several months,
                            and that when completed would not provide for more than about 50 MIG–15s
                            each. By that time the Nationalist Air Force would have more aircraft
                            also, and the situation would not be so one-sided. I did not suppose
                            that the Reds would be fully prepared for a major operation before
                            fall—possibly in October—and very likely not until some time next
                            year.</p>
                        <p>In brief, I considered that there had been no fundamental change and that
                            the actual military situation was not unfavorable to Free China.</p>
                        <p>I then conveyed the substance of the Secretary’s telegram 662 to the
                            President. He asked whether the telegram meant that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> would actually commit United
                            States forces to help in the defense of Kinmen and Matsu. I said that I
                            thought not, but suggested if my previous analysis was correct, this
                            might not make much practical difference. President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> emphasized the effect on morale,
                            and I remarked that President <persName corresp="#p_EDD1"
                                >Eisenhower</persName> also had a “morale” problem in the form of a
                            difficult domestic political situation. By request, I then dictated to
                            Sampson Shen a paraphrase of the Secretary’s telegram.</p>
                        <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0569"/>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> next reverted to
                            the thesis that the Communists would try to destroy his Air Force and
                            Navy by attrition. Once the Reds had assumed local command of the air,
                            the protection of the offshore islands would cause excessive losses to
                            the Nationalist Air Force and Navy. Moreover, the Communists undoubtedly
                            would attack air and naval bases on Taiwan in this connection.</p>
                        <p>In reply I repeated my belief that the military situation was by no means
                            so one-sided, and that any air attacks on Taiwan presumably would be
                            carried out by bombers based in the Shanghai area rather than by MIG–15s
                            from the nearby fields in Fukien. It seemed to me that such a
                            development would open the question of our treaty obligation to defend
                            Taiwan.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the statement in the Secretary’s telegram regarding the
                            early visit of Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>,
                            President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> asked what this
                            signified. I remarked that specific reference was made to the defense of
                            the offshore islands. There were various measures which might be taken.
                            I said that I was no military expert, but that an admiral had given me
                            his opinion that the defensive strength of Kinmen could be doubled by
                            the systematic use of beach obstacles. Steel was said to be lacking for
                            this purpose. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>
                            might be able to help in this and other problems.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I repeated once more that I could not predict Communist
                            courses of action with certainty. I had no crystal ball. But I thought
                            we should not jump to the conclusion that the current Red build-up in
                            Fukien was directed solely against Taiwan. It seemed to me that the five
                            airfields were being constructed as part of a general plan to gain
                            control of the air along the China Coast. This could serve various
                            purposes, including the support of a supply line for new adventures in
                            Southeast Asia now that the port of Haiphong was passing into Communist
                            hands. The Reds knew that an attack on Taiwan would bring them into
                            conflict with the United States. But if incidentally to the general
                            development of their military strength in this area they could use it as
                            a threat, thereby obtaining possession of Kinmen and Matsu with little
                            or no actual fighting, they could be expected to do so.</p>
                        <p>President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> indicated
                            agreement with much that I had said as to Communist intentions.</p>
                        <p>The President said that he would reserve comment on the Secretary’s
                            message until he could discuss matters with Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>. He hoped that the Admiral would
                            come to Taipei as soon as possible.</p>

                                    meeting was recorded in a brief memorandum by <persName
                                        corresp="#p_GCAJ1">Goodpaster</persName>, dated May 3, which
                                    reads in part as follows:</p>
                                <p>“The principal points of policy significance were:</p>
                                <p>“1. <persName>Chiang</persName> did not wish to accept the
                                    proposition of withdrawing from the offshore islands
                                    concurrently with the imposition of some kind of interdiction of
                                    the Formosa Strait <gloss target="#t_SEA1">sea</gloss> area.</p>
                                <p>“2. <persName>Chiang</persName> did not consider it advisable
                                    that a force of U.S. Marines be stationed on Formosa.</p>
                                <p>“3. He did, however, appear reconciled to accepting that the
                                    offshore islands, if they were to be defended, would be defended
                                    by his forces alone.</p>
                                <p>“4. As a next step, at the President’s direction, Admiral
                                        <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName> should visit
                                    Formosa and advise <persName>Chiang</persName> as to ways in
                                    which defense preparations in the offshore islands can be
                                    improved.</p>
                                <p>“5. Concurrently the State Department will communicate through
                                    our Ambassadors the President’s assurances of our willingness to
                                    provide logistic support for the build-up of the offshore island
                                    defense.” (<persName corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>

                            strategy. His feeling is that perhaps their defense could be equally
                            effective with fewer men if their defenses were properly laid out and
                            constructed. I told him that in opinion of Army officers on the spot the
                            number of troops was not excessive and also that I felt you were in fact
                            giving <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss>s advice and assistance
                            in connection with improving island defense plans. State has sent msg to

                        <p>President wishes us supply what is needed. He mentioned for instance a
                            recent graduate of Ft. Benning going over basic design of defense works,
                            increasing automatic weapons and underwater obstacles, laying
                            antipersonnel mine field on beaches, increasing barbed <pb n="543"
                                xml:id="pg_543" facs="0571"/>wire defenses etc etc. The President
                            also called attention to fact that our plans to station US aircraft on
                            Formosa would release <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> aircraft
                            for better defense of offshore islands.</p>
                        <p>I feel that you are doing approximately this but if there are needs that
                            have not been met assume you will request. For instance George Anderson
                            reports that <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> commander on
                            Quemoy in answer to question as to why had not expanded underground
                            facilities in hill stated he lacked hard rock drills. These certainly
                            could be supplied quickly.</p>
                        <p>President’s basic theory is that <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >ChiNat</gloss>s prepare put up determined defense in order make
                            capture exceedingly costly but avoid implication of a Dien Bien Phu by
                            perhaps withdrawing if necessary at time of own choosing. I pointed out
                            that in my opinion feasibility of such withdrawal would depend on
                            capabilities <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">ChiNat</gloss> Air Force and
                            Navy at that time and cannot be predicted with accuracy.</p>
                        <p>With reference to conference with Gimo President feels that for morale
                            purposes the sooner you go out the better.</p>

                            to Stockholm would be a “climax” in his effort to secure release of the

                                Ambassador in Stockholm on April 23 at which he intended to make a
                                “much sharper démarche” than he could do in writing and that “he
                                wished his trip to Stockholm to create in Chinese Communist minds
                                impression of kind of climax.” (Department of State, Central Files,
                                611.95A241/4–1455)</note> I asked him whether he thought there had
                            been such climax.</p>
                        <pb n="544" xml:id="pg_544" facs="0572"/>
                        <p>He said he felt his trip to Stockholm had brought the whole matter closer
                            to the “ultimatum stage”, that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> had clearly indicated he had made up his mind in
                            January to settle the question, but had laid the delay to US
                            over-flights in connection with the Tachen evacuation and the incident
                            of the plane to Bandung. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had
                            done this with both himself, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>, and <persName corresp="#p_WWPKNB1">Prince
                                Wan</persName> and had gone even farther with <persName
                                corresp="#p_WWPKNB1">Wan</persName> and said his intention had not
                            changed.</p>
                        <p>At present, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had not replied to
                            two sets of communications, which <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> felt he must reply to. The first were the
                            letters from the families of the fliers, and the second was the question
                            which <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> asked the
                            Chinese Communist Ambassador in Stockholm: “Is there anything that I
                            (Hammarskjold) can do to facilitate the release of the prisoners”?
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> emphasized this
                            question was based on the fact the Chinese Communist Ambassador was
                            talking about “how” and not “whether” the fliers should be released. He
                            felt it was clear to the Ambassador that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>’s question was based on the assumption that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> intended to release the
                            fliers.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my questions, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> said he had made it clear that the Chinese
                            Communists understood that they were expected to provide a reply in
                            writing to his question. He felt <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> could not reply by a simple yes or no. He now
                            either had to say he was going to release the fliers or say how
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> could help him do
                            so. If <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> should not answer,
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>, as a result of
                            his Stockholm talks, could increase the pressure and demand to know why
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had not gone ahead and
                            released them, since he had not replied. He said that he felt there was
                            a 99 percent probability of the Chinese Communists’ intention to release
                            the fliers.</p>
                        <p>I said that an intention to release was all well and good, but the
                            question of time was very vital, that maybe it was true that in China
                            time was not a factor, but in this country, time was a factor and we
                            could not wait forever. I therefore asked him what further steps he
                            contemplated.</p>
                        <p>He said that a report to the <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss> was a
                            “must”. I dwelt on this and said: “you mean you definitely intend to
                            file a report which will lay it on the line”? He said emphatically: “of
                            course, of course”. He would intend to do it “in due time” before the
                                <gloss target="#t_GA1">GA</gloss>, although, he said, “maybe the
                            report will be much earlier”.</p>
                        <p>He feels his trip to Stockholm has brought the whole thing much closer.
                            He said if there was no reply before he went to Europe, which is May 21,
                            he would then send a message to <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName> by the Swedish Ambassador in Peiping. “I will tell
                            him that I must make a report”, <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> said, “if there is no answer by June 1,
                            then I will feel constrained to report that it has been a failure”.</p>
                        <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0573"/>
                        <p>In reply to my question, he said he had no objection to our mentioning
                            the fliers at the same time we negotiated for release of civilian
                            prisoners, but cautioned that we should make it clear that the fliers
                            were in a different category than the civilians and that the fliers were
                            military <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s.</p>
                        <p>When I asked him how he felt about using intermediaries such as India or
                            Pakistan to bring moral pressure to bear on the Chinese Communists, he
                            said, “not on the fliers just now. I have as much chance as the US has
                            to get India or Burma or Thailand into play and I have had no response
                            at all from India or Burma to my request. After this next phase is over,
                            it may be opportune”.</p>
                        <p>I said that we were drawing near to the end of our rope here in the US
                            and the situation could become ugly. I pointed out that for a people
                            that was as intense as the American people, we had shown great
                            self-control from the beginning of this whole episode. I pointed out
                            that men of very different political viewpoints had now joined in active
                            condemnation of the retention of the fliers.</p>
                        <p>He said he was well aware of this. He recalled that on his return from
                            Peking in January I had said that what he wanted me to do was to prevent
                            politicians from acting like politicians and newspapermen from acting
                            like newspapermen.<note n="4" xml:id="d238fn4">On January 13; see <ref
                                    target="#d11">Document 11</ref>.</note> He thought that a lot
                            had been achieved and that both politicians and the press had shown
                            great forebearance. He gave every impression of being determined not to
                            let all of his efforts go to waste and not to let the matter peter out.
                            I believe that he intends, if his efforts fail, to say so in a candid
                            manner.</p>

                            request. He said he wished to make two inquiries: (1) as to U.S.
                            intentions concerning talks with the Chinese Communists; and (2) the
                            inclusion of Far Eastern items on the agenda of the forthcoming Paris
                                meetings.<note n="2" xml:id="d239fn2">Reference is to the

                                9–11; see <ref target="#d246">Document 246</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>As to (1), the Ambassador said he realized that public opinion in general
                            had made necessary some U.S. statement in response to the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> declaration at Bandung that
                            he was prepared to negotiate with the United States for easing of
                            tensions. He said that his Government would like to know if the U.S.
                            Government contemplated entering into direct bilateral talks with the
                            Chinese Communists, or proceeding through a third party?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the U.S. Government had been seeking a cease-fire
                            arrangement for some time. He was aware that the Chinese Government had
                            a somewhat different view of the problem. The views of the two
                            Governments were not fully in accord on the question of the desirability
                            of a cease-fire in the area. The New Zealand initiative in the Security
                            Council had not been followed up because the Chinese Communists had
                            refused to appear. The President, in his message to Congress on the
                            Joint Resolution on the defense of Taiwan, had said that he hoped a
                            situation of stability could eventually be created in the area so that
                            it would not be necessary to fight. If we could get a commitment from
                            the Chinese Communists not to use force, naturally we would be glad to
                            receive it. There is no present program for following up the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> offer. Several foreign
                            government representatives on their own initiative are trying to find

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said he had heard
                            of efforts by the British, the Pakistani, the Indians, and the
                            Indonesians to follow up the <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> initiative. He asked if he was correct in
                            understanding that there had been no action by the United States
                            Government in response to the <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> statement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that this was correct. He referred to the President’s
                            statement that we should “wait and see”.<note n="3" xml:id="d239fn3">At

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he assumed that
                            the Ambassador had read the Secretary’s remarks at his press conference
                            of April 26.</p>
                        <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0575"/>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was surprised that the press had construed his
                            remarks as being in conflict with the Department’s press release of
                            April 23. The Secretary said there was nothing in his statement which
                            was in conflict with the Departmental release. The Secretary felt that
                            the press interpretation of his reaction was misleading. He had not
                            contradicted the Departmental statement concerning the necessary role of
                            the Chinese Government in any discussions where its interests were
                            involved. On the contrary, he had confirmed this. His statement had
                            emphasized that we were concerned with ascertaining if there was any
                            good faith in <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s offer,
                            and he had tried to make it clear that the items mentioned in the
                            Departmental statement were not preconditions for talks. We are still
                            seeking a cease-fire. If the Communists agree to a cease-fire, naturally
                            we will be very happy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said he was
                            pleased to hear this explanation. He observed that a cease-fire
                            agreement is usually considered to require more than one party. He did
                            not understand precisely how a cease-fire agreement could be achieved
                            when there would be only one contesting party involved in the talks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that the Ambassador’s point was well taken. The term
                            “cease-fire agreement” was loosely used. What we wanted was a Chinese
                            Communist assurance that they would not attack Taiwan and Penghu, Quemoy
                            or Matsu. We would be glad to have such an assurance.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said it was clear
                            that his Government would not be a party to any cease-fire talks or
                            arrangements with the Chinese Communists. His Government was the other
                            party in the hostilities, not the United States. He asked how the United
                            States could participate in cease-fire talks when it was not engaged in
                            hostilities?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that what the United States wants in effect is a
                            unilateral renunciation of the use of force by the Chinese Communists.
                            He doubted if we would get it. He thought that a situation of de facto
                            cease-fire might be achieved. The Chinese Communists might refrain from
                            a major assault. But he did not expect to get any signed document
                            embodying a cease-fire pledge from the Chinese Communists. He said that
                            we have no present plans to take any initiative as to talks with the
                            Chinese Communists. We have not authorized any representative of any
                            other Government to act in our behalf. He stated that the United States
                            Government did not know in advance of <persName corresp="#p_TH1"

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if he could
                            take it that the United States has not asked any one to act as an
                            intermediary in this matter?</p>
                        <pb n="548" xml:id="pg_548" facs="0576"/>
                        <p>The Secretary confirmed that this understanding was correct.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> observed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> after his first
                            statement appeared to have retracted part of it. He had made a
                            differentiation between discussions on the easing of tensions, and the
                            “liberation” of Taiwan. He appeared not to have given any ground on the
                            latter, stressing that it was a domestic issue and not subject to any
                            outside interference.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary mentioned that he had noted this matter in the course of
                            his press conference.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> asked if the
                            Department had received any reports from representatives of other
                            Governments which might throw light on the <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-lai</persName> offer.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary read from a confidential report of a representative of a
                            friendly Government who took part in private conversations with
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> at Bandung. The
                            extract read by the Secretary quoted <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> as having said that negotiations must lead to the
                            “liberation” of Taiwan. If the negotiations went forward peacefully,
                            there would be no war. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            was further quoted as saying the Chinese Communists would not be
                            intimidated. The report attributed to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> a statement that the Chinese Communists in

                                statement summarized here by asking if <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                    >Chou</persName> envisaged, as a result of the proposed

                                    <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> replied that that
                                would certainly be the Chinese proposal and that the United States
                                would doubtless have a counter-proposal. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                    >Chou</persName> objected to the Department of State press
                                release of April 23, declaring that the Department was laying down
                                conditions for negotiations—the presence of
                                    <persName>Chiang</persName> at the negotiations and the
                                acceptance of a cease-fire—which his Government could never accept,
                                because Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan was involved and because the
                                quarrel with <persName>Chiang</persName> was an internal matter.
                                    <persName>Malik</persName> told him that the U.S. Government was
                                complex and required time to reach a final decision; he urged
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> not to regard any

                            second topic, asking if the Secretary planned to discuss China issues in
                            Paris the following week?</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that at the <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss>
                            Council there would be a general report on the world situation. The
                            general statement would include something on the Far East. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> was going to Paris <pb
                                n="549" xml:id="pg_549" facs="0577"/>because Indochina matters,
                            especially the Viet Nam problem, would be taken up.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            Taiwan was not on the agenda. But he anticipated that foreign government
                            representatives would ask about developments in the Taiwan area, just as
                            so many Ambassadors in Washington do.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that all
                            sorts of speculations regarding Taiwan were current. His Government was
                            glad that U.S. officials had not contributed to the speculation. He said
                            his Government took it that there was no intention on the part of the
                            U.S. Government to alter its China recognition policy.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary confirmed that this was correct.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he was
                            going to Paris solely to discuss Indochina matters.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he felt that with both <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> and Pinay<note n="6" xml:id="d239fn6">French
                                Foreign Minister Antoine Pinay.</note> present, and with Britain and
                            France both interested in Taiwan questions, discussions related to China
                            would be difficult to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that China
                            matters were not on the agenda.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary reminded the Ambassador that the Chinese Government had
                            explicit assurances that no negotiations involving the essential
                            interests of the Chinese Government would take place without that
                            Government’s participation. The Secretary said he did not wonder that
                            the Chinese Government was occasionally somewhat anxious. Many meetings
                            and conversations necessarily take place without the presence of Chinese
                            representatives. The Secretary told the Ambassador that the U.S.
                            Government intends to work with the Chinese Government and when there is
                            anything of a concrete nature to discuss, it will be taken up with the
                            Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said his Government was always ready for consultations
                            under Article IV of the Mutual Defense Treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that there had already been two such consultations
                            under the treaty: The first when he was in Formosa in early March and
                            the second when Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> made a special

                            document is the result of combined planning by the United States forces,
                            representing the Commander in Chief, Pacific (<gloss
                                target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss>) and headed by Vice Admiral
                            Arthur M. Pride, Commander, U.S. 7th Fleet, with representatives of the
                            Ministry of National Defense, of the Republic of China. Conferences
                            resulting in plan “Rochester” were held in Taipei from March 15 through
                            28, 1955 and were based on a verbal agreement between the Chief of Naval
                            Operations, United States Department of Defense and the Minister of
                            National Defense of the Republic of China. Conferences were held on the
                            military level without participation by an Embassy representative.</p>
                        <p>The plan, as agreed upon between the U.S. and Chinese military
                            representatives provides for the combined operations of U.S. and Chinese
                            forces in the event of hostilities in the Taiwan area in which both
                            forces are engaged. It defines the basic responsibilities under combat
                            and combat-planning conditions, of the various elements of the U.S. and
                            Chinese forces which it is contemplated will be deployed in the defense
                            of Taiwan, Penghu and, possibly, the off-shore islands. What it does <hi

                                >MND</gloss> desires in the matter and extensive press speculation
                            throughout the course of the conference, is to establish a combined
                            staff or combined command intermingling Chinese and U.S. officers in
                            staff and command positions in a single headquarters.</p>
                        <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0579"/>
                        <p>In summary, the plan contains a general estimate of the military
                            situation, including enemy capabilities and Chinese-U.S. potential, a
                            listing of U.S. forces which it is expected will be deployed in the
                            event of hostilities, and an outline plan of how the U.S. and Chinese
                            forces will coordinate their individual planning so that an efficient
                            combined combat operation might be possible. Operational
                            responsibilities are allocated, the Chinese assuming the burden of
                            ground activity and the United States the major task of air defense and
                            naval support and bombardment. Understandings appear to have been
                            reached that Chinese Naval and Air Forces shall be employed under U.S.
                            operational control in the event of a combined effort.</p>
                        <p>The operations plan stresses coordinated action by the two forces, a
                            maximum of control by the “parent” country and a return of integrated
                            Chinese air and naval forces to such control whenever combat conditions
                            permit. The U.S. forces have, in the conference leading to plan
                            “Rochester”, given assurances to the Chinese Government that the U.S.
                            accepts primary responsibility for air defense, naval surface action and
                            offensive air action in the Taiwan area in the event that U.S. forces
                            are ordered engaged. During pre-hostilities operations, unilateral but
                            closely coordinated operations are stressed, with a view towards a
                            smooth transition into operations on a combined basis when and if
                            required.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s attention is invited to Appendix 1 to Annex I of the
                            enclosed plan (see tab)<note n="4" xml:id="d240fn4">Not printed.</note>
                            which the Department will recognize as the draft military agreement
                            which <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> prepared earlier this year
                            and which it proposed be signed with the Ministry of National Defense on
                            a military level. A copy of this draft agreement and the Embassy’s
                            comments thereon were forwarded to the Department in the despatch in
                            reference. When execution of this agreement was delayed due to lack of
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1">CINCPAC</gloss> approval, it was
                            apparently decided to include it as a part of plan “Rochester” in the
                            hope that, viewed in connection with an operation plan of a scope which
                            would require some type of base rights agreement for its effectuation,
                            the draft agreement would receive immediate approval. However, the
                            opposite result may have obtained, for <gloss target="#t_CINCPAC1"

                            National Defense was apparently quite confident that the draft agreement
                            would receive instant approval from the higher headquarters (US), as it
                            scheduled a signing ceremony which, after receipt of <gloss

                                <p>“The conference was apparently successful, not because it solved
                                    the myriad of problems involved in planning and executing
                                    combined wartime operations, but because it demonstrated
                                    willingness on the part of the U.S. to bring the problems into
                                    the open, and to take positive steps toward their solution.
                                    Arrangements were made for coordinated US-Chinese planning and
                                    action, some of which to the lay observer, seem so basic that he
                                    might be inclined to question why such arrangements were only
                                    now being settled. The answer undoubtedly is that until the U.S.
                                    and the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> individually had
                                    reached the present stage of planning, staffing and preparation,
                                    the details of a combined effort could not rationally have been

                                    agreement with the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> made its

                                    fact that the U.S. planners had no firm base rights arrangements
                                    with the Chinese. The U.S. representatives felt they had nothing
                                    on which they could rely for a definition of their rights,
                                    privileges and immunities in general and as a basic
                                    understanding with the Chinese on such matters as acquisition
                                    of, title to and disposition of property and improvements
                                    acquired with U.S. funds. Although, as the Department is well
                                    aware, U.S. forces brought into Taiwan under Article 7 of the
                                    Mutual Defense Treaty of December 2, 1954, have been accorded

                                    requesting the replacement of this arrangement by a status of

                                    some permanent understanding can be reached on this question it
                                    seems doubtful that U.S. plans for the defense of Taiwan can be

                                            >footnote 2 above</ref>. The conversation was reported
                                        in telegram 2113 from Jakarta, May 2. (Department of State,
                                        Central Files, 793.00/5–255) In the paragraph under
                                        reference, the two Prime Ministers expressed sympathy and
                                        support “for the efforts of either of the two countries in
                                        safeguarding its own sovereignty and territorial
                                        integrity.”</note> He expressed embarrassment that his
                                    Government had failed to spell out that its intention was
                                    limited to peaceful efforts but added he felt that everyone in
                                    the world realized that Indonesia itself had only peaceful
                                    intentions. The Secretary expressed appreciation for the
                                    clarification.</p>

                                    and what information is available. He added that we are not
                                    making up our minds just now but we would appreciate being
                                    informed by Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AM1"

                                    ask anyone to act as intermediary. We are anxious to have
                                    information which may be acquired on the initiative of other
                                    countries. We will gather the information as we can and then
                                    decide on the next step. He opined that possibly some further
                                    initiative will come from the Chinese Peoples Republic
                                    itself.</p></item>

                            he was by no means convinced of <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s sincerity. Several countries, the <gloss

                            proffered their good offices to the U.S. to facilitate a peaceful
                            solution in the Far East. Meanwhile, the Department was gathering
                            information by “probing”. At an appropriate time it could contact the
                            Communist Chinese through the Embassy of a friendly country such as one
                            of those just mentioned, or it could utilize the intermediary of the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. Did Ambassador
                                <persName>Malik</persName> have any thoughts on this subject?</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Malik</persName> agreed that the intentions of the
                            Communist Chinese should be probed with the expectation that there would
                            have to be an eventual face-to-face meeting. The Secretary replied that
                            in his view a face-to-face meeting should not come soon, but be preceded
                            by exchanges of messages through intermediaries and further probing as
                            to intentions. Ambassador <persName>Malik</persName> agreed. He could
                            hardly advise as to whom to use as intermediary. The <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> was hardly an intermediary who would
                            satisfy the requirement of being one in whom both parties could have
                            confidence.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether <persName>Malik</persName> had any idea as to
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s thoughts on the
                            mechanics of negotiation. <persName>Malik</persName> replied in the
                            negative, but had the strong impression that <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>’s idea was to meet around the table somewhere,
                            sometime. The Secretary indicated that <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557"
                                facs="0585"/>while the four previously mentioned countries (the

                            were acting voluntarily in probing the intentions of the Communist

                        <p><persName>Malik</persName> asked whether the Secretary General of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> might be a suitable intermediary.
                            Had he done a good job in connection with the American flyers? The
                            Secretary replied that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> had not done a good job.
                                <persName>Malik</persName> asked about <persName corresp="#p_AM1"
                                >Mohammed Ali</persName>. The Secretary responded that so many
                            countries which might be intermediaries have interests of their own,
                            which they would wish to see served. There was the friction between
                            Pakistan and India and the fact that Pakistan would like to neutralize
                            China as far as India is concerned. The Secretary had merely wished to
                            be sure before going to Paris that he had all
                            <persName>Malik</persName>’s thoughts, since the topic would come up at
                            Paris and if he then went on to Vienna, <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> might bring it up there.
                                <persName>Malik</persName> replied that if he personally could
                            assist in any way, he would be glad to ask his Government for permission
                            to proceed to Communist China. The Secretary expressed his appreciation
                            for this offer without accepting it.</p>

                        <p>Transcript Secretary’s April 26 Press Conference which transmitted in
                            wireless bulletin gives general lines our present thinking. Our
                            objectives in probing Communist intentions will be to assess prospects
                            for achieving a lasting cease-fire and general acceptance of necessity
                            for peaceful solution to Taiwan problem.</p>
                        <p>Regarding <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>’s comments on
                            difficulties public agreement to cease-fire we agree that initially this
                            may not be possible but at some time this and other negotiated points
                            would have to be made public somehow. We believe there is no need to
                            concern ourselves unduly with this problem now, however, and we should
                            seek initially only to find out whether realistic basis for cease-fire
                            exists.</p>
                        <p>Regarding imprisoned American airmen we appreciate action taken by <gloss

                        <p>I remarked to Foreign Minister that to obtain de facto cease-fire along
                            above lines it presumably necessary US ask <gloss target="#t_GRC1"
                                >GRC</gloss> suspend its “port closure” as applied to portion of
                            China coast since 1949. Latter not particularly effective in any case
                            due limitations of <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> Navy, to British
                            action which encourages Chinese-owned Hong Kong ships in breaking port
                            closure and to US reluctance extend avowed support, even moral, to
                                <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> in this connection. Suspension
                            of port closure for duration of cease-fire therefore would involve
                            yielding no important present advantages but should please British and
                            provide face-saving device for Reds if they were ready for any reason to
                            stop shooting at least temporarily. Perhaps more important, <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> willingness suspend port closure should
                            remove, for many of our friends, what doubtless appears as major
                            objection to <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> retention of Kinmen and
                            Matsu. There are numerous similar “offshore islands” situations but
                            where they do not serve as bases for active interference with nearby
                            territory there is no urgent case for transfer of sovereignty.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> pointed out that since UNO
                            imposed embargo on Red China, port closure had been in effect <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss>’s contribution to its enforcement,
                            although not at UNO request. I observed it not generally so regarded and

                            not affect UNO embargo.</p>
                        <p>I doubt Chinese Communists would go along in good faith with above scheme
                            or any other practicable cease-fire proposal, but such approach might

                        <p>The situation in the Far East, especially with regard to Taiwan and the
                            offshore islands, was a subject of discussion at the May 10 sessions of
                            the North Atlantic Council, during the ministerial meeting of the
                            Council in Paris, May 9–11, 1955. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> gave an exposition of United States policy,
                            stating that the United States was not committed to defend Quemoy and
                            the Matsus unless an attack on them was part of an attack on Formosa and
                            the Pescadores but noting that the Chinese Communists had never made any
                            distinction between the offshore islands and Formosa. He expressed the
                            hope that a situation would develop in which both the Communists and the
                            Nationalists continued to assert their claims but neither side tried to
                            pursue them through the use of force.</p>
                        <p>During the subsequent discussion, Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri
                            Spaak asserted that opinion in Europe differed from that in the United
                            States on two points: 1) Europeans saw a great difference between the
                            defense of Formosa, the juridical status of which was at least
                            debatable, and the defense of Quemoy and Matsu, which were clearly
                            Chinese; and 2) they differed with the United States view of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>, considering that his
                            role in Asia was over and that his statements were frequently dangerous.
                            Spaak suggested that recognition of the People’s Republic of China was
                            inevitable. It would be necessary to deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> to resolve the Formosa
                            question, just as it had been necessary to deal with him to make peace
                            in Korea and Indochina.</p>
                        <p>In reply, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again noted that
                            the Communists did not accept any distinction between Formosa and the
                            offshore islands and declared that, in case of an attack on the offshore
                            islands, the decision as to whether the attack was directed against
                            Formosa would be made by the President. He defended <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> as a man of personal
                            integrity, sincere anti-communism, and loyalty to his friends and
                            commitments. He also pointed out that <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> had made a formal agreement not to attack the
                            mainland except in the case of imminent necessity of self-defense or in
                            agreement with the United States. Records of the discussion (<gloss

                            444. The discussion was summarized in Poltos 2279 and 2282 from Paris,
                            May 11 and 12, 1955. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, Central Files,

                        <p>In his report to the National Security Council on May 19 concerning the
                            Paris meetings, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>
                            stated, according to <persName corresp="#p_GSE1">Gleason</persName>’s
                            memorandum of the discussion, that “he had had a quite lively
                            conversation with Spaak, the Belgian Foreign Minister, on the <pb
                                n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0589"/>subject of U.S. policy in the
                            Far East, of which M. Spaak had inclined to be critical.</p>
                        <p>“The President inquired in what respects Spaak had been critical of our
                            policy in this area. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> replied that Spaak did not hold a high opinion of
                                <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. In response
                            to this point of Spaak’s, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> asked the Foreign Ministers if they thought
                            highly of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he then went on
                            to defend <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> as a
                            stalwart <persName corresp="#p_HCA1">Christian</persName>, a man of
                            personal probity, and a statesman who had been consistently loyal to the
                            engagements and commitments he had made to the United States. While
                            there were, of course, many European statesmen who were thus loyal, they
                            were relatively few in Asia. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                >Dulles</persName> commented that this exchange had been productive
                            of healthy results.” (Memorandum of discussion by <persName

                                >Chiang</persName> brought up important question involving policy.

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> expressed appreciation
                                <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>’s assurances of
                            continued US support and high priority to be given Free China’s <gloss
                                target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss> requirements. Then he referred to
                            recent US refusal concur in bombing by <gloss target="#t_CAF1"
                                >CAF</gloss> of new Communist airfields under construction in
                            Fukien. Said he would comply with US wishes for time being but when
                            enemy airfields become operational it would be within inherent right of
                            self-defense to attack them.</p>
                        <p>I referred to importance of not striking first blow as emphasized during
                            recent <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>-<persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> visit, unpleasant as it might
                            be to wait for enemy to attack. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1"
                                >Stump</persName> pointed out that appearance of MIGs on nearby
                            Communist airfields did not necessarily imply hostile intent; they might
                            be intended for defense. While desirable militarily to bomb airfields
                            before enemy struck, he said, there could be offsetting political
                            considerations.</p>
                        <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0590"/>
                        <p>President said he would consider concentration of fighters on these
                            fields sufficient evidence of hostile intent. I observed matter was
                            complex and must be considered carefully from every angle. From purely
                            military standpoint, prospective accomplishments of Chinese Air Force
                            fighter-bombers must be weighed against probable losses.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> said he would
                            do nothing “provocative”.</p>

                            Troyanovsky acted as interpreter. The Secretary said he wanted to talk
                            about that matter seriously. He asked whether Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> remembered the conversation the
                            two of them had had alone at Berlin<note n="2" xml:id="d249fn2">On
                                February 13, 1954, at the Berlin Conference.</note> when the
                            Secretary had said that he saw danger signs and that events of the Far
                            East might develop grave results which none of us wanted. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he did remember. The
                            Secretary said we were very close to that danger point now. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said it would take time to work
                            out. The Secretary replied that it would also take patience and
                            restraint.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> what
                            suggestions he had for settling the Formosa question on a peaceful
                            basis. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied that he
                            had already suggested that the question be discussed in a five-power
                            conference. The Secretary answered that it could be better discussed in
                            a six-power conference. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            replied that the Chinese Communists would not agree. (Apparently
                            referring to being unwilling to sit down with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>.) The Secretary
                            countered by saying in no event would we discuss the interests of the
                            Chinese Nationalists without their participation. Just as the Soviets
                            might feel it necessary to be loyal to the GDR, we would be completely
                            loyal to the Government of the Republic of China. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> nodded his head. He then said
                            “if a conference of five is too small, we could have one of ten.”
                            (Presumably he was referring to a ten-power conference which had at one
                            time been suggested in other quarters.)<note n="3" xml:id="d249fn3"
                                >Reference is apparently to the Soviet proposal for a 10-power
                                conference, made to the British on February 4; see <ref
                                    target="#d86fn2">footnote 2, Document 86</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said “we want peace” and
                            asked along what lines did we expect his suggestions to be made. The
                            Secretary replied that in Korea, Germany, Viet Nam we believed in
                            achieving unification by peaceful means and not by violence. So too in
                            Formosa, without <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0592"/>prejudice to
                            conflicting claims, the parties should renounce force and attempt a
                            peaceful solution.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary continued that in so far as Formosa was concerned, there
                            need be no great hurry. It has been 60 years since China had held
                            Formosa and the fact that Formosa was not still Japanese was wholly due
                            to the fact that the US had had the power to take Formosa away from
                            Japan. Indeed the control of China over Formosa before the Treaty of
                                1895<note n="4" xml:id="d249fn4">Text of the Sino-Japanese Treaty
                                signed at Shimonoseki on April 17, 1895, is in <ref

                            tenuous for centuries. Surely the situation could continue another
                            decade or longer if the alternative was the risk of war within a
                            year.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> then said “But Quemoy and
                            Matsu don’t belong to Formosa.” The Secretary said that they were now in
                            the possession of what we recognized as the lawful government of
                            China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that they had
                            been held indefinitely by the Republic of China except for the brief
                            wartime occupation by Japan. The Communists had made one effort several
                            years ago to take Quemoy and had been bloodily repulsed. Apart from that
                            their lawful possession by the Government of China had never been
                            challenged.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that what he was talking about was Formosa and not
                            Quemoy and Matsu. He reminded <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> that our Treaty with the ROC only covered
                            Formosa and the Pescadores and that our interest in the islands arose
                            from their relation to the defense of the Treaty area. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> nodded his head. The Chinese
                            Communists had themselves refused to make any distinction between
                            Formosa and the offshore islands. In all their statements they declare
                            that their purpose is to liberate Formosa and that the capture of the
                            offshore islands will facilitate this object.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then referred to the Communist build-up of airfields on the
                            Mainland opposite Formosa. Ostensibly they were for attack on Formosa.
                            The US had used its influence with the Chinese Nationalists to restrain
                            them from attacking these positions. It was difficult to keep this
                            situation from breaking out into war. The Secretary went on to say that
                            the Chinese Communists were dependent upon Russia for various strategic
                            supplies and planes and could not develop their plans without Russian
                            support. The Secretary said that we had obtained from the Chinese
                            Nationalists arrangements which we thought would enable us to influence
                            the situation for peace from our side and he suggested that the Soviet
                            Union could do the same with the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied that the build-up
                            of airfields was an internal affair with which he had nothing to do. The
                            Secretary said that he <pb n="565" xml:id="pg_565" facs="0593"/>hoped
                            the Soviets would exercise restraint on the Communists. At this point
                            dinner was announced. Before the subject was abandoned, the Secretary
                            asked <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> to give further
                            consideration to the problem and let us know what he thought could be
                            done towards a peaceful solution. The Secretary said that if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had any further ideas
                            he could communicate them privately either through Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_BCE1">Bohlen</persName> in Moscow or the Soviet
                            Ambassador in Washington.</p>

                                    Committee of the National People’s Congress on May 13; the text,
                                    as printed in a supplement to <hi rend="italic">People’s
                                        China</hi>, June 16, 1955, reads in part as follows:</p>
                                <p>“Taiwan is China’s territory, the people living in Taiwan are
                                    Chinese people, and the liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese
                                    people is a question of China’s domestic affair. The United
                                    States occupation of Taiwan has created tension in the Taiwan
                                    area and this constitutes an international issue between China
                                    and the United States. The two questions cannot be mixed up.
                                    There is no war between China and the U.S., so the question of a
                                    so-called cease-fire does not arise. The Chinese people are
                                    friendly with the American people. The Chinese people do not
                                    want to have a war with the United States. To ease tension in
                                    the Taiwan area, the Chinese Government is willing to sit down
                                    and enter into negotiations with the United States Government.
                                    As to the form of negotiations, the Chinese Government supports
                                    the Soviet proposal for a ten-power conference and is also
                                    willing to consider other forms. However, no negotiations should
                                    in the slightest degree affect the Chinese people’s exercise of
                                    their own sovereign rights—their just demand and action to
                                    liberate Taiwan. At the same time, the Chinese Government can at
                                    no time agree to participation by the <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> clique in any
                                    international conference. The Chinese people have two possible
                                    means to liberate Taiwan, namely by war or by peaceful means.
                                    The Chinese people are willing to strive for the liberation of
                                    Taiwan by peaceful means so far as it is
                            possible.”</p></note></p>
                        <p>This is, I think, significant. It may be a response to the statements we
                            have often made that just as in the case of divided Germany, Korea and
                            Vietnam, unification must be sought only by peaceful means and not by
                            force. It might mean an attempt to differentiate Taiwan from Quemoy and
                            Matsu so that they could attack the latter <pb n="567" xml:id="pg_567"
                                facs="0595"/>without the attack being considered directed against
                            Formosa so as to justify you in invoking the Treaty and P.L.4. However,
                            the speech did not itself mention Quemoy and the Matsus or suggest a
                            differentiation.</p>

                        <p>At a meeting of the National Security Council on May 19, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> reported on his
                            meetings in Vienna; his description of his May 14 conversation with
                            Foreign Minister <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> is
                            recorded as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Perhaps the single most interesting event at Vienna had been a
                                    dinner which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> had attended with the three other Foreign
                                    Ministers. The occasion had provided a private conversation with
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> on the
                                    situation in China. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> had indicated to <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> the United States view
                                    and line on China—namely, that China was a divided country, that
                                    there were several other divided countries in Asia such as Korea
                                    and Vietnam, and finally, that such divisions should not be the
                                    occasion for solutions reached by force. Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had then appealed to
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> to induce the
                                    Soviet Government to use its influence with Communist China to
                                    prevent Communist China from resorting to force. In the course
                                    of this he had pointed out the build-up of war potential in the
                                    areas of Communist China opposite Formosa.</p>
                                <p>“<persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>, continued
                                    Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, was
                                    interested but reserved in response to these comments. He used
                                    the familiar argument that the actions of the Chinese Communists
                                    were an internal matter in which the Soviet Government could not
                                    interfere. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> had responded to this by pointing out
                                    that, after all, the Russians were supplying the Chinese
                                    Communists with the stuff by which they were carrying on their
                                    military build-up.</p>
                                <p>“At a later point in the conversation, <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> suggested a Five-Power
                                    conference (to include Communist China) which could deal with
                                    Far Eastern problems. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> replied that he would much prefer a
                                    Six-Power conference (including the Chinese Nationalists). All
                                    in all, this had been quite a talk, although it probably
                                    produced no result other than Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>’ own statement as to the
                                    gravity of the situation in the area of the Formosa Strait.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> at least said
                                    that he would think about the points Secretary <persName
                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> had raised, a statement

                                xml:id="d253fn2">Telegram 685 to Taipei, May 18, states that a
                                British Embassy officer expressed concern to the Department at a May
                                6 announcement by the ROC Government that the territorial waters of
                                the Nationalist-held offshore islands had been mined. The Department
                                informed the British representative that this action violated no
                                treaty or other U.S. rights, but the Department thought the British
                                should be reassured that the mines were within 3 miles of the
                                Nationalist-held islands and not in normal shipping lanes and that a
                                warning would be issued if any were laid in shipping channels. It
                                requested the Embassy’s comment. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>,
                                793.5/5–1855)</note> Regarding mine fields in territorial waters
                            offshore islands, <persName corresp="#p_CMGWC1">Chase</persName> and I
                            agree most unlikely Chinese would agree to give British assurances. In
                            eyes Chinese Government ships carry supplies to Red Chinese soldiers
                            these ports, which cannot easily reach them any other way. Further, any
                            assurance to British would surely soon become known to Communist Chinese
                            thus defeating at least in part effectiveness of this measure.</p>
                        <p>As for similar action by US, decision to provide and lay these mines was
                            taken at high levels US Government, certainly as high as <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, and Defense knows precisely where mine
                            fields are. Any decision on disclosure location should certainly be
                            taken same high level. We recommend against such US action which would
                            be unilateral, contrary to Chinese wishes and involve violation of
                            Chinese confidence.</p>

                        <p>At the Bandung Conference you suggested that we should enter into

                            in the Taiwan Area. Subsequently you indicated that the Chinese people

                            Taiwan and its people, since it was above all the armed effort of the

                            end is abstention from the use of force in that area and agreement that
                            peaceful means shall be employed in the settlement of outstanding
                            differences.</p>
                        <p>For its part the United States has not resorted to the use of force, and
                            has brought about conditions under which there is no use of force
                            against the Chinese Mainland. The United States is prepared to assure
                            the continuance of these conditions and to arrange for mutually
                            agreeable negotiations, on the assumption that you on your part are also

                            arrangements to insure peace in the Area.<note n="3" xml:id="d256fn3"

                                <persName>Williams</persName>, Acting High Commissioners <gloss

                            to <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> and <persName

                        <p>They said purpose of visit was to request me inform US Government that

                            impressions; atmosphere of meetings, were so difficult to convey by
                            messages that conversations at Washington were necessary if progress was
                            to be made.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on substantive matters, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said one concrete result obtained was agreement of
                            Chinese Communists to release four US airmen of “Fischer Group”.</p>
                        <p>He said that announcement release would be made by Chinese Communists May
                            30 and he would also make statement at his press conference New Delhi
                            same day. When I asked why not all prisoners released, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> replied that he had found
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had to deal with public
                            opinion and there was much news there of US-Chinese Communist air fight

                                xml:id="pg_577" facs="0605"/>made release difficult. Further that it
                            was opening step by Chinese Communists. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said flatly he was sure all airmen would be
                            released if relatives permitted to visit them, visits being interpreted
                            by him as moderator of “public opinion”. Said he felt sure Chinese
                            Communists willing reach settlement respecting release all US nationals
                            in China. His comment on this not clear but I understand it was
                            settlement in connection Chinese nationals in US which could be
                            restatement of old Chinese Communist position.</p>
                        <p>Only other comment bearing on substance was that he felt sure there would
                            be no initiation of hostilities Formosan Straits by Chinese Communists
                            during time subject of possibility of negotiations being discussed.</p>
                        <p>He said he had talked six times <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou</persName>, averaging three hours each talk, on subject
                            negotiations. In addition, had talked once with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MT1">Mao</persName> and several times with other
                            officials on subject. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> had
                            expressed no enmity to “American people”, atmosphere of talks had been
                            good, and he was convinced Chinese Communists wanted peaceful solution
                            of issues.</p>
                        <p>At this point, <persName>Pillai</persName> made his single comment during
                            hour talk, saying it was belief of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                            that Chinese Communists wanted peaceful solutions.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> again citing importance of
                            “Chinese opinion” said it important his view that: <list>

                                <item>Release of four US airmen would not result in US “hard”

                                    Said this very important and he hoped US Government would
                                    exercise restraining attitude. Also urged strongly that US
                                    statements and action on whole subject of negotiations be
                                    moderate.</item>

                                <item>Without elaboration suggested that a method of negotiations
                                    had been opened in his talks. On this point said “While Chinese
                                    Communists must continue to say they will not discuss
                                    ‘ceasefire’ because there is no firing between Communist China
                                    and US—nevertheless it is possible to discuss subject”.</item>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he wanted his comments
                            to be taken as reporting of facts, and not as an argument “for or
                            against” Chinese Communist or US positions whether they were right or
                            wrong, that he had acted at direction of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>, he had not reported to him until
                            his return, and he had made no statements on substance of talks to
                            anyone else but <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked me my personal views
                            on possibility negotiation.</p>
                        <p>I responded by giving US position based on Department messages. I
                            suggested that he would have opportunity talk to Secretary at San
                            Francisco. He said impossible talk there, as satisfactorily and fully as
                            required, and that was reason put in <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> message. Said he <pb n="578" xml:id="pg_578"
                                facs="0606"/>would leave for New York in seven to ten days as if on
                            way San Francisco and any meetings with Secretary at Washington could be
                            handled without undue notice. Said his attitude and that of <gloss
                                target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was not to act in way which could be
                            interpreted as putting pressure on US or making consultations
                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>His attitude throughout hour talk was courteous, reasonable, apparent
                            frankness, desire to talk with President and Secretary indicated
                            throughout conversation. Have no doubt that he convinced Prime Minister
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> of necessity of talks
                            at Washington to present full impression of his talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>, and also convinced him necessity
                            of Prime Minister sending messages to secure fullest consideration by

                                a military tribunal on May 24 of violating Chinese air space and had
                                been sentenced to immediate deportation; see the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >New York Times</hi>, May 31, 1955. The four men were released
                                in Hong Kong on May 31. A statement made on May 30 by a Department
                                of State spokesman expressed gratification at the news, expressed
                                the hope that it signified the intention of the Chinese Communist
                                regime to act swiftly to release the other imprisoned American
                                citizens, and stated that such action would eliminate one cause of

                                    able to take other steps which would make clear that China
                                    wished to release tension. They hoped that Her Majesty’s
                                    Government could induce the United States Government to take
                                    steps on their side which would release tension and commence
                                    negotiations.</item>

                                        Menon</persName>, the Chinese were in favour of diplomatic
                                    contact prior to negotiations such as had already gone on
                                    through the Governments of the Soviet Union, India and the
                                    United Kingdom. At the same time, diplomatic representatives of
                                    China and the United States in Moscow, New Delhi and London
                                    should make contact with each other through the introduction of
                                    the three Governments. These views had been explained to the
                                    Indian and Soviet Governments. He asked Mr. <persName

                                <item>The Chinese Government considered that the main topic in the
                                    negotiations between the United States and the Chinese
                                    Governments should be the easing and removal of tension in the
                                    Formosa area. They had not come to a final view on the form of
                                    negotiations but would see how things develop. They had agreed
                                    to the Soviet proposal for a 10-Power conference, but the number
                                    of countries taking part could be smaller or larger or there
                                    might be direct negotiations between the United States and
                                    Chinese Governments, with other countries assisting “on the
                                    side”. The form would have to be determined by events.</item>

                                    clique” could at no time and in no circumstances take part in
                                    any international conference. But the Chinese Government did not
                                    refuse and in fact suggested direct contact with them. As the
                                    Chinese Government had made clear many times, the liberation of
                                    Formosa was an internal question. The Chinese people were
                                    willing to strive for its liberation by peaceful means as early
                                    as possible and this meant negotiation with <persName

                                    however, two types of negotiations entirely different by nature,
                                    internationally and internally. The Chinese would strive for
                                    both. They could be held in parallel or in succession. They
                                    could not be mixed up although they might have some relation to
                                    each other.</item>

                                    would pass through London and would no doubt have talks with the

                                <item><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> said in
                                    amplification that the first method of proceeding was that the
                                    three Governments should use their good offices in the matter.
                                    For instance, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> had
                                    come to Peking and was now going to Washington. Her Majesty’s
                                    Government had asked for a clarification of the Chinese
                                    Government’s attitude and would no doubt pass appropriate
                                    information to the United States Government. They could then
                                    inform the Chinese Government of the United States Government’s
                                    attitude. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> had
                                    mentioned the question to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName> in Vienna. The second method was that
                                    there should be contact between the United States and Chinese
                                    Missions in the three capitals through the introduction of the
                                    three governments. But without the first form of contact between
                                    Governments, the second would have no significance and would
                                    perhaps even be impossible. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                        En-lai</persName> agreed that the Chinese Government would
                                    not mind whether discussions took place in one, two or three
                                    capitals. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_TH1">Trevelyan</persName>
                                    asked for a clarification of the expression “diplomatic

                                    that he meant the kind of contacts which we were now having as

                                    did not wish at this stage to elaborate any further the scope of

                                    said that discussion at an international conference should
                                    include questions which all parties wished to bring up. It would
                                    not be easy to find a definition of subjects to be discussed
                                    more appropriate than that which he had used.</item>

                                    be two sets of negotiations, one <pb n="583" xml:id="pg_583"

                                    internal. Would timing of these negotiations be a matter for
                                    consideration in the preliminary discussions which the Prime
                                    Minister contemplated in his point (b)? <persName
                                        corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> replied that when he
                                    spoke of “diplomatic contact” he was thinking mainly of
                                    international negotiations. Contact required for internal
                                    questions could be made at any time internally within China. But
                                    question of how Formosa could be peacefully “liberated” could be
                                    touched on during preliminary diplomatic contact.</item>

                            especially as we had told them we had urgent matters to communicate. I
                            thereupon delivered revised lists detained Americans. I then made
                            prescribed statement your 1012 very strongly emphasizing my government’s
                            and <pb n="584" xml:id="pg_584" facs="0612"/>people’s deep grave concern

                        <p>I repeated our previous urgent requests we be furnished prompt detailed
                            up-to-date news re welfare whereabouts these Americans that they be
                            permitted to correspond with their families and expressed our very
                            strong view all be released and repatriated. I contrasted tragic status
                            these Americans in Communist hands with excellent treatment extended by
                            US to Chinese students still in USA who are entirely free to return to
                            Communist China if they wish do so and pointed our how very well and
                            generously they had always been treated. I fully recited and stressed
                            every point in your 1012 and 1045 [<hi rend="italic">1046</hi>]. After I
                            had completed my statement Hsiou read it back to me and then translated
                            it to <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Shen</persName> who reading from
                            prepared statement said “First of all I wish to say I am authorized to
                            inform you that on May 24 of this year Military Tribunal of Supreme
                            Court of Popular Republic of China ordered following Americans
                            immediately expelled from our country, namely: Rowland Williams Parks,
                            Lyle Willis Cameron, <persName>Edwin Louis Heller</persName>, and
                                <persName>Harold Edwin Fischer</persName>, all members American Air
                            Force. While piloting American military planes, they had repeatedly and
                            illegally penetrated air space over our country during period from
                            September 1952 to April 1953. From this action of ours your side can
                            well see our side is desirous to make efforts insofar as that may be
                            possible with a view to contributing to relaxing international
                            tension.”</p>
                        <p>I so confined myself to saying his statement would be reported to my
                            government and asked if these men had already left Red China or if not
                            when they would leave and whence and by what means and if he knew state
                            their health. <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Shen</persName> said he did not
                            know whether they had actually left but that he would inquire and let me
                            know. He then repeated with a smile of complacency his government is
                            desirous to relax international tension. I said we are anxious to see
                            all Americans in Red China released and repatriated. I added their
                            tragic plight continues to cause greatest concern my government and
                            people and that his side could well furnish us with full timely news as
                            to their status and welfare, facilitate exchange correspondence and take
                            action to send all of our people home. (In view delicate political

                            period illegal detention reflects no generosity of course and is nothing
                            in my opinion Communist can brag about. Obviously Communists exploiting
                            every move to spread their well-known propaganda to subserve their own

                                            gratification at the release of the 4 airmen, urged the
                                            release of the 11 airmen, and discussed the possibility
                                            of visits to the latter by their families, a subject

                            <item>Everyone concerned is most appreciative of the efforts which the
                                Secretary General has already made in this matter, as well as his
                                desire to continue to be helpful. Nevertheless the President, as
                                well as State and Defense, feel that the original decision not to
                                enter into any deal with the Communists for the families of the
                                prisoners to go to China was a proper one and was based upon
                                fundamental principles. The conditions which govern this situation
                                are the same today as when the decision was first made.</item>

                            of any importance occurred during his call which he said was of purely

                            specific point of international affairs, made no mention of Formosa or

                            difficulties in attempts to modernize China’s economy.</p>
                        <p>Of somewhat greater interest was conversation he had with Yudin, Soviet

                            given Chinese scientific and technical know-how in atomic field which
                            would eventually enable them, if they so desired, to produce nuclear
                            weapons, they had not given Chinese either bomb itself or facilities for

                            what to do, which is remark of some interest coming from Soviet

                                    <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in London. It
                                stated that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> assumed
                                that both parties wished to enter negotiations and that the Chinese
                                would accept the removal of tension in the Formosa area as the
                                subject of negotiations. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                    >Menon</persName> suggested the initiation of negotiations by
                                contacts between U.S. and Chinese diplomatic representatives in
                                London, New Delhi, or Moscow, and steps on both sides to reduce
                                tensions. The United States, for example, could make it clear that
                                any Chinese student who wished to return to China could do so and,
                                in addition, could grant permission to the airmen’s relatives to
                                visit China. A further measure, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                    >Menon</persName> suggested, would be gradual Nationalist
                                withdrawal from Quemoy and Matsu; while <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                    >Chou</persName> was opposed to a formal cease-fire, he was
                                willing to agree tacitly to a continuation of the current lull in
                                the area while the Nationalist forces withdrew to Formosa.</note> I
                            said that I felt that we should take a very stiff position on the 11
                            airmen and not allow this to get mixed up with the civilians. The
                            President said he was not sure that we were on very strong grounds. I
                            said we had no agreement to return the Chinese civilians here whereas we
                            did have an agreement for the return of our <gloss target="#t_POW1"

                            home but that the <gloss target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s were an explicit
                            undertaking. The President said we had not been able to live up to part
                            of that ourselves, as evidenced by the release by the Koreans of many of

                            extend as long as possible the present tacit avoidance of major
                            hostilities in the Taiwan area and to seek to perpetuate this de facto
                            situation, (3) to convey to <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> (and to the world generally) the sincerity of our
                            intention to seek peaceful solutions to world trouble spots, including
                            Taiwan, and (4) to avoid specific commitments which might limit
                            prematurely our freedom of action in the Taiwan area and in our
                            relations with the Chinese Nationalist Government until we have been
                            able to consider <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>’s views
                            carefully.</p>
                        <p>If our reports from London about <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName>’s views are an accurate reflection of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s remarks to him, it would
                            appear that Peiping has, in fact, a real desire for direct negotiations
                            with the U.S. even at the expense of an indefinite postponement of its
                            “liberation” of Taiwan. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s
                            willingness to adopt a more flexible position for the sake of
                            negotiations with us may indicate a shift in emphasis in his strategy
                            against the Chinese Nationalist Government to a campaign of
                            psychological attrition and subversion. This would be consistent with
                            the continuing Communist objective of destroying Chinese Nationalist
                            prestige by presenting that Government in the light of a mere defeated
                            insurgent regime.</p>
                        <p>The London report of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s remarks
                            to <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> contains the first hint
                            of Chinese Communist willingness to permit peaceful evacuation of the
                            off-shore islands, with the consequent strengthening of Taiwan defenses
                            by these garrisons and equipment. While the Chinese Communists have
                            until recently attempted to focus attention on the status of Taiwan as
                            the real issue for negotiations rather than a cease fire, the <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> talks suggest at least the possibility that the
                            Chinese may be prepared to accept a continuation of the status quo with
                            respect to Taiwan in return for some sort of normalization <pb n="591"
                                xml:id="pg_591" facs="0619"/>of their relations with us, with the
                            prospect that time will be on their side in achieving their ultimate
                            goal regarding Taiwan. Time may, of course, benefit the Communists
                            through deterioration of the situation on Taiwan and through growing
                            world sentiment for a solution which does not accord with our present
                            views, but this need not necessarily be the case. In the present world
                            situation we should be prepared to exploit any reasonable prospect for
                            solving this problem peacefully and seek to make time play for us by
                            demonstrating flexibility in our views. This is particularly necessary
                            with respect to the off-shore islands. Because of the vulnerability of
                            these islands to Communist military attack and because of the prevalent
                            feeling among many of our major allies, to say nothing of the so-called
                            neutralist countries of Asia, that the off-shore islands are not worth
                            fighting for, it seems unlikely that the Communists will be content to
                            extend a de facto cease-fire situation indefinitely. We should avoid
                            being pushed into a position where we (a) either must negotiate under
                            disadvantageous conditions or (b) face increasing Communist military
                            activity against the off-shore islands putting us in the dilemma of
                            allowing them to be lost or engaging ourselves in hostilities which
                            would not have the support of our allies.</p>

                                    tension in the Taiwan area. However, if the U.S. proposed

                                    starting negotiations it would be better to make a gesture of
                                    good will to the United States and to take more concrete action
                                    such as the release of prisoners. <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                        >Chou</persName> replied that he had already decided on the
                                    release of four prisoners as a good will gesture and now it was
                                    the Americans’ turn to make a good will gesture toward China.
                                    Specifically, <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>
                                    proposed the lifting or the relaxation of the embargo from

                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Moekarto</persName> then asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> for the views of the United
                            States on <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s suggestion for
                            lifting the embargo and the views of the United States on the procedure
                            for organizing a conference with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>. These questions appeared to be part of his
                            instructions from <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Ali</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that it was
                            very incongruous for <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            to ask for negotiations while holding Americans as hostages. There is no
                            reason for them to be held except as political hostages. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that the United States
                            does not do business that way. The sooner <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-lai</persName> and others realized that we could not
                            negotiate by blackmail the better off for everybody. Furthermore,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s proposal shows a
                            peculiar mentality not to see the wrongness of methods which are similar
                            to gangster’s. The United States does not intend to accept any such
                            position and American public opinion would find it extremely difficult
                            to negotiate with American boys held as hostages. The Ambassador asked
                            if this meant there would be no negotiations before all prisoners are
                            released. <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0621"/>Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that he did not wish to
                            make any categoric statements since the issue of negotiations is a very
                            large one and since the prisoners had really nothing to do with it.</p>
                        <p>As to the next steps on negotiations with the Chinese Communists, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> referred the
                            Ambassador to the two public statements of the President and Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>.<note n="3"

                            The Ambassador asked if the U.S. would accept a proposal from a third
                            party for negotiations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> replied that we would have to examine the
                            proposal first and that we were not making “A” priority conditions.
                            Ambassador <persName>Moekarto</persName> again asked if there would be
                            any conditions attached to our position. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> replied that the Secretary had taken a very
                            reasonable attitude towards this matter and that in any event the U.S.
                            is never against peaceful resolution of international problems.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName>Moekarto</persName> also explained that following

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked what impressions
                            Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_AM1">Ali</persName> had gained from
                            his trip. The Ambassador replied that the Prime Minister felt <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> was sincere in his
                            intentions to seek peaceful ways to settle the Taiwan problem. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> commented that it was
                            really up to the Chinese to show they had peaceful intentions. It was
                            they who attacked us in Korea, not the reverse. As for trade between
                            Indonesia and Communist China, Ambassador <persName>Moekarto</persName>
                            stated that it was very slight at this time, although an agreement for
                            one year was being concluded in the amount of $56 million to be paid in

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> made clear that he was
                            not acting as the authorized representative of either Communist China or
                            the United States. He was merely trying in a friendly way to prevent a
                            tense situation from becoming worse and developing into war. He reported
                            his talks with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> and the
                            attitude toward the Formosa area. He felt that if direct negotiations
                            should begin, then what he referred to as “lesser” problems such as the
                            prisoners could easily be resolved. The President interrupted at this
                            point to emphasize that the problem of the prisoners was not a minor one
                            but involved principles which were very fundamental and which deeply
                            engaged United States sentiment.</p>
                        <p>There then occurred considerable general discussion between the
                            President, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> and myself
                            as to the status of the prisoners and the non-negotiability of their
                            return. The President emphasized that the Armistice Agreement already
                            provided for this and we did not feel we had to negotiate twice for the
                            same result. The President also mentioned the fact that there were
                            several hundred additional persons from our armed forces who were
                            unaccounted for and who might still be prisoners as to whom no
                            information was obtainable. The President also emphasized that all of
                            the Chinese in this country were free to go if they wanted to.</p>
                        <p>At this point <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> became rather
                            rambling. The President at one point interrupted to say, in relation to
                            Formosa, that the United States was going to be 100% loyal to its
                            obligations; that we were not going to sell anyone into Communist
                            captivity, and that whether our friends were great or small we were
                            equally loyal to our commitments and to our principles. There were some
                            things that we could not negotiate about and still stand upright in the
                            world. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> pleaded for
                            “magnanimity”.</p>
                        <p>It was arranged that I would talk with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> further in the afternoon. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he hoped to be able to see
                            the President again. The President said that if this would serve a
                            useful purpose he was agreeable in principle. However, he pointed out
                            that his schedule <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0623"/>would be very
                            full until at least early July. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said he would be prepared to wait that long and
                            come back after the San Francisco Conference.</p>

                                <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName> spent an hour and a
                            half with the Secretary this afternoon. As Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> did not seem disposed to begin
                            talking himself, the Secretary opened by going over the views of the
                            United States in general terms. He said that the American Government and
                            people have no desire for war with Communist China. This Administration
                            was the one that stopped the war in Korea by concluding the armistice
                            despite some criticism. It had been difficult for the United States to
                            keep those hostilities limited to Korea since there was much pressure in
                            the United States for widening them. If the armistice had not come about
                            when it did, the war probably would have spread. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> nodded agreement. The Secretary
                            then pointed out that, with regard to China, it would be even more
                            difficult than in Korea to limit hostilities for China is an extremely
                            large country and it is difficult to see just where military operations
                            would stop. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the Russians would not be
                            involved. Such hostilities would mean the use of atomic weapons which
                            would lead to the total devastation of Chinese communications and other
                            facilities, leaving 600,000,000 Chinese destitute, and in ruins. Since
                            the United States would then have to sustain the very existence of all
                            the Chinese, there would not be any constructive purpose to such a
                            war.</p>
                        <p>A few months ago the Secretary feared that hostilities with China were
                            inevitable. An ugly situation seemed to be developing <pb n="596"
                                xml:id="pg_596" facs="0624"/>which would lead to war. However, there
                            now appeared to have been a change for the better in recent months.
                            While Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> might disagree,
                            the Secretary felt that the Bandung Conference had had a beneficial
                            effect in that regard. Whatever intentions <persName corresp="#p_CE1"
                                >Chou En-lai</persName> might have had when he came to Bandung, at
                            least it could be said that the opinions expressed by the delegates
                            there must have had a moderating influence. The perceptible improvements
                            in the general situation had been due to the various factors in addition
                            to Bandung. The United States itself had taken several steps to
                            contribute to this atmosphere. The Secretary mentioned the following: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>We helped the Chinese Nationalists to evacuate the Tachen
                                    Islands.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Our Treaty with the Republic of China covered only Taiwan and
                                    the Pescadores although the Chinese Government had pressed to
                                    have the treaty cover the offshore islands.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>We have restrained the Chinese Nationalists from attacking
                                    airfields on the mainland opposite Taiwan despite the fact that
                                    the Chinese Communists have been constructing a large airfield
                                    complex there which for jet aircraft constitute a real threat to
                                    Taiwan. This Chinese Communist air buildup is an extremely
                                    serious matter of great concern to the Chinese Nationalists.
                                    Nevertheless, we had decided in the larger interests of the
                                    situation to restrain the Chinese Nationalists in this regard.
                                    So far we have been able to do this. Nevertheless, the Chinese
                                    Communists are still continuing to rush completion of additional
                                    jet airfields in this area. The Chinese Communists are mounting
                                    a large military buildup across from Formosa which had the very
                                    opposite effect of lessening tension in this area.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>The Secretary mentioned that the United States Government was
                                    looking into the possibility that U.S. aircraft might be
                                    operating too close to or, perhaps, even by mistake, over
                                    Chinese Communist areas, but that the military orders in this
                                    regard now had some revision in order to eliminate this possible
                                    provocation.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>Finally, the U.S. Government had taken steps to facilitate the
                                    return of the Chinese students in America who wish to return to
                                    mainland China.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Secretary told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> that
                            he was outlining this information for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> in order to show him the extent to which the
                            United States, itself, had gone in this whole matter. The Secretary then
                            asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> what he thought
                            might be done, particularly by the Chinese Communists, in the light of
                            his discussions in Peiping.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that India’s
                            interest was precisely the same as that outlined by the Secretary,
                            namely, to avoid war and to reduce tensions. The question is not which
                            side would win a war but how it could be prevented from occurring. He
                            agreed that it would be difficult to keep the war from spreading and
                            that it undoubtedly would involve atomic weapons with all the obvious
                            consequences not only for China but for the rest of the world, even
                            India. He said that <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0625"/>Russia, at
                            least, would supply Communist China with war materials and, perhaps, do
                            even more. As he put it, “we cannot stop the wind and the rain”. So the
                            problem is to see if this dangerous situation can be avoided.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that he had been
                            greatly encouraged by his talks with the Secretary on his previous visit
                            to Washington. The Secretary’s views had been of great help to him in
                            his discussions with the Chinese because he knew the attitude of the
                            President and the Secretary. He then said that in his discussions with
                            the Chinese and Americans there were the following things to ascertain: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>

                            </list></p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> several times made it clear
                            that he did not wish to get into any discussion of the status and
                            disposition of Formosa, although he had his own personal ideas about
                            that. He also felt that this question should not be made part of the
                            initial process of getting direct negotiations started.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the first point, direct negotiations, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> felt that the first important
                            element was to determine quickly whether or not they are possible. He
                            felt they are. He reiterated throughout the afternoon’s conversation the
                            hope that the United States Government would now agree to the idea as
                            well as to some of the other points. On the basis of his talks in
                            Peiping and Washington, he had found a common desire to reduce tensions
                            and to find some way of achieving this objective. Therefore, direct
                            negotiations could be agreed to on the basis of “reducing tensions” but
                            not on the future status of Formosa. The Chinese Communists are really
                            firm, he believes, in wanting peace and in not desiring war. They will
                            refrain from hostilities as long as talks are going on and until
                            negotiations fail. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            emphasized that, in any event, the Chinese Communists will get the
                            offshore islands and that we should make no mistake about that. They now
                            have the force to take the islands if they desire. And if there are
                            negotiations, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> implied that
                            the assumption of Communist control over the offshore islands would be
                            one of the matters to be worked out peacefully. Because of that, the
                            Chinese Communists would be willing to forego use of force to take these
                            islands as long as the talks go on. If the talks fail, then that would
                            mean war. However, he believed it would be better to try negotiations
                            since we would all be no worse off than we are now. At least we would
                            buy time.</p>
                        <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0626"/>
                        <p>The Secretary commented that it often happens that some issues should not
                            be forced prematurely into negotiations in an effort to seek a solution,
                            for such negotiations only lead to a break-off and undesirable results.
                            If matters have not ripened to a point where some settlement can be
                            envisaged, it is better to wait for time to work things out. The
                            Secretary noted that the Chinese traditionally have had the faculty of
                            letting time work things out and have been known for their patience in
                            not pressing for premature solutions. He hoped the Chinese Communists
                            would realize this now. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            agreed. The question of Formosa is one of these issues. The Secretary
                            said he could conceive of no solution at this time, since neither side
                            would disavow their claims. Perhaps Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> had a solution but, in any event, the Secretary
                            felt this whole question might take a long time, perhaps several years
                            to work out. He thought it would be helpful for everybody concerned to
                            realize this. Since the Chinese have lived without Formosa for some
                            sixty years, they can get along without it for some more. Their
                            authority over it was always very tenuous for centuries anyway.
                            Moreover, the United States virtually alone had wrested Formosa away
                            from Japan and we were not now going to return it to a regime
                            proclaiming its hostility toward us. However, while there were
                            advantages in buying time in this kind of situation, that did not mean
                            we were willing to wait indefinitely for the release of Americans
                            unjustly and illegally held by the Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>As to creating the conditions precedent to such negotiations, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> believed that there were certain
                            things that the United States could do and that they were primarily of a
                            negative character. These were: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>(a) To let relatives enter China to visit the American prisoners.
                                        <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> expressed his
                                    personal opinion several times that this would soon result in
                                    the release of all the prisoners, although he specifically said
                                    this unofficially and not for the record. He suggested that
                                    India, if it were desirable, would seek safe passage or other
                                    guarantees that the relatives would be able to leave China and
                                    that they would not be mistreated.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained that such a proposal would be extremely difficult
                            for us to accept. The American public opinion would not see why the
                            prisoners should not be let out in the first place and why more
                            Americans would have to be involved in China. The Chinese Communists are
                            illegally and unjustly holding American prisoners. When Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> demurred, the Secretary said
                            that he thought the question of the prisoners had been settled in the
                            Korean Armistice negotiations. The American people could not be expected
                            to trust the Communists with another promise after they had broken a
                            previous one. It would be like sending another child to the kidnappers
                                <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0627"/>of one’s baby. In short,
                            the Secretary said he did not believe the United States could consider
                            this proposal but at least he would think it over. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>, however, urged this proposal on
                            the Secretary several times.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>The Secretary cited the difficulty of changing recently established
                            passport regulations which prohibit American nationals from entering
                            Communist China.<note n="2" xml:id="d270fn2">The Department of State

                            developing direct negotiations. He believed that the Chinese Communists
                            also have a problem with respect to the release of the prisoners and the
                            creation of suitable conditions for trying to negotiate the reduction of

                            they indicate they will insist on such a policy it will make

                                >Menon</persName> strongly advised against seeking any formal
                            diplomatic arrangements with delegations, agenda, etc. Instead, he
                            suggested we use the pattern established in Geneva between the American
                            and Chinese Consuls. There are questions of a consular nature which
                            could be used as an initial basis for commencing direct exchanges. The
                            question of how many Chinese students there are in the United States
                            actually desiring return to China would be a basis for discussion from
                            the Chinese viewpoint. <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0628"/>While
                            the question of the treatment of American prisoners, the arrangements
                            for Red Cross contacts or even getting the relatives into China, would
                            be a basis for discussion from the American viewpoint. He suggested that
                            the United States and the Chinese Communist Ambassadors in New Delhi,
                            London, and Moscow might begin to have contacts with each other to
                            discuss such questions. Since he could speak only with respect to New
                            Delhi, he felt he could say that New Delhi would be a useful place to
                            begin such contacts since they could be facilitated by people friendly
                            to both sides. As such diplomatic exchanges proceeded, they might move
                            on to wider matters.</p>
                        <p>In a general exposition of the point of view of Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> and himself, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> quite intently explained that
                            India wanted to help increase and promote the prestige of the United
                            States throughout Asia and that India was not opposed to the United
                            States. They hold a different point of view on Formosa than the
                            Americans and they also maintain friendly relation with the Chinese
                            Communists, but the latter fully realize India has a policy of
                            non-alignment and also friendship with the West. India is a much more
                            stable country now than when he was there two years ago. While the
                            Communists in India may win some votes, here and there, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> felt sure that they could no
                            longer take over India, as might have been the case some time past. The
                            leaders of India understand the people and the people support the
                            Government. India will not go the way of <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang Kai-shek</persName> because of ignorance of the people and
                            corruption. Thus, India is following its own way of freedom and can help
                            the United States in Asia. India desires peace and not war.</p>
                        <p>In trying to promote a base for negotiations between China and America,
                            he and the Prime Minister are not trying to establish the rights or
                            wrongs of either party. They are only trying to get the parties together
                            if possible. In approaching this whole matter the United States must
                            also realize that while the Chinese are Communists, they do have strong
                            support of the population throughout China. It will be dangerous to
                            assume otherwise. For all these reasons <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> hoped that the Secretary would give full
                            consideration to the suggestions outlined today. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that he came from Peiping
                            with some hope that it would be possible to work something out.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary responded that he hoped <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName>’s hope was justified.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> replied intensely that his
                            statement of hope was said in utter seriousness and that he wished the

                        <p>During the course of the conversation the subject of American prisoners
                            in China came up at numerous times.</p>
                        <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0629"/>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that this is a fundamental problem for the
                            American Government and people. It seemed to the Secretary that it was
                            very nervy of the Chinese Communists to make these suggestions while
                            Americans languish illegally and unjustly in Chinese jails. This has now
                            become a common pattern of Communist behavior. They use prisoners as
                            hostages to bargain for political advantages. The Russians started doing
                            it in the 1945 surrender terms with the Japanese and Germans. Ten years
                            later the Russians are holding up the return of prisoners to wangle
                            concessions out of the Japanese and German Governments. The Chinese
                            Communists are doing the same thing. The United States cannot tolerate
                            such behavior. Formerly the United States could use force to protect
                            American Nationals mistreated by foreign powers. There is great pressure
                            in America today for getting the American prisoners out. However, the
                            use of force in the modern world is a different story than it used to
                            be. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> acknowledged the
                            importance of releasing these prisoners but said that India is not going
                            into the rights and wrongs of either party, his talks in Peiping had
                            been much more broadly based than the release of prisoners, which indeed
                            had been the narrow and unsuccessful base for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Secretary General’s unfortunate efforts, the United
                            States should not insist on the release as a precondition to everything
                            else, and, finally, the question of prisoners would have to be solved in
                            the larger context that he had been talking about. He told the Secretary
                            that the Chinese Communist decision to release the prisoners had been
                            taken on May 19. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> to hold up the
                            release and its publicity until May 30 to enable him to return to New
                            Delhi and relay the information to Washington and to arrange the desired
                            publicity. This had all worked to create better conditions. Therefore,
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> hoped the United
                            States would do the same thing <hi rend="italic">again</hi> to
                            capitalize on any additional steps to reduce tensions in order to
                            improve the general atmosphere. He referred to the visits of relatives
                            in China and to the release of all Chinese students in this country
                            wanting to return to China. The Secretary said that there was one
                            Chinese student deliberately held back because he had highly classified
                            material and because he had also improperly used it. However, the United
                            States might consider waiving this objection under certain circumstances
                            if it would help.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the effect of the Bandung Conference on the Chinese
                            Communists, <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> went to some
                            length to explain that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            had not come to Bandung to get support for issues vital to the Chinese
                            Communists. Whether this was a matter of policy or not, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said it was a fact that
                                <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had refrained from
                            asking support or asking the Conference to endorse his stand. The issues
                            were deliberately avoided. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            apparently considered this significant.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked the
                            Secretary to study his suggestions and said that he would have to have
                            several more discussions with the Secretary and, if possible, with the
                            President. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he would
                            like to see the Secretary again in San Francisco and that perhaps they

                            prior US agreement for <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> bombing of
                            Fukien airfields I conveyed substance of Department’s position to
                            Foreign Minister and requested interview with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> where three of us could discuss
                            matter. He immediately informed President of Department’s attitude and I
                            have since referred to matter in conversations with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> on several occasions. However,
                            President’s annual inspections of military establishments and spate of
                            US official visitors resulted in others being present before whom it was
                            preferable to avoid detailed discussion. Shortly before second reference
                            telegram was received I learned President would see me this morning with
                            Foreign Minister before latter’s departure for San Francisco later
                            today.</p>
                        <p>Meanwhile I took precaution on June 9 of summarizing Department’s
                            position in memo to Foreign Minister which <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> today told me had passed on to him.</p>
                        <pb n="603" xml:id="pg_603" facs="0631"/>
                        <p>In this morning’s conversation I stated once more US position that
                            offensive action by <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> against Fukien
                            airfields requires our prior agreement except in clear-cut case of
                            retaliation.</p>
                        <p>I went on to say that without in any way diluting US position as stated,
                            it would seem to me unfortunate for our governments to become involved
                            in argument over hypothetical case.</p>
                        <p>Fact that Fukien airfields in question are near seacoast and vulnerable
                            to attack suggest their primary purpose is for staging and that
                            concentration of aircraft such as to provide suitable bombing target
                            seemed unlikely.</p>
                        <p>I proposed in future that matter be lifted to higher level and considered
                            part of broader question of retaining control of air over Taiwan Strait
                            which essential to defense of Taiwan as well as Kinmen and Matsu. I
                            assumed responsible <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and US Air Force
                            commanders would continue close consultation as situation developed and
                            would make recommendations re any appropriate action to meet given
                            situation as it arose. I assumed in this connection there would be prior
                            consultation with US before any offensive action taken.</p>
                        <p>In reply President <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> took
                            note of US position. While he did not now wish to alter what he said
                            during Admiral <persName corresp="#p_SAFB1">Stump</persName>’s visit, he
                            thought matter could be left in abeyance. He indicated agreement with my
                            proposal that question be considered hereafter in broader terms of
                            maintaining control of air over Strait.</p>

                        <p>I said that I did not think that what happened to the prisoners was as
                            important as the way in which it happened. If the Chinese Communists
                            wanted to begin to gain respect as decent people, they would let the
                            prisoners go. If they would only let them go on condition that we did
                            things that we would not otherwise do, then they were using human lives
                            for blackmail purposes. Even if we acceded and got the prisoners out,
                            the result would not be to improve relations. We would have demeaned
                            ourselves, and the Chinese Communists would have given another
                            illustration of their unwillingness to act in a civilized way. The
                            release of the prisoners under these circumstances would make matters
                            worse, rather than better.</p>
                        <p>As regards the press, I said we could not give passports by whim as he
                            suggested to one or two people—either we gave passports to China or we
                            did not. If we gave passports, then anyone was entitled to go unless
                            there was some legal reason to prevent him. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he had not realized this,
                            and thought that issuing passports was purely discretionary.</p>
                        <p>I made no comment on the “hypothetical” case.</p>
                        <p>I said I did not want yet to tell him officially that all the Chinese
                            students could go, as I wanted to think the situation over a little bit
                            more.</p>
                        <p>He asked if he could see me again in San Francisco. I said that if he
                            were out there, we could probably set up some time when we could talk
                                further.<note n="3" xml:id="d272fn3">No record of any conversation

                        <p>I suggested that some arrangement might be made whereby some third
                            government could look after the interests of Americans in China
                            generally and also look after those Chinese in this country who wanted
                            to go back to Communist China. I said the latter were not now
                            represented because since we did not recognize Communist China, there
                            was no third government to look out for their interests here as was
                            normally the case when diplomatic relations were broken.</p>

                        <p>I told the President that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            was troublesome, because he was mixing up the channels of communication,
                            and no one knew quite where we stood, particularly <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. The President agreed, but said that he
                            did not see that we could do any less in view of the personal plea from
                                <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>.</p>
                        <p>I told the President that I had thought of the possibility of having an
                            exchange of Commissioners from Communist China and the United States
                            with a view to clearing up the situation on both sides and dealing with
                            the PW’s and also the civilians in China, and also letting them check up
                            on the Chinese students in the United States. I said I thought this
                            might perhaps be a way out of the present impasse. The President said he
                            thought this was a good idea and would favor it. I said I thought of
                            this as an alternative to using representatives of third powers. The
                            President said too he thinks that direct dealing was apt to be more
                            effective.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> raised the question
                            of China. He said he felt that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> was messing things up and perhaps giving the
                            Chinese Communists the feeling that some precise formula could be
                            arrived at, and that if it did not work out that way, then they might
                            feel that the alternative was to resort to force. I said I agreed that
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> had <pb n="606"

                                particular solution to the problem of Formosa and expressed the hope

                            behalf of the 11 prisoners, and I felt that situation had slipped
                            backwards as the result of <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                            >Menon</persName>’s meddling.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> asked what I had in
                            mind for the future. I said the only thought I had about the prisoner
                            situation was that possibly we might have, either directly or through
                            third countries, an exchange of commissioners, one from each side; that
                            our commissioner would go to China with a view to getting out the
                            Americans, both military and civilian, and the commissioner from the
                            Communist side could come here to check up on the Chinese students and
                            be sure that the ones who wanted to return had authority to leave the
                            country. It had occurred to me that this exchange might serve to save
                            the face of the Chinese. I said this was just a vague idea, and it had
                            not been cleared in any way in the Department. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> thought that this idea had
                            merit. He suggested that anything we did along these lines could better
                            be done through the British than through the Indians. He did not think
                            the Indians were very reliable and that they talked a great deal without
                            accomplishing anything.</p>
                        <p>He then asked as to the other aspects of the matter. I said I thought
                            that there was nothing to be done but to wait [for] the processes of
                            evolution, that it might be a five-year matter before we knew whether
                            the Chinese Communists would really maintain their hold on the country
                            or possibly break down; or on the other hand, whether they were going to
                            adopt standards of conduct such that they could be received into decent
                            society. The processes of time would also have a bearing upon the
                            Formosan situation. At the present time, <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> had to speak in terms of using his army to
                            recapture the Mainland because otherwise it was difficult to hold their
                            loyalty. However, as those who came from the Mainland were gradually
                            replaced by Formosans, their interest would shift more to defense and
                            away from offense. No one could know just how the future would evolve.
                            The main thing was to give it a chance to evolve without war. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said that one of the
                            troubles was that they were so close together, and he spoke of Quemoy
                            and Matsu. I said that I was sure it was not feasible to bring about any
                                <pb n="607" xml:id="pg_607" facs="0635"/>evacuation of these islands
                            at the present time. I said that if it was apparent that there was not
                            going to be fighting, there might be a reduction in the size of the
                            Chinese Nationalist forces on the islands, but that I thought that
                            evacuation must be regarded as out of the question at least for the time
                            being.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said it was very
                            interesting for them to know how our mind was working on these matters,
                            because they could accommodate themselves to our thinking if they knew
                            what it was.<note n="4" xml:id="d274fn4"><persName corresp="#p_MH1"

                                    forces were to be accorded the same treatment in jurisdictional
                                    matters as <gloss target="#t_MAAG1">MAAG</gloss> personnel. A

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> then said the three
                            topics he mentioned for discussion at Geneva were illustrations and
                            would not necessarily preclude their bringing up other matters. He
                            thought also that the Soviets would propose a six-power conference on
                            Far Eastern matters. I asked whether the number had been increased from
                            five to six to make place for the Chinese Nationalists. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said no—the number of six was
                            proposed to include India.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our discussion, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> also raised the question of the <hi

                            United States could do something to relieve that situation. I replied
                            that I had already mentioned this topic to <persName

                            position to give orders to the Chinese Nationalist Government. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he believed the
                            United States had certain influence. I said that we, of course, were
                            greatly concerned over the Americans who were held prisoner by the
                            Chinese Communists. I mentioned that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Krishna Menon</persName> was working on this subject but I <pb

                            matters much. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> replied
                            that he had the impression that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> was trying hard and making some progress. He also
                            said he was interested that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna
                                Menon</persName> was getting a much better press in the United

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_KVKW1">Koo</persName> said that his
                            Government felt some anxiety at the prospect of U.S. negotiations with
                            Communist countries. This concern was a natural result of the efforts
                            being made by <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> and others
                            who were known to be sympathetic to the Communist side. He said he would
                            like to be able to report to his Government that the U.S. position on
                            Far Eastern policy questions, particularly those directly affecting his
                            Government, remained unchanged. Specifically he would like to be able to
                            report that there was no change in U.S. opposition to the seating of
                            Communist China in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, and in the
                            U.S. policy of non-recognition of the Chinese Communist regime.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said there was no
                            change in attitude on the policy matters mentioned by the Ambassador.
                            The Secretary has explicitly stated that this Government would not
                            negotiate on matters affecting the essential interests of the Government
                            of China without the participation of that Government.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said he was convinced that the Chinese Communists are
                            using the American prisoners as political pawns. He hoped that the U.S.
                            would not compromise its principles as a result of Chinese Communist
                            attempts to use the American prisoners for <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612"
                                facs="0640"/>political purposes. He recalled that the Secretary had
                            stated that the U.S. desired peace, but that it would have to be “peace
                            with honor”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he of
                            course agreed that the Chinese Communists were trying to exploit the
                            prisoners for political gain. He said that he considered the Chinese
                            Communists to be gangsters, kidnappers, and extortioners. There were
                            three courses which we could follow: (1) we could use force against the
                            Chinese Communists if the prisoners were not released; (2) we could
                            appease and accommodate the Chinese Communists, thus probably securing
                            the release of all our people by giving in completely to the Chinese
                            Communist demands; (3) we could use a policy of pressures, diplomatic
                            representations through friendly third countries, and direct
                            conversations with the Chinese Communists, as we are now doing. The
                            first two alternatives are of course out of the question. Use of force
                            would probably not bring about the release of the prisoners. It would
                            more likely have an opposite effect and might easily spread into the
                            disaster of a global atomic war. Appeasement of the Chinese Communists
                            would also be catastrophic in a different way and was equally
                            unthinkable. The only sensible course was No. 3, which we have been
                            following consistently. This takes much patience because it is
                            exasperating and frustrating, but it gradually gets some results. 23
                            Americans have been released since last June. There is no sound
                            alternative to this course, unsatisfactory as it is. We intend to
                            continue working along this line.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked if Foreign

                        <p>The Ambassador said he had urged Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1"

                            other Departmental representatives. This would undoubtedly be very
                            useful. However, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_YGKCYK1">Yeh</persName> felt
                            that he could not well spare the time to come to Washington now. The
                            Ambassador doubted that he would come, although no final decision had
                            been made. The Ambassador mentioned that Dr. <persName

                                already a difficult problem, and that the shift would increase the

                            discussion relating to China. According to the memorandum of the
                            discussion,</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> discussed
                                developments noted on the airfields in Communist China, the transfer
                                of additional jet bombers and MIG 15’s to Communist China, and the
                                similar transfer of four Russian submarines and two destroyers. Mr.

                                    >Dulles</persName>’ above comments, the President said that the
                                Burmese Prime Minister had made a very odd remark to him at lunch
                                yesterday. He said that the Chinese Communists were getting
                                absolutely nothing from the outside world that they were not obliged
                                to pay for. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said
                                that this was probably true even of what they obtained from the
                                Soviets, but the significant question was the price. The President
                                replied that he understood that all the trade of Communist China was
                                in goods, not cash. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> called attention to the existence of a

                                    >Allen Dulles</persName> acknowledged the existence of this
                                loan, but said that <gloss target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss> believed
                                that it was pretty well exhausted. He added that the Chinese were
                                selling rice in order to get rubber from Ceylon, despite the grave
                                food shortage in Communist China.”</p>

                                        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> said he
                                    understood that the Chinese Nationalists were preparing to send
                                    another division to reinforce the troops already on Quemoy. We
                                    had opposed this move but had apparently been overruled. This
                                    was a serious matter, in Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                        >Dulles</persName>’ view, and the United States had a

                                    with the mutual defense treaty, to prevent such moves. Secretary
                                        <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> believed that

                                    been set for the transfer of this division; nor, indeed, had
                                    U.S. authorities in Formosa agreed to such a move. The <persName

                                        corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> again stressed the right
                                    of the United States to block the move. The President said he
                                    would like to be kept informed of developments in the

                                    or no notice. The President answered that of course they could

                                    Moreover, it was proceeding rapidly and urgently. The Chinese

                                >MDAP</gloss> Agreement with Cambodia.”]</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> raised a question about our
                            attitude towards <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s
                            proposal for direct talks. The Secretary said that he had publicly
                            replied to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s suggestions and
                            he wished to make clear that we would be willing to have direct talks on
                            limited matters of concern to our two countries, with the understanding
                            that no recognition is involved. Some five intermediaries, however, have
                            been attempting to explore these problems further. We have therefore
                            postponed action until such time as all possible information has become
                            available. Some difficulties will be presented by discussions on when,
                            how and where to meet, and the agenda. On the other hand, we are not
                            willing in such talks to deal with the interests of third parties.
                            Reference was made to the direct talks already taking place at Geneva
                            between our Consul General and the Communist Chinese representative
                            there, these talks being limited to the civilian prisoners in China.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> referred to talks at a
                            higher level. There is a difference of opinion on one point: the United
                            States desires to discuss a cease-fire when no firing is taking place
                            between the United States and China.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we had in mind talking about the possibility of
                            avoiding armed clashes. We certainly would not talk about the disposal
                            of Taiwan. What we want is to assure that the problems can be worked out
                            peacefully. As for the substantive aspects of the problems we must await
                            the evolution of time, for if substantive matters are forced, no
                            decision can be reached under present conditions and an armed clash
                            would surely result. The <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> wants to
                            get Taiwan which they haven’t had for 60 years. Even the juridical
                            position of Taiwan is in doubt. The United States also has an interest
                            in <pb n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0648"/>Taiwan which we got away
                            from Japan. Japan has merely renounced sovereignty over Taiwan which has
                            not been disposed of by the peace treaty and not ceded to anyone.
                            Consequently the United States also could assert a legal claim until
                            Taiwan is disposed of by some means. We cannot, therefore, admit that
                            the disposition of Taiwan is merely an internal problem.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> said that the Chinese
                            Communists are willing to have direct talks with <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName> regarding a cease-fire.
                            They would be willing to receive representatives of the Chinese National
                            Government in Peiping or to send a mission to Taipei. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> said he was quite prepared
                            to do this. The Secretary responded that we would not try to stop such
                            negotiations but evinced some doubt that <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U
                                Nu</persName> was correctly informed on this point. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> reiterated that he had discussed
                            this matter with <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>,
                            first at Bandung and subsequently at Rangoon.<note n="2"

                            then waited until his Embassy at Peiping could confirm again <persName

                            negotiations before making any further communication on the subject. He
                            hoped that the Secretary would find it possible to persuade the Chinese
                            National Government to have such talks although he understood that
                            pressure would not necessarily cause <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> to follow our advice. The Secretary commented
                            that both parties had publicly refused to have talks of the kind
                            envisaged and that <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>’s proposal
                            represented a new departure. <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>
                            underscored the fact that the United States would not be a party to such
                            discussions, which would be considered an internal affair.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to our treaty relations with Formosa and explained
                            that we are in a position to assure the <gloss target="#t_CPR1"

                            has quieted down. He referred to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName>’s desire to use his air power to interfere with
                            the buildup of the Chinese Communist air power opposite Taiwan and spoke
                            at length of our refusal to give our consent to such action. In response
                            to <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>’s question regarding a
                            general lack of Chinese Communist planes, pilots, etc., Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> spoke of the buildup of
                            Chinese Communist air strength as well as the continued violation of the
                            armistice in North Korea. The Secretary referred to the problem of
                            disarmament when no arrangement under which the Communists can be
                            trusted appears feasible. He said that this was the greatest obstacle to
                            carrying out agreements with the Communists.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> thought that it would be
                            advisable to divide the talks into two parts: (a) direct talks between
                            the Chinese Communists and <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0649"
                            />Taiwan, and (b) direct talks between the United States and the <gloss
                                target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> on a higher level and on an agreed
                            agenda. The Secretary again expressed doubt regarding the offer for
                            talks between Taiwan and the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, but
                                <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> reaffirmed what we had
                            previously said. He commented that he had offered to visit Taiwan but
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had asked him not
                            to go.</p>
                        <p>Reference was made to the prisoner problem, the Secretary saying that it
                            is difficult to know just where we are in view of the conflicting
                            information which we receive.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> whether he
                            thought the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> wishes to avoid
                            fighting. <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> said that he cannot
                            read their minds but had learned a lesson in the Korean war. He had then
                            felt the Chinese would not intervene. He said that the Secretary had
                            stated in a speech that the United States would interfere if there were
                            intervention in Indochina, but that the Chinese had nevertheless
                            intervened. The Secretary read the relevant excerpt from his speech of a
                            year ago.<note n="4" xml:id="d282fn4">Reference is apparently to the
                                Secretary’s address of June 11, 1954, before the Los Angeles World

                                    >Bulletin</hi>, June 28, 1954, pp. 971–973.</note> He had
                            actually said, in effect, that if Red China were to send its army into
                            Indochina it could not do so without grave consequences.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> said that fear of war
                            apparently does not deter the Chinese Communists. On the other hand they
                            made it plain to him that they understand that the United States is not
                            bluffing. He also felt that the Chinese Communists likewise are not
                            bluffing. The mere threat of war therefore, would not act as a
                            deterrent.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary spoke at length regarding the necessity to be patient and
                            to let time take care of some of these problems. He felt that there will
                            be an evolution in both places, i.e., on the mainland and on Taiwan, and
                            that we should not force the issues because to do so would cause a break
                            and only war would result. He pointed out that the Chinese Nationalists,
                            too, are impatient and feel that they must attack the mainland. We have
                            used our influence in that respect and have obtained an agreement from
                            them that they will not attack. If the <gloss target="#t_CPR1"
                                >CPR</gloss> is not willing to let time contribute towards a
                            solution, the situation will eventually lead to war. He felt that it
                            does not make sense to push things too fast as with time the situation
                            in that area will change, although we do not know how at this time. He
                            recalled that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> also
                            desperately wishes to unite Korea. We also believe Korea should be
                            united, but not by force. We stopped any movement towards use of force
                            by withholding ammunition, equipment and supplies. In Germany, a similar
                            situation exists: Adenauer agreed to give up force as a means to reunite
                            Germany. In consequence, <pb n="622" xml:id="pg_622" facs="0650"/>it is
                            not understandable why the Chinese Communists should be allowed to take
                            territory by force while they preach peace. They wish peace only on
                            their terms. To our way of thinking, if peace means anything it means
                            the renunciation of force in accordance with the United Nations Charter.
                            He felt that we should allow the situation to evolve for in this way
                            these divided countries will eventually be united. He hoped that the
                            Chinese Communists would be patient. If they are not, they will bring
                            about the consequences of force.</p>

                        <p>After inconsequential remarks lasting perhaps five minutes, during which
                            each participant gave the other full opportunity to begin discussions of
                            substance, the Secretary remarked that one of his chief difficulties was
                            to decide who, among five or six people who had indicated to him that
                            they could speak with authority as to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>’s views, did in fact have such authority. He said
                            that some responsible individuals presented quite different and even
                            contrary views from others. He mentioned that Prime Minister <persName
                                corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> of Burma had just given him some
                            new thoughts. He was beginning to wonder whether Peking had many lines
                            out, hoping to reap the best advantage it could from the reports which
                            all these people brought back.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that there was no
                            trick. It was up to the United States, of course, to draw its own
                            conclusions, but he himself had not heard any divergence in the
                            presentation of <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s
                            position.</p>
                        <pb n="623" xml:id="pg_623" facs="0651"/>
                        <p>The Secretary referred to the competition which seemed to be building up
                            with regard to handling the question of American prisoners in China. He
                            did not believe that a half dozen people working on this problem could
                            accomplish as much as one person charged with full responsibility.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asserted that he had no
                            desire whatever to enter into any competition, that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> could say and do what he
                            liked on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary pointed out that there was a domestic problem inside the
                            United States regarding the prisoners. Their relatives had appealed to
                            members of Congress, many of whom were demanding strong action. He had
                            taken the position before Congressional committees that the primary
                            responsibility for obtaining their release rested with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, at least in the first instance. He asked
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> if the latter thought
                            we should now say that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> had failed.
                            This would be a serious decision since demands for punitive action by
                            the US would undoubtedly become stronger.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he did not think
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> should withdraw from the matter
                            and he did not believe that several persons working on it did any
                            harm.</p>
                        <p>As regards the larger problem, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said the question was to determine whether there
                            existed a basis for negotiation leading to a relaxation of tensions. He
                            did not think that negotiation could take place while serious fighting
                            was going on. A climate must therefore be created for the cessation of
                            violence. Since practically the only violence now taking place was
                            around Quemoy and Matsu, those two islands seemed to be the crux of the
                            immediate problem. If the Chinese Communists tried to take the islands
                            by force, the United States would either have to intervene or suffer a
                            loss of prestige. Both he and his Prime Minister were anxious, he said,
                            to avoid such loss of prestige by the United States. He was aware that
                            no actual talks about the islands or anything else could take place
                            while the American prisoners were in jail, but the basis for the talks
                            could be discussed.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that it was not necessary for the prisoners to be
                            released in order to enable talks to take place. He pointed out that in
                            his statement, following the Bandung Conference, expressing willingness
                            to negotiate with Peking, he had attached no conditions. He agreed that
                            the conversations would be carried on in a much more favorable
                            atmosphere after the prisoners were released, but he had never demanded
                            their release as a prior condition.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked how a state of
                            non-violence could be achieved until the question of the islands was
                            settled. The Secretary asked what islands he had in mind. If Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> took the position that
                            coastal islands off China had to be turned over to Peking in order to
                                <pb n="624" xml:id="pg_624" facs="0652"/>achieve peace, what about
                            Hong Kong. It was geographically, ethnically and economically as close
                            to China as Quemoy and Matsu. He pointed out that the Chinese Communists
                            had occupied the mainland for five years, 1950–1954, without fighting
                            for Quemoy and Matsu. Why had they suddenly become so excited about
                            them? Perhaps it was because they had been waiting for the buildup of
                            their air bases nearby in order to take them by force. The use of force
                            could not achieve peace in the Far East any more than in any other area
                            of the world. Force could only be met with force. “The United States not
                            only will not but cannot now bring about the evacuation of Quemoy and
                            Matsu”, he said.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked, “Then, what is
                            your idea of the future?” The Secretary said that the present situation
                            should be accepted, since the problem was one which could only be solved
                            by time. If a solution were sought by force, the only answer would be by
                            the sword. He said he could not understand the sudden demand for an
                            immediate solution since now there was no solution to the basic problem
                            except war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> referred to the buildup
                            of military strength on the islands. The Secretary said there was also a
                            buildup on the mainland opposite. If a different trend could be started
                            in one area, it also might be achieved in the other.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he could see no
                            backdown by the other side (i.e. Peking) if the coastal islands remained
                            as they were. He felt that there must be some possibility for a peaceful
                            settlement. The Secretary said he sincerely hoped so. “We are doing
                            everything in our power to prevent the use of force to achieve
                            unification of Korea, Germany and Vietnam. Why should the Chinese
                            Communists be the only ones to use force to achieve unification?”, he
                            asked.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> referred to the use of
                            force by Formosa. The Secretary said we were trying to avoid the use of
                            force by both sides.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that the Secretary
                            could win debater’s points but what was needed was a peaceful
                            settlement. “Then we agree”, said the Secretary. He repeated that he
                            could no more discuss the evacuation of Quemoy and Matsu than he would
                            expect Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> to discuss
                            withdrawal of the Communists from the mainland. He emphasized that time
                            and time alone was the only answer. If the Communist Chinese took the
                            position that a solution must come now, they would have to take the
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked whether Quemoy
                            and Matsu were a part of China. The Secretary asked again whether Hong
                            Kong was a part of China. He agreed that Quemoy and Matsu were
                            geographically a part of China but said they were not politically a part
                            of Red China any more than Hong Kong was. He declared that if a person
                            does not <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0653"/>love peace enough to
                            let time have its curative opportunity, that person was not a very
                            devout lover of peace.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> remarked that in the
                            beginning of the conversation the Secretary had questioned his right to
                            speak for the Chinese Communists. He declared that he had never tried to
                            do so. If anyone had different views regarding the position of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>, he would be interested to
                            learn them. The Secretary said he could not divulge what others had said
                            in confidence, but that he had received four or five reports. Some
                            people, for example, thought that the best means of finding a solution
                            would be through direct talks between <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_MT1"
                            >Mao</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked whether the
                            Secretary was saying to him in polite but frank terms, “Thank you for
                            nothing”. The Secretary said he was not. He said he was merely pointing
                            out that he did not know who really represented the views of Peking. On
                            the question of prisoners, he said he hesitated to negotiate behind the
                            back of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he was not “negotiating”
                            regarding the prisoners or regarding anything else. The Secretary said
                            Secretary General <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>
                            might have a different opinion on this subject. If the Chinese Reds
                            thought they could get something out of us through Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> or someone else, they would
                            never talk to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                            >Hammarskjold</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> remarked that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> had gone to
                            Peking and had had his say. The Secretary asked “Is it your position
                            that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> has failed? If so, what do I
                            say to the United States Senate?” Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> said he thought, with all respect, that the
                            Secretary could say that both the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and
                            others were active on the prisoner question. The Secretary said that
                            four or five channels could not be pursued effectively.</p>
                        <p>“If our efforts have been harmful”, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> replied, “we can withdraw”. He asked whether the
                            Secretary felt that India’s efforts had been harmful. The Secretary said
                            that he did not think the intent had been harmful—quite the contrary. He
                            was confident that the Indian motives had been the best, but the result
                            had been that <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName>’s
                            efforts had been nullified. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> commented that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName> represented an organization of which the US
                            was a party. He said the messages which President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName> and the Secretary had sent
                            to his Prime Minister had not indicated any feeling that India was
                            interfering. He declared that it was extremely embarrassing to him that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HD1">Hammarskjold</persName> took a contrary
                            view. He thought that if one side took the position that one particular
                            channel had to be used, the talks might not progress favorably.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he was willing to look at the question from every
                            angle. It might, in fact, be that <persName corresp="#p_HD1"
                                >Hammarskjold</persName>’s efforts had been harmful. If so, they
                            should be called off. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            said <pb n="626" xml:id="pg_626" facs="0654"/>he did not think so. The
                            Secretary then asked him directly “Do you think the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts have been harmful or not?”. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he could not
                            answer that question. The Secretary said he understood that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> did think the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> efforts were harmful. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he should not be required
                            to answer that question. As for himself, he could not discuss the
                            general situation in Peking without also talking about the prisoners.
                            The Secretary said that all he could say about the prisoners was that
                            their release would improve the atmosphere, but he was not willing to
                            bargain for their release. He said he had presumed that Peking wanted to
                            obtain international recognition to get into the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> and to achieve relaxations and peace. Perhaps he was
                            wrong. If so, we must face the consequences.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that he had not
                            pressed the prisoners question but that it had been pushed forward by
                            public opinion in the US. He thought the American public had an
                            incorrect idea of Communist China. He said China was quite different
                            from Russia, and asserted that different political parties exist in
                            China today. He was confident that Peking wanted good relations with the
                            US because it was not happy to remain dependent on the friendship of
                            only one great power.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had seen no evidence of such a desire on the part
                            of Peking. It was entirely within the ability of Red China, within the
                            next few years, to achieve recognition by the US and membership in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>, but they were certainly not
                            acting now in a manner to achieve those ends. They could not shoot their
                            way into the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. If anyone wished to join
                            a club, he should not go about it by insulting the members of the
                            Admissions’ Committee.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary emphasized that negotiations at this time designed to bring
                            about a quick solution to the entire problem could be very dangerous
                            because they would be more likely to end in war than in peace. If
                            negotiations could deal with marginal aspects of the question and were
                            very carefully handled, they might be helpful, but if matters were
                            brought to a head now, the results might be catastrophic. He emphasized
                            once more that he could not negotiate the evacuation of Quemoy and
                            Matsu.</p>
                        <p>The discussion terminated with an expression by the Secretary of his
                            belief that the discussions with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> had been useful and a readiness to receive any
                            further thoughts Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> might
                            have regarding marginal subjects which might be discussed without
                            precipitating a crisis.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked when he might see
                            the Secretary again. The Secretary suggested July 6 at 11:00 a.m.</p>

                        <p>The exchange of commissioners with Communist China for the purpose of
                            settling the prisoner and student issues would have a certain appeal and
                            would probably be acceptable to the Communists but on balance, I
                            believe, it would be undesirable for the following reasons: <list>

                                <item>Acceptance by us of a Communist commissioner to inquire into
                                    the status of Chinese students in this country would, it seems
                                    to me, be inconsistent with our position that the Chinese
                                    Nationalist Government is the only legitimate Chinese government
                                    and accredited representative and protector of Chinese Nationals
                                    and Chinese interests abroad. It is for this reason that we have
                                    gone to some lengths to maintain this thesis and have resisted
                                    the idea of accepting a “protecting power” to represent
                                    Peiping’s interests in this country. We are making a major
                                    effort to prevent overseas Chinese from giving allegiance to the
                                    Peiping regime by stressing that the Chinese government on
                                    Taiwan is the sole appropriate representative of Chinese
                                    Nationals and Chinese interests abroad. For us even by
                                    implication to acknowledge the right of the Chinese Communist
                                    regime to claim the allegiance of or extend protection to
                                    Chinese Nationals in this country, would, in my opinion, tend to
                                    impair morale on Taiwan and elsewhere in the Far East and
                                    appreciably weaken the position of the Chinese Nationalists
                                    Government.</item>

                                    and quasi diplomatic status of sorts and the term carries a

                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>. I said I find it very difficult
                            to make progress with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>
                            because he was so vague. <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>
                            asked what he had sought. I said nothing very specific, but in general
                            he wanted to bring about a quick solution of the existing differences
                            through negotiation. I said that I was convinced that only trouble would
                            come from attempting to bring present issues to a head by negotiation at
                            the present time. A lapse of time was needed to make problems more
                            manageable. If the Chinese Communists really wanted to be accepted and
                            dealt with as respected members of the community, then they would have
                            to take time to persuade others that they had decent intentions. At the
                            present time, the record was overwhelmingly against them. They had been
                            aggressors in Korea and were so found by the United Nations. They had
                            promoted the fighting in Indochina. They had threatened to use force to
                            achieve their objectives in the Taiwan area. They had held our prisoners
                            in a manner which every impartial student of the subject recognized was
                            a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. They were holding United
                            States civilians against their will. In this atmosphere, little could be
                            accomplished. On the other hand, the future was largely for the Chinese
                            Communists themselves to make. The American people were traditionally
                            willing to forget and forgive; and no doubt in time the Chinese
                            Communists, if they were really capable of, and disposed to, acting
                            decently, could win a considerable measure of acceptance. This, however,
                            was a question of their own character and will and of time; and
                            meanwhile I saw no possibility of a negotiated solution of major issues.
                            There were marginal issues which might perhaps be dealt with on a
                            negotiated basis as, as I had indicated we were prepared to discuss, a
                            cease-fire in the Formosa (Taiwan) Straits.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> said that he was well aware of
                            the fact that the American people were generous and friendly in
                            character. He hoped, however, that negotiations could proceed in the
                            interest of peace. He again spoke of direct negotiations between the
                            Chinese Communists and <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0658"/>the
                            Chinese Nationalists with reference to a cease-fire, pointing out that
                            the Chinese Communists took the position that there was no “firing”
                            between them and the United States, but only between them and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s and that therefore the matter
                            was essentially a domestic issue to be discussed merely between the two
                            of them. <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> said that he was
                            again cabling to <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> to
                            get confirmation of the fact that they would indeed be willing to sit
                            down and negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s.
                            I said that if they were willing to talk with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s at all, why would they not be
                            willing to do so in the context perhaps of a conference including
                            others. I pointed to the fact that although the fighting in Indochina
                            was considered by many to be essentially a civil war, nevertheless the
                            participants had sat down at Geneva with others, such as Soviet Russia,
                            the <gloss target="#t_UK1">UK</gloss> and the US, which were not
                            participants in the civil war.</p>
                        <p>I mentioned again the matter of the flyers, pointing out that while I did
                            not formally connect the handling of the flyers with the Taiwan matters,
                            nevertheless, obviously, the Chinese Communists’ conduct with reference
                            to the flyers affected the atmosphere.</p>
                        <p>I referred to the direct negotiations going on at Geneva between the
                            United States and the Chinese Communists, and said that there was a
                            possibility that the level of these talks might perhaps be raised.
                                <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName> indicated he thought that
                            would be a good idea.</p>
                        <p>I again emphasized the importance of maintaining peace for a time during
                            which it could have a curative effect.</p>
                        <p>I spoke briefly of the Geneva Conference and problems of disarmament. I
                            felt that the main issue was whether any agreement could be properly
                            policed. I spoke of my experience under the Treaty of Versailles, in the
                            making of which I had participated.</p>

                        <p>I am wondering whether it would not help the general situation, and ward
                            off undesirable proposals, if we should indicate to the <gloss

                            bring about some positive result in terms of release of US citizens now

                                <p>“I wonder whether it might not be a good idea to notify the
                                    Chinese Communists either through the <gloss target="#t_UK1"

                                    with them about the subject matter.</p>
                                <p>“As you know, I think there is need to do something and I feel
                                    that some direct contacts are less dangerous than the kind of

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said his Government
                            felt it important that the Far Eastern situation should not be brought
                            up “in a big way” at the forthcoming “Summit” conference at Geneva. He
                            hoped we could give the impression there that the matter was being
                            handled “on another <pb n="632" xml:id="pg_632" facs="0660"/>track”. He
                            said he had talked with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1"
                                >Molotov</persName> along this line at San Francisco, and indicated
                            that <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> concurred.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that following his talk with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> on July 1, he had been thinking
                            the matter over, and one idea had occurred to him as a possibility. He
                            wanted to throw this idea out merely as something to talk about, since
                            the United States had reached no firm decision on it. His idea was that
                            the direct contacts now being maintained between United States and Red
                            Chinese representatives on a sporadic and low-level basis at Geneva
                            might be raised to a higher level and the scope of the talks expanded.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he thought Moscow
                            or New Delhi might be a suitable location for such expanded discussions
                            since the Red Chinese had responsible Ambassadors in both places. The
                            Secretary asked what was wrong with Geneva, where the initial contact
                            had already been established. The United States could send someone of
                            higher rank to Geneva for the purpose.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he thought the
                            success of such talks would depend on the subject matter to be
                            discussed. The Secretary responded, in emphatic tones, that he had made
                            it abundantly clear in public declarations as well as in private
                            conversations that the United States would not negotiate behind the back
                            of Formosa. If our position on this point was still not clear to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>, he wished to repeat
                            it again so there could be no doubt on the point or reason for raising
                            it again. He said that there were a number of marginal things which
                            could be discussed if the Red Chinese wanted to talk. For example, the
                            press this morning had spoken of U.S. maneuvers around the Islands of
                                Penghu.<note n="2" xml:id="d288fn2">According to notes of the
                                Secretary’s staff meetings, <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> asked at his July 5 staff meeting whether the

                            general relations between the United States and Red China would have to
                            be discussed sometime. The Secretary agreed, but again emphasized that
                            timing was of the greatest importance. Moreover, he was confused
                            regarding the subjects the Peking authorities wanted to talk about. He
                            had received some information indicating that they did not want to talk
                            with the United States about Formosa since they regarded Formosa as an
                            internal matter. If conversations could be started at Geneva, we would
                            soon find out what they wanted to talk about.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> characterized the
                            Chinese as great compromisers and expressed the opinion that once talks
                            were started, they would be <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0661"
                            />willing to discuss many things. To make the talks fruitful, the
                            question of the Americans in China and Chinese in the United States
                            should be disposed of, in order to create an atmosphere conducive to
                            favorable results. If it should happen that the Red Chinese released the
                            American flyers, he thought the situation would be much better.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary agreed heartily. He could not guarantee that the American
                            public would, even then, be enthusiastic about Red China, but at least a
                            negative force would have been eliminated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked whether it was
                            possible for the Secretary to make a public declaration stating that all
                            Chinese nationals in the United States were free to return to China if
                            they wished. The Secretary said that if direct talks were to be
                            undertaken, he would prefer to reserve such a public declaration until
                            that time. He thought the Chinese Communists themselves might prefer to
                            have any declaration grow out of the talks. He pointed out that the
                            latest complaint we have had from Peking was not that we are holding
                            Chinese in the United States but that we are pushing them back to China.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said this highlighted
                            the need for machinery to handle the question, to satisfy both sides
                            that their nationals were given adequate consular protection. He did not
                            think that higher-level discussions would be adequate until a more
                            favorable basis for them was established.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary asked whether Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> thought the Red Chinese wanted to talk with us
                            directly or through intermediaries. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> thought they were ready to talk directly with us,
                            but he felt confident that in the meanwhile steps towards a relaxation
                            should be taken. He mentioned the questions of prisoners of war and the
                            embargo against trade with Red China were subjects on which progress
                            might be made now.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if all points of disagreement could be disposed
                            of before-hand, direct talks would not be necessary. He emphasized again
                            that if the Peking authorities did not want to talk, his suggestion
                            should be dropped and no more time wasted on it. He asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> once more whether he thought the
                            Chinese wanted to talk with us directly or through intermediaries. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> repeated that he
                            thought they wanted to talk directly, but commented that the level of
                            the officials to carry on the talks would have to be considered. The
                            Secretary said he was quite open-minded on this point and that if the
                            Red Chinese did not like Geneva, some other place could be
                            considered.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> returned to the
                            question of trade embargoes and the American flyers. The Secretary
                            pointed out that there were two kinds of restrictions on trade with Red
                            China, the international restrictions imposed by a number of nations,
                            and an additional embargo which was self-imposed by the United States.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> thought it would <pb
                                n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0662"/>be helpful if trade with China
                            could be placed on the same level as trade with Russia. The Secretary
                            replied that this was already true, in effect, since the trade which the
                            United States voluntarily renounced did not hurt the Chinese Communists,
                            who could buy the commodities from any one else they wished. We were
                            merely losing business to Hong Kong. The only embargo which really hurt
                            the Chinese was the international one.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> reverted to the
                            question of Chinese in the United States, and asked whether the United
                            States position was that they were free to go back to China. The
                            Secretary said that his statement was correct. There might be one or two
                            cases in which some question was still pending, but he did not believe
                            we would insist on holding the individuals involved even in these cases.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> mentioned that the
                            Peking authorities thought that many Chinese in the United States wanted
                            to return to China but were not able to do so. The Secretary said the
                            Red Cross or somebody else could find out whether this was correct.
                            Referring again to the Red Chinese complaint that we are forcing Chinese
                            to leave, he said he would be very happy if the Chinese would
                            reciprocate by putting “pressure” on Americans to get out of China. He
                            thought that if <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> really
                            wanted better relations with the United States, he would release all the
                            Americans in China within twenty-four hours.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> was a reasonable man and
                            wanted good relations with us. The problem was to convince <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> that Americans reciprocated this
                            desire. He asked whether Americans who wanted to visit China would be
                            permitted to do so. (He probably had in mind American journalists but he
                            may also have been thinking of relatives of the flyers.) The Secretary
                            said that he did not think it made much sense for additional Americans
                            to go to China as long as those already there were being held as
                            prisoners. With reference to the Indian offer to assure that Americans
                            visiting China would be treated properly, he said that the United States
                            could not rely on third countries to protect American citizens.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> then asked directly,
                            “Then, there is no likelihood of a relaxation to enable Americans to
                            visit China?” The Secretary said he saw none at the moment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> then said that the only
                            concrete result of his several talks with the Secretary seemed to be the
                            Secretary’s suggestion for a step-up in the level and scope of direct
                            conversations. Was any progress possible on the question of a
                            cease-fire? The Secretary said that the United States had stated many
                            times that it desired a cessation of hostilities and declared that he
                            was not impressed by people who were ready to agree to a cease-fire only
                            if they got what they wanted without firing. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that the shooting and
                            threats of shooting were not only from one side. The Secretary reminded
                                <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0663"/>him that the United States
                            had obtained a commitment from <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang
                                Kai-shek</persName> to avoid initiating hostilities without our
                            consent. He then reenforced his previous statements that the use of
                            force should be renounced by Peking. He had certainly expected India to
                            support this position. He was therefore greatly surprised that Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> seemed to be
                            supporting the Peking thesis, which openly avowed the use of force.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> answered, with
                            considerable emotion “No, no, no! As recently as last week, my Prime
                            Minister even pursuaded the Russians to join in a communiqué in Moscow
                            condemning the use of force in settlement of the Formosa question”.<note

                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said India’s support for Peking
                            extended only to the fact that China should be united. He recalled that
                            India had supported this position when China was governed by <persName
                                corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang Kai-shek</persName>. He declared that he
                            had never said that Peking should take the islands by military action.
                            He added that he was determined, above everything else, not to allow his
                            conversations in San Francisco and Washington to affect United
                            States-Indian relations adversely. He did not want India’s motives to be
                            suspect by either side.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said he had gained the impression that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> thought <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s position was a reasonable one.
                            Yet <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName>’s avowed position was
                            that if he could not get the islands by peaceful means, he would take
                            them by force. If he had misunderstood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName>’s position, he would be glad to be corrected. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> repeated that India
                            had stated, in Moscow of all places, that it was wrong to use force. The
                            Secretary said he was very glad that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> was not endorsing <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName>’s position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he did not wish to
                            see the United States become involved in the Chinese civil war. The
                            Secretary pointed out that Soviet Russia had taken the position that the
                            Korean war was a civil war, but the world knew that it was something
                            much bigger. He said the problem of the unification of China was similar
                            to that of Korea, Germany and Indochina and that the United States
                            opposed the use of force in any of these situations. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> repeated that his Government’s
                            position in opposition to the use of force was well known. The Secretary
                            said he had always thought that was India’s position. He did not believe
                            that India would use force, for example, to take Goa. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said this was entirely correct.
                            The Secretary said, “Then let Red China take the same position regarding
                            Quemoy and Matsu”. He thought that until Peking began to see that there
                                <pb n="636" xml:id="pg_636" facs="0664"/>were moral principles
                            higher than the use of brute force, they would probably not get along
                            with the United States very well.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName>, still excited by the
                            Secretary’s implication that India supported the use of force, declared
                            that in twenty years the United States would recognize the correctness
                            of India’s position in the present discussions. He said his role was not
                            to justify the attitude of either side. The Secretary said he did not
                            doubt in any way whatsoever the Indian Government’s good intentions in
                            undertaking to achieve a settlement. He repeated, however, that the
                            World must be held together by some sense of principle. He remarked that
                            he had fought for economic aid for India on a basis of principle,
                            despite the fact that many people questioned this aid in view of India’s
                            foreign policy. He had also supported aid for Yugoslavia even though, as
                            he had pointed out in San Francisco, the United States Government
                            differed from that of Yugoslav Government in every respect except
                            one—the Yugoslav determination to defend its independence. The principle
                            involved was the democratic one of allowing Governments to differ on
                            foreign policy without affecting the United States attitude on the aid
                            question. The renunciation of the use of force was another high moral
                            principle that civilized nations should adopt.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> asked whether
                            reconciliation was not also a high principle. The Secretary said it was,
                            and that if India could help remove the concept of force from the minds
                            of the Chinese Communists, steps towards reconciliation would be
                            possible. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that
                            India had already used its strong endeavors in this direction. “If you
                            could let us impress Peking”, he added, “that we had access to your
                            mind, we could be more effective”. The Secretary said he had opened
                            every possible recess of his mind to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                >Menon</persName> during their several long conversations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he was leaving for
                            London tomorrow and would like to return to Washington to talk with the
                            Secretary again on July 12 or 13, before the Secretary left for Geneva.
                            The Secretary said he would be able to give very little attention to
                            anything except the Geneva Conference during these days. He remarked
                            that he had spent more time talking with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> during the last three
                            weeks than he had with any other foreign diplomat during a similar
                            period since he had been Secretary of State. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> protested that he was not a
                            diplomat. The Secretary said, smiling, “Well, whatever you call
                            yourself”. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said that
                            in view of the Secretary’s schedule, it probably would be useless for
                            him to return to Washington before Geneva.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> was accompanying
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> to the elevator, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> remarked in a tone of
                            hopelessness, “Your Secretary has said to me in so many words: ‘Go away,
                            you are not serving any useful purpose’”. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> said that the Secretary had given
                            him a <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0665"/>very direct and simple
                            task, which should be easy and agreeable for any Indian to carry out.
                            His task was to persuade the Red Chinese to renounce the use of force.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> said he could not go
                            back to Peking without something more than this in hand.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> informed
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_AGV1">Allen</persName> that he planned to
                            return to Washington July 24.<note n="4" xml:id="d288fn4"><persName

                                for July 14, 1955, states that <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                    >Menon</persName> had visited him twice, in the company of
                                Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName>, “to talk
                                about establishing some basis of mediation between Red China and
                                ourselves. I have bluntly told him, both times, that the American
                                people will not consider using the lives and freedom of their own
                                citizens as a bargaining material. Since Red China, in violation of
                                her solemn word given in the Korean Armistice, unjustly held some of
                                our men prisoners—men that China herself admits were in uniform when
                                captured—we will not make important political concessions on the
                                grounds that this would be recompensed by the return of some of
                                these men. We maintain that China cannot be regarded by us as a
                                civilized nation ready to work with us in good faith until <hi

                                other than the assurance that all Chinese in our country are free to
                                go back to China whenever they may desire. This <persName

                            which I received through your Embassy here under date of the
                            twenty-seventh of June.<note n="2" xml:id="d289fn2">The message from

                                hope that the President had found <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1"
                                    >Krishna Menon</persName>’s report encouraging and that some

                                cause of peace. It further stated that <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                    >Nehru</persName>’s visit to the Soviet Union had convinced him
                                that the Soviet Government sincerely desired peace, that “a marked
                                change had come over Soviet policy … which was not a mere temporary
                                phase”, and that “more than at any other time in the past, there was
                                substantial reason for hoping for peaceful approaches and
                                settlements.” <persName corresp="#p_MGL1">Mehta</persName>’s letter
                                is filed with a letter of July 7 from <persName corresp="#p_DJF1"

                                gets an accurate statement of what we have in mind. <persName

                                >Menon</persName>, after which the Secretary and I had a
                            conversation with him, and I took the occasion to send by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> to you my very cordial
                            greetings. We have followed with interest your travels and statements
                            which you have made in connection therewith, and we know that in these
                            matters you are actuated by high and noble purpose.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the talks which we have had with Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVKK1">Menon</persName> may have served a useful
                            purpose, at least in clarifying our minds. Also we have had talks here
                            with Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>.</p>
                        <p>You will, of course, recall that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> at the Bandung Conference suggested direct talks
                            with the United States with reference to items of tension, and both
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and I responded
                            by saying that we also would be willing to have such talks, provided
                            that we could not deal with the rights of third parties in their
                            absence; but that matters of direct concern to the two of us could be
                            discussed.</p>
                        <p>Since then Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> has
                            reiterated his desire for direct talks, and I am inclined to think that
                            the best step now to take is to explore this course. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> and I are therefore thinking of
                            suggesting that a designated Ambassador of the United States should meet
                            at Geneva with a representative of the Chinese Communist régime of
                            comparable rank with a view to dealing in the first instance with the
                            question of the citizens of each of our countries in the territory of
                            the other who want to return. This topic has, indeed, already been
                            discussed intermittently at Geneva, at the consular level, with some,
                            though meager, results. Further progress in this matter could lead to
                            discussion of other topics which the Chinese Communists might want to
                            suggest and which would be discussable within the limits of the
                            principle which I indicated above.</p>
                        <p>I hope you will feel that such a move would in fact advance the cause of
                            peace in the Far East, as your letter urges.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly interested in hearing of your observations in Russia
                            and the conclusions which you draw from them. I hope indeed that you are
                            right that a marked change has come over Soviet policy and that this is
                            not a merely temporary phase. Certainly as I go to Geneva I will be
                            strengthened and encouraged by your feeling that there is substantial
                            reason for hoping for peaceful applications and solutions.</p>

                                agreement was described in despatch 252 from Taipei (see vol. <hi

                                as follows: “The bargain was more or less struck that the U.S.
                                military authorities would agree to the formation of nine reserve
                                divisions, to train on a one-month basis per year, with the
                                understanding that the personnel of the various non-supported units
                                was to be transferred to these nine reserve divisions, so that the
                                non-supported units would, in fact, disappear. The United States was
                                to furnish training equipment for one division. These
                                recommendations were subject to higher approval in Washington, as
                                was made clear not only in the talks themselves but also in a
                                personal letter from Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_RKL1"

                            a reserve program in principle, the plan submitted from Taipei to
                            Defense was inadequate in several respects. As submitted, the plan could
                            and probably would be construed by the Chinese as committing the United
                            States to equip nine “reserve” divisions in addition to the twenty-one
                            now supported by us. These nine divisions would tie down much costly
                            equipment. An indication that the Chinese are thinking in terms of
                            standing forces rather than a genuine reserve training program is

                                        would be wise to leave them alone. It would also, of course,

                                as you apparently do, to get something under way soon, as suggested,
                                so that it will be in the works before we get to Geneva and, as you
                                suggest, will provide the best answer to the Russians, as your June

                            me after <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had left Chequers
                            for Windsor. However, in the course of our long talk on Saturday
                            morning, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had shown us the
                            President’s letter<note n="3" xml:id="d292fn3">Transmitted in <ref
                                    target="#d289">Document 289</ref>.</note> and we had discussed
                            the proposal at some length. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> was obviously pleased and flattered by the
                            gracious <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0670"/>terms of the letter,
                            but he seemed himself doubtful whether <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou
                                En-lai</persName> would regard the scope of the proposed talks as
                            quite wide enough to achieve your purpose. <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> felt that your suggestion only raised the level of
                            the talks now going on, without extending their scope. We argued
                            strongly that this was a new move and ought to be welcomed as such. But
                            of course not having received your message and thinking from the
                            President’s letter that you meant to use <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> as intermediary, we did not press the argument
                            with full vigour, although we made our position quite clear. Thinking
                            over our discussion and knowing something of the legalism and
                            hair-splitting of the oriental mind, I feel that perhaps the formula as
                            phrased is rather too rigid. Of course it is obviously right to bar any
                            discussion of Formosa and its future. The question of “citizens of each
                            of our countries …<note n="4" xml:id="d292fn4">Ellipsis in the source
                                text.</note> who want to return” is clearly the first point for
                            discussion but if all went well on this presumably you would wish the
                            talks to go on to other matters, such as cessation of attacks on
                            shipping, peaceful use of the seas and various other matters connected
                            with “reduction of tension”. You indeed suggest this, but I feel that
                            the restrictive formula, which is obviously right for the great issues,
                            such as the future of Formosa, might be phrased in a way that will at
                            least allow some fairly general and perhaps useful conversations without
                            prejudice to your obligations to <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> and the Nationalists. It is not easy to think of
                            “other topics” to reduce tension in this part of the world, which would
                            not have at least an indirect bearing on the rights of third parties.
                            Your ingenuity may be able to suggest a formula which might open up
                            useful talks without prejudice to your obligations.</p>

                                    <p>“Your and our consular representatives at Geneva have been
                                        having intermittent talks during the past year regarding the
                                        repatriation of civilians who desire to return to their
                                        respective countries. The results have been disappointing to
                                        us. It has been suggested that it would aid in settling this
                                        matter if these talks were conducted on a more authoritative
                                        level, and that this could facilitate further discussion and
                                        settlement of certain other practical matters now at issue
                                        between the two of us. If you think well of this, we will
                                        designate a representative of ambassadorial rank to meet on
                                        the above basis with your representative of comparable rank

                                formula dealing with scope of possible conversations. We have
                                omitted any express reference to the proviso in President’s letter
                                to <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> that “we could not
                                deal with the rights of third parties in their absence”. We leave
                                this thought implicit in the phrase “practical matters now at issue
                                between the two of us” in the hope that this treatment will give a
                                lesser impression of rigidity.</item>

                                    cordial message and I am glad that the talks <persName
                                        corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName> had with you and

                                    served a useful purpose. I am now on my way back to India and I
                                    hope to send you a fuller reply from Delhi.</p>
                                <p>There is one point, however, to which I would venture to draw
                                    your attention. You have been good enough to inform me that you
                                    and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> are
                                    thinking of appointing a designated Ambassador of the United
                                    States to meet at Geneva with a representative of the Chinese
                                    Communist regime of comparable rank with a view to dealing, in
                                    the first instance, with the question of citizens of each of the
                                    two countries in the territory of the other who want to return.
                                    As you have stated, this topic has already been discussed at
                                    Geneva at the consular level. But the results so far obtained
                                    have been meagre. It would certainly be better for these
                                    discussions to take place at a higher level. But it is doubtful
                                    if any further results are likely to be obtained by merely
                                    raising the status of the representatives on either side. It has
                                    been the hope and the intention of your government, as of other
                                    governments, to lessen tension in the Far East progressively so
                                    that this might lead to a better atmosphere for negotiations in
                                    some form or other. Fortunately there has been a lull in the Far
                                    East and practically a cease-fire. To take advantage of this
                                    position and to further it in the right direction, I would
                                    venture to suggest that some further step is desirable.</p>
                                <p>Premier <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                                    mentioned to us some little time ago that negotiations through
                                    diplomatic representatives as at Geneva had <pb n="645"
                                        xml:id="pg_645" facs="0673"/>served little purpose. It would
                                    not be helpful if he is led to believe that nothing further is
                                    intended now than raise the status of diplomatic representatives
                                    at Geneva and to discuss only the question of detained
                                    nationals. The possible further progress to which you have
                                    referred in your letter might actually be impeded.</p>
                                <p>You have referred to certain limitations under which discussions
                                    should take place. I would submit that even within those
                                    limitations it might be possible to discuss other issues. I am
                                    not suggesting that any solution will be found at this stage by
                                    these talks. But you will no doubt agree that it is important to
                                    maintain, if not to improve, the present lower tensions in the
                                    Far East and thus prevent a conflict arising in respect of the
                                    coastal islands.</p>
                                <p>Because of the apprehension I feel in this matter, I am taking
                                    the liberty of drawing your attention to this aspect in the hope
                                    that this whole matter will receive further and fuller
                                    consideration by you before any definite step is taken.</p>
                                <p>Thanking you again and with my regards, I am, Mr. President,
                                    Sincerely yours, <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Jawaharlal

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s message points up the
                            difficulty we will encounter in finding topics for conversation with the
                            Chinese Communists going beyond the prisoner and Chinese student
                            questions. It is difficult to think of any additional topics which might
                            be fruitful and do not either directly involve the rights and essential
                            interests of the Chinese Nationalists or else open a Pandora’s box.</p>
                        <p>The matter of the seizure of American Government and commercial
                            properties on the China mainland might be broached, but this would give
                            the Chinese Communists a good platform from which to launch an attack on
                            our Foreign Assets Control regulations, and the trade embargo.
                            Furthermore, it might seem a prelude to possible diplomatic recognition.
                            We might demand an accounting for the death in prison of several
                            American missionaries who were probably murdered by the Chinese
                            Communists, including the Presbyterian medical missionary, Dr. Wallace,
                            in 1951 and Catholic Bishop Ford in 1953,<note n="3" xml:id="d298fn3"
                                >Dr. William L. Wallace died in prison in February 1951; Bishop
                                Francis X. Ford died in prison in February 1952.</note> and other
                            outrages perpetrated against American citizens. But this would not be
                            helpful in this context, and would be more calculated to exacerbate than
                            to relieve tensions.</p>
                        <p>The British have suggested that a later topic of discussion could be the
                            “cessation of attacks on shipping” and “peaceful use of the seas”. The
                            British have an axe to grind in bringing up these topics, in that they
                            are now arguing with the Chinese Nationalists over interception of
                            British vessels trading with south China ports, and in connection with
                            Chinese Nationalist mining of the territorial waters of the off-shore
                            islands.</p>
                        <p>The British undoubtedly hope to get us to induce the Chinese Nationalists
                            to terminate their blockade and “port closure” attempts. It is
                            questionable whether we should take action which would estop the Chinese
                            Nationalists from interfering with the supply by sea of the mainland
                            bases opposite Taiwan and the off-shore islands. Hence, while we do not
                            officially support the Nationalists’ interdiction efforts, we should not
                            become involved in bilateral talks with the Chinese Communists on this
                            subject.</p>
                        <pb n="649" xml:id="pg_649" facs="0677"/>
                        <p>I am inclined to think that the best fall-back topic for us to suggest is
                            simply the renunciation of force by the Chinese Communists in the entire
                            area of the Taiwan Strait. This could be taken up concurrently with the
                            prisoner and student questions. With our established desire to avoid the
                            use of force and to urge a policy of restraint on the Chinese
                            Nationalists under the exchange of notes of December 10, we are on sound
                            ground in insisting upon a like restraint on the part of the Chinese
                            Communists. If this topic were urged upon the Chinese Communists, they
                            would be on the defensive in rejecting it, as they would probably feel
                            compelled to do.</p>
                        <p>It is highly unlikely that the release of all the Americans, military and
                            civilian, held by the Chinese Communists will materialize in the near
                            future or that they will agree to a renunciation of the use of force
                            with maintenance of the status quo in the area of the Taiwan Straits.
                            Such being the case, we would have good ground for refusing to discuss
                            other topics until these are settled. We need not accept <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>’s argument that our formula is
                            too restrictive. We could take the position as to other topics that we
                            will cross that bridge when we get to it. In the meanwhile I suggest
                            that we be careful to avoid any indication that we think there is a wide
                            range of marginal questions or questions not involving the essential
                            interests of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> which might
                            fruitfully be discussed. Insofar as I can see, there is no wide range of
                            such questions which could be taken up with profit to ourselves at this
                            time.</p>

                            <item>Talks between US and Chinese consular representatives at Geneva
                                had from the beginning been confined to question of Chinese
                                nationals in US and US nationals in China, and exchange of
                                information about them. Chinese side had provided information about
                                US nationals in China. US now admitted disappointment over results
                                of these talks. Chinese had, however, far more reasons express
                                disappointment; they had not been given definite information on
                                question of Chinese students in US.</item>

                            <item>For this reason the Chinese had suggested to <persName

                                    >UK</gloss> would act for US in Peiping in matter of US
                                nationals in China, and another country such as India would
                                similarly act for Chinese in Washington in the matter of the Chinese
                                nationals in US. <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> recalled
                                that some years ago US had proposed that <gloss target="#t_HMG1"
                                    >HMG</gloss> should look after US interests in China, but
                                circumstances at that time were different and Chinese had not
                                responded and that year ago at Geneva Chinese had proposed that
                                third party should look after Chinese interests in US but on that
                                occasion US had not responded. It seemed to him that proposal he had
                                made to <persName corresp="#p_MVKK1">Krishna Menon</persName>, which
                                latter had probably mentioned in London, was more practical and
                                helpful than that now made in US communication.</item>

                            <item>He undertook not to publish US communication before the Chinese

                        <p>Since <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s remark seemed
                            to indicate that he regarded American proposal as confined only to
                            question of US nationals in China and Chinese nationals in US, <persName
                                corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> drew his attention to third

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> added that he would report

                            reply to US communication. If, after necessary study, he wished make any

                                >O’Neill</persName> no doubt he would send for him. <persName

                                Bedell Smith, made at Geneva in the Eighth Plenary Session of the

                            will recall that we discussed this during my visit to Washington. The
                            message then refers to the fact that consultations had not yet begun
                            with a view to making preparations for the General Elections to be held
                            in Vietnam in July 1956, although the Geneva Agreement required that
                            such consultations and preparations should begin in July 1955. It adds
                            that the release of the four American pilots did not seem to have
                            contributed to relaxation of tensions; rather it was Premier <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>’s impression that China’s
                            action in releasing these pilots had been interpreted as a sign of
                            weakness. Indeed, his message carried the insinuation that the hope
                            which I had expressed at Bandung to the effect that the release of the
                            air-men would bring about a reduction of tensions had not been
                            fulfilled. Premier <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            further complained that Kuomintang harassment of the Chinese coast had
                            been on the increase recently.</p>
                        <p>As I said in opening this letter, China’s attitude in general as
                            reflected in this message is causing me considerable concern. It seems
                            to me that we just cannot let the situation drift, and that we need to
                            do something to check the threatened deterioration in the situation in
                            the Far East.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly concerned with the situation in Cambodia and Laos, for
                            reasons which are well known to you. The recent reports in the
                            newspapers of the renewal of fighting in Northern Laos have done nothing
                            to allay my concern. I am anxious that something be done immediately to
                            prevent a worsening of the situation in these countries. I have given
                            the matter much anxious thought, and have been forced to fall back on my
                            former conclusion, which is that the <pb n="652" xml:id="pg_652"
                                facs="0680"/>only way to arrest the drift is for discussions to take
                            place, at the highest possible level, between the United States and
                            China as soon as possible. I do hope that you will use all your
                            influence to bring about such discussions. I personally do not believe
                            that there is any danger that Asia, and for that matter the whole world,
                            would regard United States agreement to enter into discussions with
                            China as evidence of weakness since no man in his senses today could
                            possibly regard America as weak. On the contrary, I sincerely believe
                            that it would be regarded as a magnanimous act.</p>
                        <p>It may be that it would be advantageous to bring some other countries
                            into the discussions. In that event, Cambodia, Laos, France and India
                            would seem to be appropriate—the first two for obvious reasons, France
                            because of her continuing interest in Cambodia and Laos, and India
                            because of her role under the terms of the Geneva Agreement. But of
                            course the question of which, if any, of these countries should be
                            invited is something which must be left entirely to the United States
                            and China to decide.</p>
                        <p>I should be glad to know your reaction to this suggestion. In view of the
                            urgency and importance of this matter, I am trying to ensure that this
                            letter reaches you before you leave for Geneva. As you know, we are
                            strictly “peace brokers” in this matter. We want peace because we abhor
                            war with all its sacrifice in blood and treasure, and because peace is a
                            pre-requisite to the amelieration of the conditions in which live so
                            large a proportion of the world’s population. It is this, and this
                            alone, which prompts me to address this letter to you.<note n="3"

                                advance because it seemed to limit the scope of discussion to the
                                release of nationals and because it would apparently cut off the

                                expressed concern that the Chinese might turn to the use of force if

                        <p>In the course of another conversation with the President this afternoon,
                            the Acting Secretary informed him that we had just received a message
                            relayed through the British Foreign Office to the effect that <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> had accepted our proposal to
                            conduct further negotiations in Geneva at the Ambassadorial level. The
                            Chinese have proposed that the first meeting be held on July 21. They
                            have also confirmed that there should be no publicity until mutual
                            agreement on the question had been reached between the U.S. and Chinese
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed great interest in this message but felt it might
                            create serious complications if these bilateral U.S.-Chinese Communist
                            discussions were to commence during the meeting of the Heads of
                            Government. After further discussion of this point, the President and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> agreed that the
                            earliest practicable date would be July 25 and that we should stall the
                            Chinese Communist on some such grounds as our inability to get our
                            representative to Geneva earlier than this.</p>

                        <p>Recently my government has received many letters from our students in US
                            and their families. These letters show many Chinese students in US have
                            been notified by your emigration authorities they must leave US by
                            September 6, 1955. These notifications threaten our students with arrest
                            if they do not leave your country by that date. If they do not leave by
                            that date they are to appear before your authorities. This action is
                            arbitrary and does not facilitate departure our students. On the
                            contrary it causes hardship and does not give them sufficient time to
                            make their travel plans. This is because many students do not have funds
                            to purchase transportation home before September 6 and consequently if
                            they do not leave at their expense <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657"
                                facs="0685"/>before that date they will be arrested. This is harsh
                            maneuver of your government and pretext for the arrest of our students
                            and to cause them grave hardship. Over one year has elapsed since first
                            Geneva meetings with your side started. We have always opposed
                            unreasonable actions of your government towards our students, the ill
                            treatment they have suffered and brutal and senseless way in which many
                            of them have been arrested and detained. These actions of your
                            government ignore our protests and are unreasonable. My side wishes to
                            stress once more our students are in the US to study, that they have
                            committed no crimes and that they should all be free to return to their
                            homeland whenever they wish to do so. Your government must not mistreat
                            them nor arrest and detain them nor limit time within which they should
                            depart. Fact your government has deprived these students right to return
                            their homeland to rejoin their families is contrary all humane
                            principles and contrary to legal rights our people to return home. This
                            conduct of your government has caused most profound indignation of our
                            students, their families and the people our entire country. In the name
                            of my government I hereby register solemn protest against treatment
                            extended our students in your country as I have just explained.</p>
                        <p>Regarding Americans in China we always protect those who respect our
                            laws. On condition they settle their personal debts many Americans in
                            China can apply for exit permits. This we have previously explained to
                            you. My government has always done its best to relieve tension and our
                            efforts that effect are well known by entire world. However, to relieve
                            tension it is necessary for both sides to cooperate. Therefore, we
                            request American Government cease all action limiting time within which
                            our students should leave US. Your government should also refrain from

                            arrangements and carry them out before September 6. Your government must
                            not in any case ill treat our students who wish to go home and join
                            their families.</p>
                        <p>I have noted what you said about Sister Theresa. Her case will be brought
                            attention my government.</p>
                        <p>I replied I would report my government what <persName corresp="#p_SP1"
                                >Shen</persName> had said and that such reply as my government might
                            wish to make would be communicated to him in due course. I again took
                            occasion to emphasize how very well and generously Chinese students in
                            US are treated that they are free to depart if they wish to do so, that
                            some have elected of their own free will to remain in the US while
                            others have elected to leave the US but not to return to Communist
                            China. (I was guided by your 828<note n="5" xml:id="d304fn5">See <ref

                            appropriate.) I said with very few exceptions <pb n="658"
                                xml:id="pg_658" facs="0686"/>no adequate news had been received as
                            to welfare and whereabouts of Americans in Communist China, that
                            families have received no letters and that very many Americans in China
                            have likewise received no communications from their families. I sharply
                            contrasted very fine and generous way in which we have treated Chinese
                            students in US with way Americans have been treated in Communist China.
                            I again emphatically expressed hope every effort would be made by
                                <persName corresp="#p_SP1">Shen</persName>’s side to effect early
                            repatriation all Americans in Red China and that prompt complete

                            and addresses these Americans and exact nature and amount in each case
                            alleged unsettled personal debts. I said our side prepared furnish

                            emphatically stressed all Department had previously instructed me to say
                            with regard our people in Communist China. I impressed upon <persName

                            soon for us. In view of preoccupations with reference to Geneva, we
                            cannot designate and instruct our representative and get him to Geneva

                            alarmed that this was going to lead into real conflict and stated that
                                <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0690"/>it would create a terrible

                            China on this issue. He said the British government would always hope to
                            be on the American side in every quarrel. This is their fixed and firm
                            policy. But the British people as a whole look on the offshore islands
                            as belonging to Red China, and consider that we are foolish to be
                            supporting <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> even indirectly
                            in possession of those areas.</p>
                        <p>I tried to explain the United States position to <persName

                            to these islands as “symbols” to his own forces. Since <persName
                                corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> agrees that we cannot afford to
                            give up Formosa, he had no trouble understanding the importance of

                            Formosa. I also brought out the importance of <persName

                            felt that another single backward step in the region would have the
                            gravest effects on all of our Chinese friends.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I outlined to him the attitude we had taken and the efforts we
                            had made in attempting to get <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"
                                >Chiang</persName> to be somewhat more flexible with respect to
                            those islands. I told him why we sent <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> out to the region and how earnestly we hoped
                            that <persName corresp="#p_CKG1">Chiang</persName> would not only change
                            his pronouncements concerning the indispensability of the islands and,

                            to agree to this proposal. But it must be pointed out that contact

                            “rigamarole” and quoted <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">ChiCom</gloss>s on
                            following points: (1) Chinese Communists noted there had been no
                            reciprocation by United States after release of four US prisoners; (2)
                            referred to Chinese students stating date fixed by US for students
                            decision return Communist China was limited and therefore US statements
                            regarding their freedom to return had no practical meaning; (3)
                            complained Hammarskjoeld’s activities saying they appeared to be
                            threats. At last point <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName>

                                            reached the conclusion that the U.S. Government feared
                                            that China after release of the prisoners would continue
                                            to take other steps in order to lessen the tension. Such
                                            a development would not be welcomed by the United

                                                  pressure against China. The American intentions
                                                  obviously aimed at stirring up Chinese public

                                                  released, propaganda would be made to the effect

                                            message of 2 July had presented a new example of
                                            pressure. To make a report on the prisoners issue to the
                                            United Nations, which had illegally deprived China of
                                            its seat, would not have this effect on China. If a
                                            contribution to the relaxation of tension was intended,
                                            it would not be right to exert pressure through the
                                            United Nations. China would certainly not yield to any
                                            pressure. The Chinese authorities would follow its own
                                            rules and be led by its own judgment as to what would
                                            best serve the purpose of lessening the tension. The
                                            pressure policy of the United States was borne out by
                                            the American military provocations and manoeuvres in the
                                            Formosa Straits which aimed at intimidation.</p>

                                            had been in Peking and it ought to be clear to him that
                                            China conducted a peaceful policy. The Chinese
                                            Government had announced its wish to negotiate with the
                                            United States, which country had demonstrated the
                                            greatest antagonism against China. It had not been China
                                            that had taken an ambiguous position. It was now for the
                                            United States to show a spirit of conciliation, which
                                            would not be rejected. However, the attitude taken by
                                            the United States at present could not lead to a
                                            relaxation of the tension.</p>

                                <p>“I received on 9 July 1955 from the Swedish Ambassador in Peking
                                    an account of your recent talk with him. Your willingness to
                                    continue our discussions on the basis of the friendly attitude,
                                    which inspired our talks in Peking as well as our subsequuent
                                    contacts in the course of the spring, is fully shared by me.</p>
                                <p>The central point of my letter of 2 June was my question what—if
                                    anything—I could do in order to facilitate a solution of the
                                    prisoner problem. In that letter and in my most recent message I
                                    tried to give you, with great frankness, my personal reasons for
                                    feeling with growing urgency my responsibility under the Charter
                                    to contribute to <pb n="666" xml:id="pg_666" facs="0694"/>a
                                    relaxation of tensions by doing what I can along the line
                                    indicated by my question.</p>
                                <p>The basis on which I approach this problem remains in all
                                    respects the same as it was in Peking. Although I act in my own
                                    right in my contacts with you and although I recognize that you
                                    reject the General Assembly resolution on the prisoners, this
                                    resolution—as noted also in the course of the Peking
                                    talks—necessarily has binding force on me as concerns the
                                    relationship between the General Assembly and the
                                    Secretary-General. In this context that relationship constitutes
                                    the only basis for an element of pressure which is a pressure on
                                    me as an officer of the organization, explained by the fact that
                                    I have a formal duty towards the General Assembly to account for
                                    my activities.</p>
                                <p>I have given serious consideration to your comments on the
                                    present situation. My interpretation of the attitude of the
                                    United States authorities differs from yours. This difference of
                                    opinion between us, however, should be considered rather as a
                                    reason to continue our discussions than as an obstacle to
                                    further contacts which in my view represent a bridge to which
                                    there is no equivalent.</p>
                                <p>As I shall remain in Geneva, where I arrived yesterday, until the
                                    end of next week and I intend to be back here at the beginning
                                    of August, the Consulate General of the Peoples Republic of
                                    China in Geneva may, during that time, present the simplest line
                                    of communication between us.”</p>

                                    considerable indignation. The Americans were unreasonable in
                                    seeking to use this word; he meant, of course, their rulers, not
                                    the <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0695"/>American people.
                                    Peking had been known as Peking for hundreds of years. Why
                                    should Americans seek to impose their will on other people in
                                    this matter? He thought the British, as a matter of courtesy,
                                    should have declined even to transmit a proposal for using this
                                    word to the Chinese Government.</p>
                                <p>I replied that the word the Americans proposed to describe this
                                    town was the name which has been current in America of it. They
                                    were not seeking to impose use of this word on anyone but
                                    themselves. They did not expect the Chinese Government to use
                                    the word ‘Peiping’ in any English text or statement they might
                                    issue.</p>
                                <p><persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName> continued to
                                    complain, saying that though China had no monarchy they always
                                    described the British Government as Her Majesty’s Government. I
                                    pointed out that these two Governments recognized and were in
                                    relation to each other.</p>
                                <p>After a good deal more grumbling, and after I had pointed out
                                    other changes in the new American text, <persName

                                    are being made to cause the Chinese Communists to accept tacitly

                                    their claims respecting Taiwan. However, even should these
                                    efforts succeed, the security of Taiwan will continue to depend
                                    upon the United States determination to commit its own forces to
                                    the defense of Taiwan. Short of military attack, the Chinese
                                    Communists will continue their efforts to bring about the fall
                                    of Taiwan through the subversion or defection of the
                                    Nationalists, but these efforts are not likely to succeed in the

                                    Chinese regime are rendered more difficult by the growing
                                    international prestige of the Peiping regime, declining faith
                                    (particularly among the overseas Chinese) in the possibility of
                                    a Nationalist return to the mainland, and the growth of
                                    influences making for stagnation of the forces on Taiwan.
                                    Despite a heightened recognition among free world nations of the
                                    strategic importance of Taiwan, there is a discernible trend
                                    towards disregard of the importance of the <gloss
                                        target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> as a political entity. To a
                                    considerable extent the widespread desire for peace in the Far
                                    East has been mobilized behind unrealistic demands for
                                    concessions, all at the expense of the Nationalists—the
                                    abandonment of Nationalist-held off-shore islands, the admission
                                    of Communist China to the United Nations, or even the
                                    institution of a United Nations trusteeship over Taiwan. Until
                                    recently Communist China’s all-or-none attitude and its
                                    insistence upon the purely domestic character of the Taiwan
                                    issue had prevented it from deriving much benefit from these
                                    popular demands. Since the Bandung Conference, however, there
                                    have been signs that a more flexible tactical approach is in the
                                    making. The possibility is thus raised that Communist China
                                    might take the tack of expediency, heading for the eventual
                                    destruction of the <gloss target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> and the
                                    “peaceful liberation” of Taiwan via temporary furtherance of the
                                    “two Chinas” concept. Such a tack would not rule out local
                                    actions against the off-shore islands, however, and the

                        <p>At dinner, I discussed with <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Marshal
                                Bulganin</persName> a number of matters about China. He spoke of his
                            visit there with Krushchev a year ago and made some comments about the
                            economics in the country. He said he thought we should get in touch with
                            the Chinese Peoples Government. I said that we had already taken steps
                            toward doing so but they had apparently bogged down because the Chinese
                            thought we had misspelled the word “Peiping”. We had quite a little
                            discussion about that, and <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                >Bulganin</persName> was obviously ignorant of the significance
                            which the Chinese Communists apparently attach to the spelling. He asked
                            whether we would talk just about the nationals on both sides or whether
                            talks could be broader. I said we expected first to talk about the
                            nationals but we had not excluded some broadening of the talks. However,
                            I said do not expect much very fast. I mentioned to <persName
                                corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> that it had been 17 years
                            before the United States recognized the Soviet Union, and I also asked
                            whether there had not also been a long period of time when the Soviet
                            Union did not recognize the Swiss Republic. He admitted this was so.</p>
                        <p>I spoke of the large amount of aid that Russia was apparently giving to
                            China. He said they were giving a good deal of economic <pb n="671"
                                xml:id="pg_671" facs="0699"/>aid to help them industrialize. I said:
                            you were also giving a lot of military aid. He said: we were doing that,
                            but we had now stopped. I said China is full of MIGs. He said: we are
                            not giving them MIGs any more. We find the more we give them, the more
                            they want. I repeated my inquiries so as to be sure there was no
                            misunderstanding, and again got a categorical statement that they were
                            no longer supplying direct military aid.</p>
                        <p>Later after dinner, <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Marshal
                                Bulganin</persName>, Prime Minister <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName>
                            and I sat together and resumed talking about China. We referred to the
                            spelling matter, and no one of the group seemed to know what it was all
                            about. Someone suggested that perhaps “Peiping” had been the spelling
                            given by the Japanese.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName> said he would look into
                            the situation right away, as he was greatly interested in the matter and
                            wanted talks to get started.</p>
                        <p>I spoke to <persName corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> about the
                            release of the <hi rend="italic">Tuapse</hi> crew. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MVM1">Molotov</persName> said he knew about the plans
                            and that some were supposed to come to the United States. He said this
                            would make a very bad impression in the Soviet Union. I said that I had
                            worked very hard on this matter since he had talked to me in San
                            Francisco and that I understood about 30 were going back to Russia. He
                            said the number was 29. In reply to his statement that it would make a
                            very bad impression that some were going to the United States, I said
                            that it had made a bad impression when some American <gloss
                                target="#t_POW1">POW</gloss>s had decided to go to Communist China,
                            but that these were things one had to accept.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that he would like to
                            discuss the China situation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary recalled that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                            >Chicom</gloss>s had not yet agreed to the Geneva meeting. Their stated
                            objection was the use of the word “Peiping” in the communication, which
                            seemed out of proportion; perhaps it indicated that they had changed
                            their minds. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said their
                            acceptance might have been to get to Geneva when the Conference was in
                            session, and when the date was put after its adjournment, they might
                            have decided not to go ahead.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary explained the US position. The offshore island situation
                            was serious. The <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s were
                            building up positions, and threatening to take the islands by force. The
                            US had been attempting to pacify the situation by influencing the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s not to be provocative.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said the President had
                            expressed the view that it was not wise to build up forces on the
                            islands so that they assumed a prestige aspect, but they should be
                            placed more in the position of outposts. The Secretary said this was so
                            and the US had tried to convince the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1"
                                >Chinat</gloss>s of the wisdom of not continuing to build up the
                            islands, so as to make their holding a matter of importance and
                            prestige. Assistant Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> had gone to Taipei to urge this but with
                            negative results.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said the situation in China was no different than in other
                            countries that were divided, like Germany and Korea, where no attempt
                            was being made to use armed force. Time would be necessary to bring a
                            solution. Many things could happen with the passage of time. Those who
                            had influence with the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s should
                            point this out and the danger of attempting to force the matter by
                            military means. Others do not resort to force, why should the
                            Communists? “Because they have the means”, <persName corresp="#p_ESA1"
                                >Eden</persName> remarked.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> asked if the offshore
                            islands were attacked, would the U.S. intervene. The Secretary said this
                            could not be answered categorically. If they were overrun in 48 hours,
                            the U.S. would not have time to act. However, if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s made a heroic defense and held
                            out, public opinion for intervention would build up and might well get
                            to the point where action by the U.S. would follow. U.S. reaction was
                            strong about Dien Bien Phu where U.S. interests were not nearly so
                            great. Those islands might well be considered by the U.S. people as a
                            symbol, somewhat like Berlin was considered when blockaded.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that if the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s
                            wanted to make progress, they should act like civilized people, that
                            their attempts by pressure and violence to achieve their ends was the
                            wrong way to go about it so far as the American people were concerned.
                            When <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1">Nehru</persName> had suggested there
                            should be some quid pro quo for the release of the prisoners, the
                            Secretary had pointed out that this was like paying a <pb n="673"
                                xml:id="pg_673" facs="0701"/>kidnapper and would have a very bad
                            effect on the American public view of the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >Chicom</gloss>s. Both <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> agreed with
                            this.</p>
                        <p>The question was raised as to what had become of the Soviet suggestion
                            for Six-Power Talks to include the Big Four, the Chinese Communists and
                            India. <persName corresp="#p_ESA1">Eden</persName> said that he thought
                            this had been dropped, because when <persName corresp="#p_NPJ1"
                                >Nehru</persName> was in Moscow and the Soviets brought the matter
                            up, he had said that he did not think well of it.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary told of <persName corresp="#p_NU1">U Nu</persName>’s
                                statement<note n="2" xml:id="d314fn2">See <ref target="#d282"
                                    >Documents 282</ref> and <ref target="#d286">286</ref>.</note>
                            that the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1">Chicom</gloss>s desired direct
                            negotiations with the U.S. on matters affecting the U.S. and direct
                            negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s on
                            matters affecting the <gloss target="#t_ChiNat1">Chinat</gloss>s. He was
                            not sure that this correctly represented the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >Chicom</gloss>’s view, although there had been some rumors to this
                            effect. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said it was
                            quite possible, and he also had heard such rumors. This was the way
                            deals were made in the old days, and the <gloss target="#t_ChiCom1"
                                >Chicom</gloss>s would make <persName corresp="#p_CKG1"

                        <p>The President said he had one more point to raise before the conclusion
                            of the interview, though he felt sure the <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                >Marshal</persName> was as busy as he was. He said he was convinced
                            the Soviet Government wants peace just as we do, and did not wish to
                            have any wars, big or little. He said that among the problems were those
                            of divided countries—that they had been able to settle Austria, the
                            fighting had been ended in Korea and Indochina, and there were hopes for
                            some progress on the German question. There was also the problem of a
                            divided China, and in regard to that he wished to ask only that the
                            Soviet Government should use its influence with the Chinese in order to
                            persuade them that problems should not be settled by fighting. These
                            problems take time and might be long in settling, but since we had
                            settled Austria, Korea, and Indochina, it was important that the Chinese
                            not do something which all would subsequently regret. He said he did not
                            suggest that the Soviet Government was responsible, but was merely
                            asking it to use its good offices to that end. Zhukov said he agreed and
                            held similar views. He said insofar as he was aware the Chinese had no
                            intention to have recourse to armed force. They had been waiting
                            patiently for settlement of these matters and if some hope could be
                            given them there was no doubt that they would continue to wait with
                            patience. He felt that the initiation of direct conversations between
                            the United States and China, possibly at first on minor matters and then
                            later on larger questions, would give such hope. The President said we
                            were not averse to such talks but that the <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1"
                                >Marshal</persName> should understand that the United States was
                            very angry at the fact that the Chinese were still holding soldiers from
                            the Korean War prisoner, but that he did not reject the idea that there
                            might be some hope in negotiation.<note n="2" xml:id="d315fn2">In a
                                conversation with Marshal Zhukov on July 20, the President raised
                                the subject of the American prisoners in China and asked Zhukov to
                                do what he could to bring about their release. Zhukov raised the
                                questions of <gloss target="#t_UN1">U.N.</gloss> membership, the
                                offshore islands, and Taiwan, commenting that delay in settling
                                these questions was not advantageous even to the United States. The
                                President replied that the matter was extremely complicated but
                                pointed out that “in spite of extreme provocation, he had restrained
                                    [<hi rend="italic">refrained</hi>] from sending powerful forces
                                to the area since there was no desire to become involved in war in

                                <p><persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> reported he
                                    explained reasons why US prefers “Peiping” stating it was a real

                                    on this point out of any desire of ill will or intention insult
                                    Chinese. Vice Minister was obdurate and repeated it was absurd

                                <p><persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> then suggested our

                                    enough since the announcement would be issued from Washington
                                    and Peking. Vice Minister said proposal would be considered, but
                                    he hoped first to hear US reactions to his latest proposals.</p>
                                <p><persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> told him he would

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Joy</persName> telephoned me at 1:10 p.m. to report that
                            the Embassy had just received a message from the British Chargé at
                            Peiping. He quoted the message as stating that the Chargé (<persName
                                corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName>) had seen the Chinese Communist
                            Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs on the morning of July 24 local time
                            and delivered the latest US message.<note n="2" xml:id="d317fn2">The

                            that he was certain that the message referred to was the one sent from
                            Geneva. <persName corresp="#p_ONC1">O’Neill</persName> reported that the
                            Vice Minister rejected the compromise version suggested by the US which
                            omitted reference by name to either party. <persName corresp="#p_ONC1"
                                >O’Neill</persName> said he then put forward the second US
                            suggestion which named the two countries involved. The Vice Minister
                            stated that he would refer the proposal to the Foreign Minister
                            immediately and communicate with the Chargé later in the day. The Vice
                            Minister recognized that it was too late to release an announcement on
                            July 24. He thought that there would be sufficient time for the release
                            to be made at both places on July 25 at 1400 <gloss target="#t_GMT1"
                                >GMT</gloss>. The Vice Minister told the Chargé that his government
                            would mention the Chinese People’s Republic first, and he assumed that
                            the US government would mention the United States first.</p>

                            thought that a message to this effect might come through at any

                            prejudice the rights of our ally, the Republic of China.” The Secretary
                            referred to United States concern with the American civilians detained
                            in China and interest in reinforcing the United Nations efforts to bring
                            about the return of the American flyers, but, he continued, <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Of course, the basic thing is that which I pointed out in my
                                    press conference of April 26, namely, ‘whether we must prepare
                                    for war in that area or whether there is apt to be a cease-fire
                                    in the area.’</p>
                                <p>“The United States believes that whatever may be the differences
                                    which now divide countries, these differences should not be
                                    settled by recourse to force where this would be apt to provoke
                                    international war. The United States has itself consistently
                                    acted on that belief. Wherever we give any military assistance,
                                    it is under the explicit condition that it will not be used for
                                    aggressive purposes. There is no doubt but what East Germany is
                                    part of Germany, but Chancellor Adenauer has given solemn
                                    assurance that he will not use force to unite his country. There
                                    is no doubt that North Korea is a part of Korea, but the
                                    security treaty which we made with the Republic of Korea makes
                                    clear that the United States will not extend its protection
                                    other than to areas which we recognize as having been lawfully
                                    brought under the jurisdiction of the Republic of Korea, and we
                                    do not believe that aggressive force is such a lawful means.
                                    There is no doubt but that North Viet-Nam is part of Viet-Nam,
                                    but we stated in connection with the Indochina armistice that we
                                    were opposed to any renewal of aggression to bring about the
                                    unification of Viet-Nam.</p>
                                <p>“Both the Republic of China and the Chinese People’s Republic
                                    claim that the area held by the other is part of China. But in
                                    connection with the mutual security treaty which the United
                                    States made with the Republic of China, it was agreed that the
                                    Republic of China would not use force except as a matter of
                                    joint agreement, subject to action of an emergency character
                                    which was clearly an exercise of the inherent right of
                                    self-defense.</p>
                                <p>“We believe that the principle of nonrecourse to force is valid
                                    not merely for the United States and its allies but that it is
                                    valid for all.</p>
                                <p>“We shall hope to find out in the forthcoming talks whether the
                                    Chinese Communists accept the concept of a cease-fire in
                                    accordance with the United Nations principle of avoiding any use
                                    or threat of force which could disturb the peace of nations.</p>
                                <p>“No doubt the Chinese Communists will have matters of their own
                                    to bring up. We shall listen to hear what they are, and if they
                                    directly involve the United States and Communist China we will
                                    be disposed to discuss them with a view to arriving at a
                                    peaceful settlement.</p>

                        <p>In the course of a call on another subject the British Ambassador asked
                            the Secretary whether he could give him any indication of the nature of
                            the instructions which would be given to Amb. <persName

                            Chinese Communists at Geneva beginning on August 1. The Secretary said
                            that the instructions have not yet been prepared and he has not in fact
                            discussed their possible content in any detail with Asst. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>. Generally,
                            however, he commented that the objective will be to focus on obtaining
                            the release of American citizens in Communist China, the course of the
                            negotiations to be determined to a considerable extent by the success
                            achieved in that matter. If some progress is made, the Secretary thought
                            that it might be possible to envisage some sort of an understanding as
                            to a cease-fire in the Formosa Strait and other subjects which might be
                            touched upon could be some arrangement for a neutral, that is probably
                            Swedish, Swiss or International Red Cross, verification of the voluntary
                            decisions of the Chinese students to remain in the U.S., obstacles to
                            shipping (e.g., mine fields), and a relaxation of restrictions against
                            Americans entering Communist China. The Secretary did not envisage that
                            this meeting at Geneva would be of short duration but on the contrary
                            assumed that it might well take a considerable length of time.</p>

                                        >Bulganin</persName> added that considerable Soviet
                                    equipment had been sent to China, but that this had turned out
                                    to be a very expensive operation. He said only economic aid was
                                    now being given to China.</p>

                                    with <persName corresp="#p_BMNA1">Bulganin</persName>, said that
                                    the Soviet leader was either lying, ignorant of the true

                                        >Dulles</persName> then read a detailed listing of Soviet

                                    message expressed concern at the possibility of discussion of a
                                    cease-fire at the pending Geneva talks; it reads in part as
                                    follows:</p>
                                <p>“Our two Governments have a formal understanding that no major
                                    military action will be undertaken in this area by either of us
                                    except by mutual agreement. The withdrawal from the Tachens has
                                    not brought about peace. Aggressive action in the Taiwan Strait
                                    has come and can only come from Peiping. Any offer from your
                                    representative to discuss cease-fire is likely to invite further
                                    demands from Peiping.</p>
                                <p>“We shall abide by the understanding reached with you as our
                                    trusted ally, but may I emphasize again that any open cease-fire
                                    pledge on our part will destroy the very basis of our being and
                                    kill all hope of our brethren on the mainland for eventual
                                    liberation. I believe it is to our interest and yours to keep
                                    such hope alive. Our pledge to you must not be used or hinted at
                                    to trade for any Communist promise, which we know they will not
                                    honor. I shall much appreciate your assurance on this point.”

                        <p>The Ambassador then asked whether the question of a cease-fire in the
                            Formosa Strait would be raised by us or be left to the Communists to
                            bring up. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied
                            that the President had been asked at a press conference last April his
                            views concerning the cease-fire. He said at that time that the
                            Communists must renounce the use of force in the attainment of their
                                objectives.<note n="4" xml:id="d322fn4">Reference is apparently to

                            practical matters” which might be discussed at Geneva, he declared that
                            one of these is the principle of the renunciation of the use of
                            force.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_JUA1"
                                >Johnson</persName> would be authorized to discuss a cease-fire,
                            adding that this could not be an issue between the U.S. and Communist
                            China since the forces of these two countries were not shooting at each
                            other. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that
                            it was very much an issue since we have a Mutual Defense Treaty with the
                            Republic of China which binds us to aid in the defense of Taiwan. If the
                            Communists should attempt to take Taiwan by force, we would be bound to
                            take action in accordance <pb n="684" xml:id="pg_684" facs="0712"/>with
                            our constitutional provisions and would find ourselves at war with the
                            Chinese Communists.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador inquired further what would follow if they should agree to
                            renounce the use of force. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> replied that they have so far refused to do
                            so, but if they should, it would mean that they would have to negotiate
                            for territory they wanted rather than to take it by force. Of course, we
                            could not enter into any such negotiation with respect to Taiwan except
                            in company with the Government of the Republic of China. While the
                            juridical status of Taiwan is in limbo, certainly the Chinese
                            Nationalists have the best right to it of anyone.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador interjected that the status of Taiwan had been determined
                            by the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations which turned the islands over to
                            the Republic of China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> pointed out that it is just those declarations
                            on which the Communists rely in pressing their claim to Taiwan. The
                            Chinese Communists, and other Governments which recognize them, insist
                            that they are the China referred to in those agreements, while we insist
                            that it is the Republic of China.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador asked whether he could inform his Government that we
                            intend to raise the cease-fire question at the Geneva talks. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that he
                            would repeat the Ambassador’s words to the Secretary. He emphasized that
                            the chief cause of tension in the Far East is the threat of force and
                            that by the renunciation of the use of force, tension could be relieved.
                            He went on to say that we have today a divided Germany and a divided
                            Korea. We believe in their unification but the American people are not
                            willing to go to war to unite them. The same applies to China. The
                            American people would not support a war against the Chinese Communists
                            for recovery of the mainland. We are, of course, obligated by treaty to
                            go to the defense of the Government of the Republic of China if it
                            should be attacked. Furthermore, we believe that the <gloss

                            symbol of freedom to millions of Chinese all over the world. We know
                            that there is deep unrest on the mainland and we think that the <gloss
                                target="#t_GRC1">GRC</gloss> should hold itself in readiness to take
                            advantage of developments, but we cannot support an <unclear/>med
                            conquest of the mainland. So far, both contending Chinese sides have
                            refused to renounce force. The Ambassador asked again whether the
                            cease-fire question would be raised at Geneva. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied yes, he expected so,
                            although he emphasized that this was just a personal opinion. He said
                            that we are still in the process of developing the tactics we will use
                            at Geneva and it is impossible to say now what problems will come up. He
                            referred to the Secretary’s repeated statements that renunciation of the
                            use of force was necessary <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0713"/>in
                            order to release tension. He said that he would take up the question
                            with the Secretary.</p>

                                    their respective countries and to facilitate further discussion
                                    and settlement of certain other practical matters now at issue

                                <item>You should seek agreement that the talks will be conducted in
                                    an atmosphere of privacy and that no other than routine public
                                    statements will be made regarding them, except as may be
                                    approved by both sides or after prior notification by one side
                                    to the other. The approval or notification from our side is to
                                    be authorized by the Department of State. In the main, you will
                                    discourage publicity about, and exaggeration of, the
                                    meeting.</item>

                                <item>You may in your discretion meet socially with the <gloss

                                <item>It is, of course, understood that the conversations upon which
                                    you are to engage do not involve diplomatic recognition.</item>

                                <item>Since the scope of your talks is “practical matters now at
                                    issue between both sides”, i.e., the U.S. and the <gloss
                                        target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss>, you will not discuss issues
                                    which involve the rights of the Republic of China. If you are in
                                    doubt as to the practical application of this instruction, you
                                    will seek guidance from the Department of State.</item>
                                <label>(8)</label>
                                <item>The U.S. is willing to talk about “other practical matters”
                                    than the repatriation of civilians because we do not want to
                                    have unnecessary differences with anyone if these differences
                                    can be honorably resolved.</item>
                                <label>(9)</label>
                                <item>Direct talks have been preferred to carrying on discussions
                                    through intermediaries. The reason is that there is more apt to
                                    be misunderstanding when matters are dealt with through
                                    intermediaries; therefore, we believe direct dealings should, in
                                    the first instance at least, be tried.</item>
                                <label>(10)</label>
                                <item>The first agreed purpose of the meeting is already the subject
                                    of bilateral talks, i.e., “settling the matter of repatriation
                                    of civilians who desire to return to their respective
                                    countries”. You will seek immediate authorization to U.S.
                                    civilians to return to the U.S. You may point out that so long
                                    as American civilians are held under restraint on the mainland
                                    of China, there is bound to be ill feeling in the U.S. We are
                                    not, however, willing to promise political concessions to obtain
                                    their release. Only voluntary action by the <gloss
                                        target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> would really serve to remove
                                    the widespread resentment now felt in the U.S. because of the
                                    mistreatment by the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> of U.S.
                                    citizens.</item>
                                <label>(11)</label>
                                <item>You are authorized formally to assure the <gloss
                                        target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> representative that the U.S.
                                    does not impose restraints upon Chinese civilians who desire to
                                    return to the Mainland. The U.S. is prepared to authorize some
                                    mutually agreeable government through its embassy in the U.S. to
                                    assist Chinese students who desire to return to the China
                                    mainland and to be a medium for the transmission of funds
                                    required for this purpose.</item>

                                <item>One of the “other practical matters now at issue between both
                                    sides” is the prisoners of war who were under the <gloss

                                    wishes to reinforce that initiative and you should raise this
                                    matter concurrently with the matter of the U.S. civilians. The
                                    considerations above (paragraph 10) alluded to in reference to
                                    U.S. civilians apply with equal or greater force with respect to
                                    the U.S. military, who are deemed covered by the Korean

                                        emphasize the deep concern of the U.S. in getting assurance
                                        that the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> is prepared to

                                    <p>If the <gloss target="#t_CPR1">CPR</gloss> representative
                                        contends that the use of force in the Formosa area is
                                        justifiable because this involves a domestic matter, i.e.,
                                        the unification of China, you may point out that the fact of
                                        a divided China is not basically different from the fact of
                                        a divided Korea, Germany, and Vietnam. It could be argued in
                                        each of these cases that unification is purely an internal
                                        matter. But in reality resort to force would endanger
                                        international peace and security. The same applies to China.
                                        The U.S. believes that the principle of non-recourse to
                                        force is valid not merely for the U.S. and its allies, but
                                        for all.</p></item>

                        <p>On July 30, Premier <persName corresp="#p_CE1">Chou En-lai</persName>
                            made a speech before the National People’s Congress concerning the
                            international situation and Chinese foreign policy. The text of his
                            speech reads in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“After the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in
                                    Indo-China, the situation in the Taiwan area has become the most
                                    tense in the Far East. It must be pointed out that this tension
                                    has been caused by the United States’ occupation of China’s
                                    territory Taiwan and its interference with the liberation of
                                    China’s coastal islands. This is an international issue between
                                    China and the United States. The exercise by the Chinese people
                                    of their sovereign rights in liberating Taiwan is a matter of
                                    China’s internal affairs. These two questions cannot be mixed
                                    up. During the Asian-African Conference, the Chinese Government
                                    already proposed that China and the United States should sit
                                    down and enter into negotiations to discuss the question of
                                    easing and eliminating the tension in the Taiwan area. There is
                                    no war between China and the United States; the peoples of China
                                    and the United States are friendly towards each other; the
                                    Chinese people want no war with the United States, so the
                                    question of cease-fire between China and the United States does
                                    not arise. After the Asian-African Conference, the Chinese
                                    Government has further stated that there are two possible ways
                                    for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, namely, by war or by
                                    peaceful means. Conditions permitting, the Chinese people are
                                    ready to seek the liberation of Taiwan by peaceful means. In the
                                    course of the liberation by the Chinese people of the mainland
                                    and the coastal islands, there was no lack of precedents for
                                    peaceful liberation. Provided that the United States does not
                                    interfere with China’s internal affairs, the possibility of
                                    peaceful liberation of Taiwan will continue to increase. If
                                    possible, the Chinese Government is willing to enter into
                                    negotiations with the responsible local authorities of Taiwan to
                                    map out concrete steps for Taiwan’s peaceful liberation. It
                                    should be made clear that these would be negotiations between
                                    the central government and local authorities. The Chinese people
                                    are firmly opposed to any ideas or plots of the so-called ‘two
                                    Chinas.’”</p>

                        <p>Concerning the pending ambassadorial talks, Premier <persName
                                corresp="#p_CE1">Chou</persName> stated that, if both sides
                            sincerely desired negotiation and conciliation, “It should be possible
                            in the forthcoming talks at the ambassadorial level to reach, first of
                            all, a reasonable settlement of the question of the return of civilians
                            to their respective countries. The number of American civilians in China
                            is small, and their question can be easily settled. … We are of the
                            opinion that since there are no diplomatic relations between China and
                            the United States at the present time, each of them can entrust to a
                            third country the task of looking after the affairs of its civilians in
                            the other country, and primarily the return of these civilians to their
                            own country.”</p>

                        <p>Noting that the ambassadorial talks were also to “facilitate further
                            discussions and settlement of certain other practical matters now at
                            issue between both sides”, and referring to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_EDD1">Eisenhower</persName>’s words quoted by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DJF1">Dulles</persName> at his July 26 press
                            conference (see <ref target="#d319">Document 319</ref>), he declared
                            that if those words signified that the United States was prepared to
                            cooperate with China, “the Sino-American talks at the ambassadorial
                            level should be able to make preparations for negotiations between China
                            and the United States for relaxing and eliminating the tension in the
                            Taiwan area.”</p>
