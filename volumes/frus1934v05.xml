                        <p>1. The following was left at the Foreign Office: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Recently during the course of discussions concerning the
                                    question of exchange facilities the Foreign Office made the
                                    following tentative suggestions towards according the American
                                    Government satisfaction on exchange matters.</p>
                                <p>The Chilean Government, recognizing that its commerce and
                                    [omission] in the United States are not subject to any exchange
                                    control restrictions, would undertake to accord reciprocal
                                    treatment to the United States by lifting entirety all control
                                    or exchange restrictions with reference to genuine American
                                    interests in Chile. This would include the removal of these
                                    restrictions both as to exchange for the current needs of
                                    American commerce and for the repatriation of recognized
                                    American funds.</p>
                                <p>In view of the nature of the retirement funds of Americans the
                                    repayment of these funds would be subject to special
                                    treatment.</p>
                                <p>In order that the suggested solution may be placed before the
                                    Secretary of State may the Embassy be authorized to present this
                                    solution as a concrete proposal on the part of the Chilean
                                    Government?”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs authorized me yesterday to present this
                            as a concrete proposal on the part of the Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>The plan does not remove entirely the discriminatory effects on our
                            commerce of Chile’s compensation agreements. Neither does it grant us
                            the relatively small percentage of exchange at the preferential rate now
                            obtained by countries with blocking agreements, but the door would not
                            be closed to private agreements such as in Brazil.</p>
                        <p>However, the agreement does have the great merit of asserting the
                            principle of trade free from exchange control and it is believed would
                            constitute an important step towards breaking down compensation and
                            exchange restrictions in Chile. Furthermore, it would eliminate the
                            disadvantage inherent in any blocking arrangement aiming to accord <pb
                                n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0068"/>us preferential exchange which can
                            be obtained only at the expense of other American interests doing
                            business in Chile. The proposed arrangement would be fair to all classes
                            of American interests and would not later prejudice the movement of
                            exchange should a settlement be reached in favor of American holders of
                            Chilean bonds.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed this proposal with the Secretary. While he does not
                            desire to go into technical details he approves the principle of the
                            proposal as an important step looking towards the removal of trade
                            barriers.</p>
                        <p>I feel that the proposal represents a sincere and courageous effort to
                            give us satisfaction and that it is about the maximum we can hope to
                            obtain. The advantages towards Chilean-American trade and relations far
                            outweigh, in my opinion, the disadvantages and I recommend that it be
                            accepted as a basis for an agreement.</p>

                        <p>7. Your urgent telegram No. 1, January 5, 6 p.m. The Department is not
                            clear what the scope of the Chilean proposal is and desires further
                            clarification. How would the Chilean proposal affect an importer of
                            American goods who sought foreign exchange to pay for them? What would
                            be the attitude of the Exchange Control Commission toward his request
                            for exchange? Would the exchange be granted to such importers in
                            unlimited amounts and if not upon what principle? Does proposal mean
                            that the Exchange Control Commission will continue arbitrarily to decide
                            what amounts it will grant to American interests? Or does the proposal
                            merely mean free access to the bootleg market, and an opportunity to
                            make private agreements, which is the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            situation at present? What advantage does the Chilean Government allege
                            would be obtained by private agreements? What is meant by “genuine
                            American interests[?]”</p>

                        <p>3. Department’s telegram No. 7, January 6, 3 p.m. The scope of the
                            proposal contemplates the removal of all control and restrictions <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0069"/>with regard to the purchase of
                            exchange for the needs of American business. This includes current
                            business, frozen credits and other transfers. Exchange for American
                            needs would no longer be subject to the Exchange Control Commission.
                            This means that our commerce would be on a free basis; that an importer
                            of American goods would unrestrictedly purchase the exchange required
                            wherever available and that exchange for American business could be
                            obtained in unlimited amounts subject only to the normal laws of supply
                            and demand. In operation the Chilean Government would need only to be
                            satisfied that transactions under the agreement were not effecting the
                            transfer of non-American funds, hence the insertion of the word
                            “genuine”.</p>
                        <p>While no immediate advantages are apparent in private agreements the
                            proposal does not preclude them later if found desirable.</p>
                        <p>American interests which have been discreetly sounded on the general
                            principle contained in the proposal view it with favor. Among other
                            reasons they appreciate the great advantage of being able to liquidate
                            their frozen assets legally and as they desire rather than awaiting a
                            possible future liquidation at a preferential rate. Before undertaking
                            to work out the mechanical details the Foreign Office desires to be
                            informed whether principle is acceptable to the United States Government
                            as a basis for negotiations. Please instruct by cable in this
                            respect.</p>

                        <p>10. Your telegram No. 3, January 9, 5 p.m. Does the Chilean proposal mean
                            that the Exchange Control Commission will continue to allot to American
                            interests the same share of available exchange as heretofore and that,
                            in addition, persons desiring to remit funds to the United States will
                            have legal access to other sources of exchange such as the bootleg
                            market? The point of particular importance is whether persons desiring
                            to make remittances to the United States would receive treatment no more
                            unfavorable, at the hands of the Exchange Control Commission, than they
                            have received in the past. Would the Chilean proposal include assurances
                            on this point?</p>
                        <p>As we see it at present, the Chilean proposal offers merely that in
                            addition to what they now receive from the Exchange Control Commission,
                            persons desiring to remit funds to the United States would have (1)
                            legal access to bootleg market, (2) right to use exchange obtained
                            therein for any purpose desired, that is, for frozen credits or other
                            transfers.</p>

                        <p>You may say to the Chilean authorities that this Government is not yet in
                            a position either to reject or accept the proposal, but that it will be
                            given sympathetic consideration if formulated in precise language.</p>
                        <p>Has a similar proposal been made to the British Embassy and, if so, have
                            you any information as to the attitude of the British Government

                        <p>4. Department’s telegram No. 10, January 11, 6 p.m. The principle of the
                            proposal is to remove as concerns American interests all exchange
                            control and restriction, thus establishing reciprocal treatment
                            concerning exchange. In other words, the Chilean Government would
                            undertake unequivocally to do away with all exchange control as far as
                            American interests are concerned placing our commerce virtually on the
                            same basis as it was prior to the establishment of exchange control in
                            1931.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the advantages set forth in your paragraph 2 there should
                            be added the following which have been confirmed in conversations with
                            the Foreign Office: <list>

                                    Department. The exchange requirements of American interests
                                    would be subject not to any arbitrary allocation of the present

                        <p>Your paragraph 3. The Embassy is uncertain whether the Department’s
                            apparent reluctance to express its position in regard to the principle
                            of exchange liberalization involved in the Chilean proposal is because
                            of certain considerations of general policy extraneous to Chile or
                            because it was not satisfied as to the full scope of the proposal. I
                            believe that the Chilean Government is disposed to give us, in working
                            out the details, the formal assurances which we may require to put the
                            arrangement successfully in operation but I feel we should decide now
                            whether the general principle involved is acceptable before asking the
                            Chilean Government to elaborate details.</p>
                        <p>The Chilean Government made subsequently a similar proposal to the
                            British, and the Embassy has recommended its acceptance stating that
                            “the proposal offers a practical basis for a solution to our exchange
                            problems in Chile”. The British Foreign Office is now considering the
                            proposal.</p>

                        <p>13. Your No. 4, January 13. Department’s position as conveyed in previous
                            cables to you is not complicated by any considerations of general policy
                            either related to Chile or extraneous to Chile. It merely still feels
                            unable to measure the meaning of the Chilean proposal.</p>
                        <p>As we understand it, the Chilean Government offers to permit purchasers
                            of American goods and those who wish to remit frozen funds to the United
                            States freely to do so. But as long as there is an Exchange Commission
                            functioning, and exporters of Chilean products must turn over to that
                            Commission the main proceeds of their foreign sales, how satisfactory an
                            opportunity does this offer to purchasers of American goods? That is the
                            primary question under consideration here.</p>
                        <p>Is the Department to understand that all exporters to the United States
                            and to all countries other than those with which Chile has compensation
                            agreements will be absolved from turning over their exchange to the
                            Exchange Commission whereby it will become available in the bootleg
                            market for purchase by those who wish to import from the United States
                            or to transfer funds to the United States?</p>
                        <p>The Department would be inclined to accept the Chilean proposal in
                            principle, subject to agreement on details, provided the answer to the
                            question set forth in the preceding paragraph is in the affirmative and
                            provided that the Chilean Government will undertake not <pb n="6"
                                xml:id="pg_6" facs="0072"/>to diminish the amount of foreign
                            exchange thus available to American interests, by the conclusion of new
                            compensation agreements or otherwise.</p>

                            the United States the Chilean Government would modify either by virtue
                            of an international treaty or appropriate legislation the monetary law
                            under which the Exchange Control Commission now operates. This measure
                            would remove exchange control and import and export restrictions with
                            countries such as the United States, not imposing similar restrictions.
                            However, control would be retained on transactions with countries having
                            compensation agreements or imposing restrictions on Chilean trade.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph[s] 2 and 3. The proceeds of sales to countries not
                            imposing restrictions would not be turned over to the Commission but
                            would be available in the free market. Importers of American goods or
                            those transferring funds to the United States would still have free
                            access to any available unblocked exchange arising from transactions
                            with countries imposing restrictions. It is understood that the bank
                            acceptances of the nitrate industry will be practically liquidated by
                            March and it is estimated that $2,500,000 will be returned to Chile
                            during the present year which will be available in the export draft
                            market. Specifically then the purchaser of American goods would have a
                            legal right without any restriction to make purchases desired. Today
                            they have no right, the recent liberality of the Commission being due
                            exclusively to Government convenience in view of the excess supply of
                            exchange availabilities.</p>
                        <p>Your paragraph 4. Chile is not in a position to make a formal commitment
                            that the amount of exchange available to American interests as indicated
                            above will not be diminished by new compensation agreements. In order
                            not to lose its European markets it has already been and is still being
                            forced to conclude such arrangements. However, even though Chile should
                            refuse to make any others it would result in no gain to us in current
                            business since the countries denied <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0073"
                            />such arrangements would undoubtedly prohibit imports from Chile. This
                            would mean not only the reduction of Chile’s purchasing power abroad and
                            a direct loss to American copper and nitrate industries but the possible
                            impairment of our enormous stake in Chile. We must therefore take into
                            consideration the special aspects of our problem. Obviously some
                            exchange would be removed from the free market through the conclusion of
                            new compensation treaties. On the other hand as indicated above there
                            will be important new sources of exchange. It is believed that exchange
                            availabilities will be sufficient to cover American goods within Chile’s
                            very limited import purchasing power.</p>
                        <p>Stated in my telegram No. 1, January 5, 6 p.m. is that our frozen
                            commercial assets would not be liquidated at the preferential rate
                            created through blockage arrangements. In this connection it would be
                            pointed out that in the German Treaty about to be signed<note n="2"

                        <p>While the Chilean offer to us on the eve of concluding further
                            compensation agreements would appear paradoxical, in reality it
                            indicates only too clearly the strong pressure being exerted on this
                            country and which the Foreign Office itself admits it is unable to
                            resist. To be effective therefore our attack against compensation
                            systems should be centered even more in Europe than in Chile.</p>

                        <p>14. Your No. 7, January 19, 4.00 p.m. Department still does not feel
                            itself in possession of a sufficiently systematic analysis of Chilean
                            trade relationships and commitments to measure the results of the
                            Chilean proposal. Inasmuch as the Chilean Government by its control of
                            foreign exchange is alone in a position to interpret quantitatively its
                            recent proposal you will please request the appropriate Chilean
                            authorities to supply you with official estimates for 1933 of the totals
                            below-mentioned, in order that this Government may be in a position
                            adequately to judge the value of the Chilean proposal to American
                            interests: <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0074"/>

                        <p>At the same time you may convey the Department’s opinion that a solution
                            might be found if Chile would decide to divide foreign countries into
                            two classes: (1) Countries which would look for their exchange solely to
                            compensation agreements; (2) countries which would derive their exchange
                            solely from the free market. In accordance with this idea, would the
                            Chilean Government agree that access to the free exchange market would
                            under its proposal be available only to countries in the second
                            category? Otherwise it would appear that countries having compensation
                            arrangements would not only be definitely assured certain quantities of
                            exchange under those arrangements, but also would be in a position to
                            compete for exchange available in the free market, largely supplied by
                            sales of Chilean goods to the United States. On the other hand those
                            wishing to make transfers to the United States not only would have no
                            definite assurance through compensation agreements but would have to
                            compete even in the free market with countries which do have such
                            agreements. The Department is loath to believe that such can be the
                            intention of the Chilean Government. Please discuss this point further
                            with it.</p>
                        <p>In the Department’s judgment the importance to the American trade
                            interest of the American owned nitrate enterprises in Chile should not
                            be overestimated, since contrary to the usual tendency of such companies
                            to purchase in the United States the proceeds from nitrate sales under
                            the compensation agreements are being used to finance imports from
                            countries other than the United States.</p>

                            this afternoon and stated that despite provision of recently concluded
                            German-Chilean compensation treaty stipulating the use of export rate of
                            exchange for new business, Chilean Government may possibly guarantee a
                            lower rate of exchange for the purchase of German locomotives even at a
                            higher price than that offered by the Baldwin people in order to promote
                            nitrate sales to Germany.</p>
                        <p>Please confer at once with Wessel Duval, representatives of Baldwin, and
                            if in your judgment discrimination seems probable, discuss this matter
                            informally with appropriate Chilean officials and ask that there be no

                        <p>17. Your telegram No. 18. The question has been discussed with the
                            representatives of Baldwin and an interview with the Foreign Office has
                            been arranged for tomorrow. In the meantime the Baldwin
                            representative[s] believe it will be helpful for the Department to talk
                            to the Chilean Ambassador who was formerly Director General of Railways
                            and who might be disposed to cable his Government recommending <pb

                        <p>18. I discussed informally the substance of the Department’s telegram No.
                            18, February 8 [<hi rend="italic">5</hi>], 6 p.m., with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs requesting that there be no discrimination against
                            American interests. The Minister stated that he was not personally
                            familiar with the question but that it would not be Chile’s policy to
                            purchase German railway equipment at a higher price if the American
                            equipment were equally satisfactory. He added that he would talk to the
                            Minister of Finance as soon as the latter returned and would inform us
                            further in the premises.</p>

                        <p>19. Your telegram No. 17, February 6, noon. The Department informally
                            apprised the Chilean Ambassador of the circumstances surrounding the
                            Baldwin bid and explained this Government’s viewpoint that its nationals
                            should be given equal treatment with other foreign competitors for
                            Chilean business. It was made clear to the Ambassador that all we ask is
                            equality of treatment in the exchange matter. The Ambassador said that
                            he would cable his Government immediately, urging that no step be taken
                            which might be construed as discriminatory and that American companies
                            be given equal exchange treatment.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_11" facs="0077"/>Government along the lines of its
                            proposal as amended to date. We understand that the Chilean Government
                            is disposed to accord the following: <list>

                                    reference to remittances to the United States. This means legal
                                    and free access to the unofficial and export draft markets for
                                        (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) repatriation of funds; (<hi

                                    would be honored by the competent Chilean authorities at
                                    most-favored-nation rates to the extent that such foreign
                                    exchange is available. (We understand that in your conversations
                                    with the Foreign Office, the latter has expressed its
                                    willingness to guarantee that there shall be no discrimination
                                    in exchange rates applicable to current and future transactions,

                                    having compensation agreements. This we regard as essential to
                                    protect our new business and the least that the Chilean
                                    Government can do in view of its unwillingness to bind itself
                                    not to conclude additional compensation agreements.)</item>

                                    an equitable agreement for the liquidation of frozen

                        <p>In conveying No. 3 to the Chilean Government you will point out that the
                            recent compensation agreement concluded with Germany aggravates the long
                            continued discrimination against American interests in the matter of the
                            rate of conversion of frozen credits, against which the United States,
                            as Chile’s best customer, has protested and continues emphatically to
                            protest.</p>
                        <p>In order that we may be in a position to judge the fairness of these
                            arrangements, would the Chilean Government be prepared to inform the

                            Chile’s exports and otherwise, (2) the amount segregated for various
                            national interests under compensation agreements, (3) the amounts made
                            available for purchases from the United States or remittances to the
                            United States.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 21, February 17, 2 p.m., 1934, informing the
                            Embassy that it is prepared to accept for a trial period the proposal
                            made by the Chilean Government to lift exchange control as concerns
                            American commerce. The substance of the Department’s telegram was set
                            forth in a Memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed herewith,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d15fn4">Not printed.</note> and left at the Foreign Office
                            to-day. As will be seen, the Memorandum follows closely the wording
                            employed in the telegram except for one or two slight variations.</p>
                        <p>It was considered essential to change the text of point No. 1 in order to
                            avoid any possibility of an interpretation limiting the scope of the
                            agreement to the remittance of funds to the United States and thus
                            excluding other transactions such as the re-export of consignment
                            merchandise. The Department will recall the tremendous difficulties
                            which the Embassy has had and continues to experience in obtaining the
                            release of such merchandise. Each case has had to be argued separately
                            since the Control Commission has refused to accept the authorization in
                            any one case as the establishment of a precedent. Favorable action has
                            been obtained only by repeatedly bringing pressure through the Foreign
                            Office. It would be a very great benefit to the interested concerns
                            faced with the problem of returning American goods unsaleable in Chile,
                            if it is definitely established that the accord provides for the removal
                            of trade restrictions as well as exchange control.</p>
                        <p>The phrase “unofficial market” in point No. 2, has been changed to read
                            “other sources of exchange.” This was done for the reason that it was
                            not believed that the Chilean Government would be disposed or could
                            recognize in a formal document the existence of the illegal unofficial
                            or bootleg market. Hence, it was thought desirable to avoid the use of
                            this term in an, international agreement.</p>
                        <p>Point No. 4 has been amplified in order to make a more specific statement
                            concerning the rate of exchange. The employees who were obliged by law
                            to contribute to the Retirement Fund Bank had the privilege of electing
                            the currency in which their individual retirement funds would be
                            constituted, that is, dollars or pesos, the dollar accounts, however,
                            being penalized by receiving at first a lower rate of interest and
                            subsequently no interest at all. As these funds were contributed at a
                            time when a parity of exchange existed, a specific <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0079"/>understanding should be reached, if
                            possible, to provide a satisfactory rate for the repatriation of the
                            peso accounts. It would appear only fair for the Chilean Government to
                            allocate exchange at the official rate for this purpose. Although the
                            total amount involved is relatively small, it may be difficult to obtain
                            from the Chilean Government the full measure of satisfaction desired. In
                            the conversations which the Embassy has had on this point, the Foreign
                            Office has been extremely vague and has indicated very little interest
                            in giving relief to these small and deserving cases.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon, in the absence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I
                            went over the Memorandum with Mr. Ross, the Minister of Hacienda. Mr.
                            Ross expressed himself most emphatically as desiring to give the United
                            States complete satisfaction and to reach an understanding which would
                            place the commercial relations of the two countries on a better basis.
                            He stated that he realized that Chile’s future was bound up with that of
                            the United States and that Europe was not interested in doing anything
                            for Chile and in any event that it was too torn up by its continual
                            bickerings and internal turmoils to give any sympathetic consideration
                            to Chilean affairs. Taking up specifically the points in the Memorandum,
                            Mr. Ross made the following comments:</p>
                        <p>In regard to point No. 1 he stated that Chile was ready to lift
                            immediately all exchange control restrictions as far as our current
                            trade is concerned. It was also willing to lift the exchange
                            restrictions in regard to frozen credits as had been promised, but in
                            order to work out an orderly process for the transfer of these funds
                            without demoralizing the exchange market, it would be necessary for the
                            Minister of Hacienda to know exactly what amount of money American firms
                            or individuals desired to transfer and approximately over what periods
                            of time. In answer to this point I informed the Minister that the
                            Embassy had this information in its records but would of course have to
                            obtain the consent of the firms involved before supplying it to the
                            Chilean Government.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the question of discrimination in exchange rates as
                            between the United States and countries having compensation agreements,
                            the Minister stated that a decree had been drafted and would be
                            promulgated to-day or to-morrow, definitely fixing the rate of exchange
                            for all countries at the daily commercial rate of exchange based on the
                            pound or the dollar. (This of course would not refer to the rate on
                            frozen credits provided for in compensation agreements). He added that
                            this would definitely preclude any discrimination as concerns current
                            trade.</p>
                        <p>With regard to point No. 2, the Minister stated there was no difficulty;
                            that nations which had forced compensation agreements on Chile would be
                            held strictly within the limitations of those agreements.</p>
                        <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0080"/>
                        <p>In discussing point No. 3, Mr. Ross stated that there was no objection as
                            far as he could see to a private proposal being subsequently worked
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Point No. 4, with regard to the payment of American citizens holding
                            retirement funds seemed to present virtually the only real difficulty in
                            the entire proposal. Mr. Ross stated that the Chilean Government was not
                            in a position to repay all of the dollar accounts in their full value in
                            dollars; that the Government would be prepared to repay dollar for
                            dollar the holders of these accounts who had left Chile or depositors
                            who planned to leave Chile immediately upon the withdrawal of their
                            accounts. On the other hand, he felt that because of the great
                            difference of purchasing power of the dollar in Chile and abroad,
                            depositors who were domiciled in Chile should accept a settlement on a
                            lower basis.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the peso accounts he stated that the Chilean Government
                            would not be prepared to pay these at the old par value but that some
                            arrangement for what he termed a fair rate of exchange would be worked
                            out for the holders of peso accounts who were now living abroad or who
                            would immediately leave the country upon payment of these accounts.</p>
                        <p>In reply to the Minister’s comments on this question I stated that I
                            would of course transmit his proposal to Washington where it would be
                            given sympathetic consideration but that as I knew that the American
                            Government was very interested in these very worthy cases, I could give
                            no assurance that it would be acceptable.</p>
                        <p>With regard to supplying the Embassy with monthly statistics on exchange
                            matters, the Minister said that the Chilean Government would be
                            perfectly willing to supply all the information which it could on this
                            question. He pointed out, however, that the form in which the Government
                            received its information from the Customshouse and other sources did not
                            lend itself to breaking down into the statistics which we desired. For
                            example, in the case of nitrate, the export statistics received by the
                            Government would indicate on their face exchange created more or less
                            equal to the value of nitrate sold whereas in actual fact, a large part
                            of the proceeds of such sales was used in payment of financing costs and
                            other charges against the industry and did not come back to Chile in the
                            form of free exchange. A somewhat similar situation also existed in
                            regard to the copper companies.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the Minister again assured me of the very earnest desire of
                            Chile to give satisfaction to the United States Government. In this
                            connection he stressed the fact that Chile appreciated deeply the
                            treatment which it was receiving at the hands of the American Government
                            in allowing it to sell its products freely in our markets <pb n="15"
                                xml:id="pg_15" facs="0081"/>and that for this very reason it was
                            most anxious that the United States should not obtain the impression
                            that its commerce with Chile could be stimulated by adopting the
                            bullying tactics of the European countries. He added that he felt that
                            the United States had every advantage by accepting a proposal along the
                            lines of the Chilean offer since, when world business increased,
                            American commerce would be in a position immediately to benefit by this
                            change, whereas countries with compensation agreements would be held by
                            Chile strictly within those agreements. The Minister promised that the
                            Chilean Government would reply point by point to the Memorandum which
                            had been submitted.</p>
                        <p>As a result of my interview I feel encouraged that we will be able to
                            obtain from the Chilean Government an accord on exchange facilities
                            substantially in conformity with the Department’s desires. As the form
                            of any agreement which may be entered into has not been discussed with
                            the Chilean Government the Department’s instructions or suggestions on
                            this point would be helpful. It is presumed that the simplest and most
                            satisfactory form would be through an exchange of notes.</p>

                        <p>23. With reference to my telegram February 8, noon. Minister of Hacienda
                            informed me this afternoon that the order for 20 railroad coaches will
                            go to the American Company but that a decision has not been taken
                            concerning locomotives. He added that the German bid is 20,000 pesos
                            lower per locomotive than the American but that the question is still
                            being studied. He gave me definite assurance that decision will be made
                            exclusively on the merits of the offers without taking into
                            consideration the promotion of nitrate sales to Germany.</p>

                            Embassy’s Memorandum on the granting of exchange facilities to American
                            commerce which was submitted to the Chilean Foreign Office under date of

                            Department’s telegram No. 21 of February 17, 2 p.m., 1934, I have the
                            honor to transmit herewith for the information and consideration of the
                            Department, a copy of a report entitled “The Liquidation of American
                            Frozen Credits,”<note n="6" xml:id="d17fn2">Not printed.</note> prepared
                            by Merwin L. Bohan, Commercial Attaché, and Edward J. Sparks, III,
                            Secretary of Embassy. This report was prepared with the idea of
                            furnishing the Department with all available information on the frozen
                            credit aspect of the exchange problem and of making concrete suggestions
                            as to possible bases for the negotiation of a private arrangement for a
                            more equitable solution of this particular phase of the general
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>The report discusses the desirability, as well as the possibility, of
                            negotiating and concluding a private arrangement for the liquidation of
                            American credits frozen in Chile at an agreed rate of exchange more
                            favorable than the rate obtaining in the export draft or unofficial
                            markets. Four possible methods are suggested for providing the necessary
                            foreign exchange. The most acceptable arrangement, however, appears to
                            be the repayment by those holding credits of the peso advances made to
                            the nitrate industry by the Central Bank of Chile, and the deposit to
                            the account of the creditors at fixed intervals by the Nitrate Sales
                            Corporation of the corresponding foreign exchange. The report also
                            discusses the paramount question which would arise in any negotiations
                            of this nature, namely, the rate of exchange at which conversions would
                            be made, and suggests certain bases which might serve for negotiating
                            and determining an equitable rate for conversion. The conclusion is
                            reached that if these negotiations are to be attended with success, they
                            should be initiated immediately and that at least an agreement on
                            principle should be reached before the general arrangement now being
                            discussed by the Embassy with the Chilean authorities is formally
                            concluded.</p>

                        <p>33. Referring to my despatch No. 54, February 21st, the text of the
                            Foreign Office reply air mailed today.<note n="7" xml:id="d18fn7">Text
                                of Foreign Office reply not printed.</note> The following summarizes
                            point by point:</p>
                        <p>1. Chile will remove as soon as it may be possible existing restrictions
                            on remittances and other transactions with the United States, <pb n="17"
                                xml:id="pg_17" facs="0083"/>will grant free access to the export
                            draft market and perceives no objection to the use of new sources of
                            exchange for American commerce. (The Under Secretary explained orally
                            that no mention had been made of the unofficial market since it is
                            believed that it will cease to exist when the free market opens.) In
                            order to prevent discrimination in exchange rates on current business,
                            blocked credits for new business under compensation treaties must be
                            sold with a surcharge of 250 per cent over the official rate thus making
                            these rates virtually equivalent to the export draft rate. The surcharge
                            will be modified as exchange conditions vary. The Government will make
                            every effort to maintain this equivalency but it points out that the
                            moneys withheld under compensation treaties are the property of private
                            individuals and that they, in order to liquidate those credits in the
                            event of an exchange supply, might agree privately to transactions at
                            rates lower than those fixed by the Government. The Government admits
                            its inability to control such transactions.</p>
                        <p>2. Agreed. Exception made that the purchase can be authorized if the
                            current business blockage is exhausted and it involves a specific
                            article unobtainable elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>3. Insists upon making it clear that the Chilean Government has no
                            objection whatsoever to concluding an agreement with the United States
                            absolutely and entirely similar in character to the German agreement and
                            that in signing that agreement it was its intention to accord equal
                            treatment to other countries. But if the United States prefers free
                            commercial interchange without restriction or control, Chile is not in a
                            position to grant in addition a fixed rate of exchange for the
                            liquidation of blocked credits. That commitment of this nature would
                            constitute a discrimination against the countries having compensation
                            agreements. That to authorize free unblocking and to fix at the same
                            time a rate therefor would be to accord a privilege which it is not in a
                            position to grant and which it has not granted to any other country.</p>
                        <p>4. The Government will undertake to obtain from the Caja<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d18fn8">Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares.</note>
                            the return of the dollar funds and the transfer of the peso funds at the
                            export draft rate. It holds that since peso funds were invested under
                            equal conditions with those of other foreigners and Chileans, it is not
                            in a position nor would it be equitable to authorize their transfer at
                            the official rate.</p>
                        <p>The Control Commission has been instructed to be prepared to furnish the
                            statistical data requested.</p>
                        <p>The reply concludes with the explanation that only a very small part of
                            the value of Chile’s principal exports is available to the country and
                            that from the export of nitrate and copper only the cost of production,
                            representing a very small percentage of the value of the products
                            exported, remains in Chile.</p>
                        <p>The Under Secretary states that no decision has been taken as yet as to
                            the manner of making effective the facilities which would be granted
                            although he believes that it would be by virtue of a law.</p>
                        <p>The assurances regarding the maintenance of equivalency in exchange rates
                            on new business are insufficient and unsatisfactory. <pb n="18"
                                xml:id="pg_18" facs="0084"/>While the Government is unable to
                            control exchange rates in the smaller transactions, the bulk of the
                            blockages arises from nitrate sales and since the Government exercises
                            complete supervision over that industry it is in a position to guarantee
                            that at least none of these transactions will be effected at a
                            discriminatory rate.</p>
                        <p>The position taken with respect to point 3 is unacceptable since it tends
                            to preclude the conclusion of a private agreement for the liquidation of
                            frozen credits.</p>
                        <p>I cannot help but feel that the Minister of Finance believes that he can
                            manipulate exchange to suit Chile’s conveniences and that by negotiating
                            separately with the individual creditors he will get for Chile, at the
                            expense of these creditors, appreciable advantages which could not be
                            obtained through a new private agreement. The local representatives of
                            American companies are distrustful of his motives. In this connection I
                            desire to recommend careful consideration of the Embassy’s despatch No.
                            69, due Washington Wednesday, which discusses the desirability of
                            negotiating, simultaneously with the general agreement for exchange
                            facilities, a private arrangement for the liquidation of frozen
                            credits.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 71 of March 17, 1934,<note n="9" xml:id="d19fn9">Not printed; but

                                    >supra</hi>.</note> reporting the status of our negotiations
                            concerning the agreement to accord exchange facilities to American
                            commerce. On its face the Memorandum of the Chilean Government setting
                            forth its interpretation and modification of the proposal on exchange,
                            seemed so unsatisfactory and appeared to depart so greatly from the
                            spirit of the original offer that it was felt desirable to arrange for a
                            long conference in an attempt to clear up the points at variance. On
                            Saturday, March 24th, therefore, Mr. Scott, Mr. Sparks and Mr. Bohan had
                            a long conversation with the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr.
                            Vergara, a record of which is enclosed.<note n="10" xml:id="d19fn10">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>This conversation brought out the fact that the unsatisfactory nature of
                            the Chilean Government’s reply was due in part to a misunderstanding of
                            the significance of the English text of our Memorandum and partly to
                            certain practical and reasonable considerations which became apparent
                            when a closer study of actually putting the <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19"
                                facs="0085"/>plan into operation was undertaken. As a result of the
                            conversation referred to above, and a further discussion which took
                            place with Mr. Vergara yesterday, it is felt that the points which
                            presented difficulties have been largely cleared up and that the Chilean
                            Government is in virtual agreement with us as to the substance of our
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Following the discussion on March 24th, in order to advance our
                            negotiations a memorandum dated March 27th (Enclosure No. 2)<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d19fn11">Printed on <ref target="#pg_24">p. 24</ref>.</note>
                            was prepared at the Embassy embodying the revised ideas which had
                            developed as a result of this discussion. This memorandum was submitted
                            to Mr. Vergara yesterday, who stated that it represented substantially
                            the basis of an exchange agreement satisfactory to Chile. He added that
                            obviously the wording of portions of the memorandum were too discursive
                            and explanatory in nature to be used as the final text of an agreement
                            but that he felt that in substance the two governments were virtually in
                            agreement if the memorandum represented also a basis for an agreement
                            acceptable to the United States Government.</p>
                        <p>In explanation of the departures in the draft of the Memorandum dated
                            March 27th from the Embassy’s Memorandum of March [<hi rend="italic"
                                >February?</hi>] 20th, originally submitted, the following may be
                            stated concerning each point.</p>
                        <p>1. It will be noticed that the first sentence of point No. 1 has been
                            changed to read that the Chilean Government agrees to lift “as soon as
                            possible” all exchange control, etc. The insertion of this phrase was
                            felt necessary because the Foreign Office feels that enabling
                            legislation will be necessary to put on a strictly legal basis the
                            lifting of the exchange control provided for in the agreement. While at
                            first glance there may appear to be some objection to this, actually it
                            is not believed that the point is of great importance since the Minister
                            of Finance can and will give full effect to the agreement pending the
                            time when the new exchange situation can be regularized through
                            appropriate legislation.</p>
                        <p>The next change which was made was in the deletion of the second sentence
                            of point No. 1. Our discussions with Mr. Vergara brought out the fact
                            that he entertained surprisingly strong objections to making any
                            reference to sources of exchange other than the export draft market. He
                            insisted that the only source of exchange controlled by the Government
                            is the export draft market and to include reference to other sources
                            would lead to great difficulties both because of internal legal
                            considerations as well as in connection with Chile’s relations with
                            other countries on exchange questions. He maintained that from our point
                            of view it is not a practical consideration since if the commerce <pb
                                n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0086"/>of the United States and Great
                            Britain are placed on a free exchange basis, the unofficial sources of
                            exchange are thus virtually done away with. The reasons for the strong
                            objections entertained by the Under Secretary are not completely
                            apparent, but it is felt that a satisfactory solution to this point can
                            be reached by omitting the sentence embodying this reference. Such an
                            omission leaves the commitment made by the Chilean Government to give us
                            exchange free of restriction or control, fully as strong and unqualified
                            and there would not appear to be any great loss from our point of view
                            in meeting the Chilean Government’s wishes on this point.</p>
                        <p>Paragraph 2 of point No. 1 of the modified Memorandum is largely
                            explanatory in character and presumably would not appear in this form in
                            the final agreement. It was set forth in this Memorandum following the
                            language employed in the Memorandum from the Chilean Foreign Office in
                            order that there should be no misunderstanding as to the manner in which
                            the rates would be determined. In our discussion of the rates of
                            exchange the Under Secretary pointed out that as the amounts retained in
                            compensation offices for imports into Chile are in effect the property
                            of private individuals, the situation might arise in which these
                            individuals would agree privately to an exchange rate lower than the
                            rate fixed by the Government and that therefore in any agreement which
                            might be reached the Government would have to note this exception,
                            limiting its commitment to this extent. This point, in the Embassy’s
                            opinion, is not of great practical importance. It is obvious that a
                            situation, though unlikely, might arise where private transactions would
                            be made at rates different than the official rate. The bulk of exchange,
                            however, arising through compensation agreements, is obtained from the
                            sale of nitrates. As the Chilean Government can fully control the rate
                            of exchange obtained through this source, it is felt that American
                            commerce would be fully protected from discriminatory exchange rates if
                            the Chilean Government would guarantee that any exchange created through
                            the sale of nitrate would not be sold at rates lower than the equivalent
                            of the export draft rate. For this reason a proviso to this effect was
                            inserted as the last sentence of the last paragraph under point No.
                            1.</p>
                        <p>2. In discussing point No. 2, Mr. Vergara insisted that it would be
                            unwise to make a reference to the exclusion of purchasers of goods from
                            compensation countries from other sources of exchange. The question
                            involved here is the same point which was discussed under point No. 1,
                            namely the opposition of the Chilean Government to a reference to other
                            sources of exchange. Mr. Vergara again pointed out that the Government
                            can control the export draft market but cannot control these other
                            extra-legal markets. Furthermore, from his knowledge of the attitude of
                            other countries who have negotiated compensation agreements, he stated
                            that he felt sure that a reference of <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21"
                                facs="0087"/>this sort would provoke retaliatory measures on the
                            part of other countries who would then begin to raise their blockage
                            quotas, perhaps even up to 100%, on Chilean nitrate. In our discussion
                            on this point, it was pointed out that such an attitude on the part of
                            compensation countries would be entirely unreasonable since whatever
                            advantages we might be obtaining under the proposed agreement for free
                            exchange were at the cost of the United States’ foregoing the advantages
                            obtained under compensation arrangements, advantages which these nations
                            were now enjoying to our detriment. The Under Secretary did not deny the
                            force of this argument but pointed out that it might be unwise to invite
                            retaliatory measures on the part of compensation countries, which would
                            be very harmful to American commerce as well as Chilean, when the point
                            was of no real practical importance. It was of no practical importance
                            for the reason that even though an attempt were made in an international
                            agreement to dry up extralegal sources of exchange for countries within
                            the compensation system, such attempts would not be effective since
                            experience had proved that legal obstacles notwithstanding, there will
                            always exist a bootleg market when the need for exchange is sufficiently
                            strong. He confirmed our previous understanding that Chile would,
                            however, exclude compensation countries from access to the export draft
                            market.</p>
                        <p>It is obvious that Chile is very anxious to avoid taking any step which
                            might invite further bullying tactics on the part of European countries.
                            While recognizing the very fair treatment which it is obtaining from the
                            United States in regard to the sale of its nitrate, Chile is fearful of
                            losing any of its European nitrate markets. It is of course perfectly
                            true that no international engagement will serve to eradicate the
                            bootleg market or exchange if a real need exists for such a market and
                            in view of the doubtful practical value of attempting to make reference
                            to markets for exchange which are not controllable by the Chilean
                            Government, it is felt that the reference to other sources of exchange
                            at the end of point No. 2 might be omitted without prejudice to the
                            agreement from the American point of view.</p>
                        <p>3. Point No. 3 occasioned more discussion than any other point. The
                            Chilean Government apparently read more into the point than had been
                            intended and insisted on drawing the Embassy into discussions of the
                            details of possible arrangements which might be entered into between
                            American holders of frozen credits and the Chilean Government. It was
                            pointed out to the Under Secretary that the primary desire was that an
                            agreement on exchange facilities should not be later on invoked by the
                            Chilean Government as closing the door to advantageous private
                            arrangements on the part of American firms or individuals to liquidate
                            their frozen credits; that it might be possible, for example, for these
                            creditors or groups of them <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0088"/>to
                            work out arrangements on exchange matters over a period of time at rates
                            more advantageous than the prevailing free market rates and that we
                            would wish the Chilean Government to give sympathetic consideration to
                            any such proposals. The Under Secretary appeared to feel that somehow
                            this statement involved a definite commitment as to the point of view of
                            the Chilean Government which might prove embarrassing or untenable later
                            on. After much discussion, however, he finally agreed to accept point
                            No. 3 without change of wording as originally embodied in the Embassy’s
                            Memorandum.</p>
                        <p>4. The Under Secretary had apparently been impressed with the seriousness
                            with which the American Government viewed the question of relief for
                            Americans having deposits in the retirement fund and appeared to view
                            favorably a provision following the lines of point No. 4 in the modified
                            Memorandum. It will be noted that following this provision the Chilean
                            Government would agree to repay Americans having dollar deposits when
                            such payments are due. The reason this language was inserted was because
                            the law governing the repayment of these deposits contains certain
                            conditions governing the time at which they are to be repaid; for
                            example, one provision provides for the repayment of depositors after
                            they have been outside of Chile for a period of one year. It is felt
                            that if the Chilean Government is willing to agree to point No. 4 as now
                            worded, we will obtain a more satisfactory arrangement in regard to
                            these payments than has heretofore seemed possible. It will be noted
                            that the language of the new point No. 4 shifts the burden of payment to
                            a definite obligation on the part of the Government rather than on the
                            part of the Caja which does not have funds available to meet these
                            payments.</p>
                        <p>There have been indicated above the changes in phraseology of the
                            proposal drafted by the Embassy which the Chilean Government feels are
                            essential to make it acceptable. In my opinion, these changes do not
                            represent an attempt to offer us less than contemplated in the original
                            proposal. Rather they are due to the development of certain practical or
                            legal difficulties in putting the proposal into operation which were not
                            entirely foreseen at the time when the general principle of the granting
                            of exchange free from all control was suggested. It is not believed that
                            in meeting the wishes of the Chilean Government the substance of the
                            agreement, from the American point of view, will be lost. Indeed, in
                            some respects the amended proposal represents a more concrete and
                            satisfactory draft than that of the Embassy Memorandum of February 20th.
                            Therefore, unless the Department perceives objections which are not
                            apparent to the Embassy, it is recommended that the Memorandum of March
                            27th be accepted as embodying the general terms of a satisfactory
                            proposal following closely the lines of the Department’s telegraphic
                            instruction <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0089"/>No. 21 of February
                            17, 2 p.m., 1934. It should be understood of course, that in tentatively
                            accepting the Memorandum referred to above, the Under Secretary made it
                            clear that for the sake of conciseness, if for no other reason, there
                            would be certain changes in the text and that his Government was not to
                            be considered as accepting absolutely textually the Memorandum as it
                            stands. He added, however, that if the Memorandum were acceptable to the
                            Department, there appeared to be practically no divergence in any
                            essential points between the two governments. On our side it was made
                            clear that no definite assurance could be given as to the Department’s
                            viewpoint thereon.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing I have the honor to request that the Embassy be
                            informed by telegram whether the Department desires it to proceed on the
                            above basis to work out a draft of an exchange of notes, subject to the
                            Department’s approval, such an exchange of notes to constitute a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> in regard to exchange matters
                            between the two governments pending the time when a definitive
                            commercial treaty can be concluded.</p>
                        <p>In recommending the acceptance of the above proposal the Embassy desires
                            to make it clear that it feels the proposal is about the best we can
                            obtain, all conditions being considered. It is believed that it
                            satisfactorily takes care of the requirements for our current trade,
                            certainly within the limited external purchasing power which we may
                            anticipate in Chile for the next few years. We must frankly face the
                            fact, however, that such an agreement does not very satisfactorily solve
                            the problem of American frozen credits which at the best we can
                            anticipate will be transferred at approximately the prevailing export
                            draft rate. Obviously liquidations of frozen accounts at this rate
                            represent an acceptance of a loss on the part of American business firms
                            involved ranging up to 66⅔%. Local American firms realize that they
                            cannot hope to obtain rates comparable to the official rate of exchange
                            obtaining through compensation agreements. They do feel, however, that
                            in all fairness, they should be able to liquidate their back accounts at
                            rates substantially more favorable than the prevailing export draft
                            rate.</p>
                        <p>Our discussions with the Foreign Office have made it apparent that the
                            Chilean Government will not be disposed to enter into arrangements with
                            private firms for the transfer of their frozen assets at preferential
                            rates. While the Embassy will of course lend its good offices in any
                            proper way toward assisting American firms in reaching a favorable
                            arrangement, it is not believed that the Chilean Government will grant
                            favorable rates of exchange unless the American Government is disposed
                            to assert very strong pressure.</p>

                            <p>1. The Chilean Government agrees to lift as soon as possible all
                                exchange control and trade restrictions as concerns American
                                commerce and interests. This means that individuals or firms
                                desiring to make remittances or to effect other transactions with
                                the United States would be able to do so freely without restriction
                                or control. The requests of persons seeking foreign exchange to pay
                                for current purchases of American goods would be honored at the
                                most-favored-nation rate of exchange to the extent that such foreign
                                exchange might be available. In this connection the Chilean
                                Government, in conformity with the oral assurances already given,
                                would guarantee that as regards current and future purchases abroad
                                there would be no discrimination in exchange rates as between the
                                United States and other countries, including those having
                                compensation agreements.</p>
                            <p>In order to prevent the discrimination which would result from the
                                existence of different exchange rates with other countries, arising
                                from the control of commerce which originates the establishment of
                                compensation offices, the Government fixed the rate of exchange at
                                which there must be sold the amounts withheld by the compensation
                                offices and set aside for the import of merchandise into Chile, at
                                250% of the official rate of exchange; this surcharge will be
                                modified if the present exchange conditions vary. In this matter it
                                equalized all rates of exchange for the amounts subject to
                                compensation, and fixed a surcharge which establishes equivalency
                                between those rates and that which obtains at the present time for
                                the United States in the export draft market.</p>
                            <p>The Chilean Government points out that the amounts retained in the
                                compensation offices to be used for imports into Chile are the
                                property of private individuals and that it could happen that these
                                individuals might agree privately to exchange transactions at rates
                                lower than those fixed by the Government. However, notwithstanding,
                                the Chilean Government will make every effort to endeavor to
                                maintain equivalency in the rates and it agrees to guarantee that
                                any exchange created through the sale of nitrate or other products
                                by the Nitrate Sales Corporation will not be sold at rates lower
                                than the equivalent of the export draft rate.</p>
                            <p>2. The Government agrees that purchasers of merchandise from
                                countries having compensation agreements with Chile, shall not be
                                accorded legal access to the export draft market.</p>
                            <p>3. The Government agrees to give sympathetic consideration, within
                                the spirit of the foregoing and bearing in mind that the United
                                States does not discriminate against the commerce of Chile, to any
                                    <pb n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0091"/>private proposals which
                                subsequently may be made by American commercial interests with a
                                view to concluding an equitable agreement for the liquidation of
                                frozen credits.</p>
                            <p>4. With regard to Americans having dollar deposits in the Caja de
                                Previsión de Empleados Particulares, the Chilean Government agrees
                                to repay such depositors in dollars when payments to them become
                                due. Furthermore, the Government agrees to repay in dollars at the
                                official rate of exchange the American holders of peso accounts
                                residing outside of Chile.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to this
                            Embassy’s despatch No. 77 of March 28, 1934, reporting the progress of
                            our negotiations concerning an agreement on exchange and to report the
                            situation of the British in regard to their exchange problems.</p>
                        <p>For the time being the British negotiations have reached somewhat of an
                            impasse due to the fact that, while the British are insisting upon a
                            full acceptance of the general principle of freedom from exchange
                            control, on its side the Chilean Government is unwilling to sign a
                            formal agreement on the principle until it shall have received a
                            detailed statement of the amount of funds which the British desire to
                            transfer and the names of the companies and individuals involved. It
                            appears that the British Embassy, some weeks ago, submitted a global
                            amount representing an estimate of British frozen credits, but the
                            Minister of Finance refused to accept this figure, stating that it was
                            far too large. The real difficulty is due to the fact that the British
                            problem is somewhat different than ours. In our case the frozen credits
                            are represented by actual cash in pesos, by very liquid assets which can
                            be converted quickly into pesos, or by accounts which are owed in
                            dollars but where both the debtor and the creditor are Americans, for
                            example, the dollars owed by American concerns such as the electric
                            light company or the telephone company to pay service charges on their
                            bonded indebtedness or for supplies and other dollar obligations. In
                            addition to these there are dollar accounts which are owed by Chileans,
                            but these are a relatively small percentage of the total. The British,
                            on the other hand, are faced with the problem of repatriating a
                            relatively large amount of sterling obligations which are owed by
                            Chilean debtors. These debtors, shielding themselves behind the text of
                            the monetary <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0092"/>law, refuse to
                            settle their sterling accounts except on the basis of supplying pesos to
                            cover at the official rate of exchange, namely, about 50 pesos to the
                            pound, instead of purchasing exchange in the open market at around 120
                            pesos to the pound. Specifically, the British Embassy estimates British
                            frozen assets as follows: <table rows="3" cols="3"

                        <p>The Minister of Finance has endeavored to secure from British banks and
                            the British Embassy a list of the funds whose transfer is desired, but
                            it is understood that comparatively few of these transfers have been
                            made, chiefly due to the fact that, unlike American creditors, the
                            British are unwilling to accept a liquidation of their accounts at the
                            current export draft rate.</p>
                        <p>Although the Foreign Office has been prodding the British Embassy to
                            secure a formal acceptance of the principle of free exchange by the
                            Chilean Government, the Embassy is inclined to be complacent about the
                            present situation. The logic of events here has brought it to virtually
                            the same conclusion which we have also reached, namely that the <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation is not an unfavorable one,
                            since: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) current commerce can obtain ample
                            exchange to cover its needs and to take care of any reasonable expansion
                            due to better world conditions; in this respect exchange availabilities
                            being better for us than for countries limited by compensation treaties;
                                (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) frozen assets can be freely repatriated
                            at the current export draft rate, thus providing for a quicker
                            liquidation, though at a much less favorable rate than in the case of
                            compensation countries. Although British creditors appear to be more
                            hopeful of obtaining a better rate than the current market rate for the
                            liquidation of frozen assets, the British Embassy shares this Embassy’s
                            view that preferential rates for this purpose could only be obtained
                            should Great Britain decide to enter into compensation or blockage
                            arrangements, a policy which that Government does not care to pursue. As
                            stated above, the most serious problem which the British have is to find
                            a fair solution for the settlement of the million pounds sterling
                            accounts.</p>
                        <p>This Embassy will of course continue to report any matters of interest
                            developing in the exchange situation, but is not anticipating taking the
                            question up again with the Foreign Office, pending the receipt of the
                            Department’s instructions after it has had time to give consideration to
                            the Embassy’s despatch No. 77.</p>

                        <p>35. Your despatch No. 77, March 28. The Department will shortly send you
                            a further instruction on this subject. It desires first to have from you
                            an interpretation of the first sentence in item No. 1 of the memorandum
                            (enclosure No. 2 of despatch referred to). Does this mean in your
                            understanding and in the understanding of the Chilean Government that
                            exporters in Chile who acquire dollars by sales in the United States
                            will be free to dispose of those dollars wherever and however they
                            desire without the intervention of the exchange control? Under this
                            arrangement would the requirement be retained which Department
                            understands exists at present whereunder foreign producers of minerals
                            must remit to the exchange control a certain percentage of the proceeds
                            of all their sales? Also would any percentage of the proceeds of nitrate
                            sales to the United States be blocked for special purposes, thereby
                            preventing their reaching the free market? If these requirements are
                            still to be retained what percentage of proceeds of sales of such
                            producers will be freely disposable? Purpose of this inquiry is to make
                            sure that this Government and the Chilean Government have the same
                            understanding of the terms used in this sentence.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my despatch
                            No. 86 of April 11, 1934, and to report the following developments.</p>
                        <p>Continuing its policy of encouraging the transfer of American frozen
                            credits, the Ministry of Hacienda arranged last week with the Control
                            Commission for the transfer of certain American funds on deposit with
                            the National City Bank. These deposits represented accounts with the
                            Bank and drafts which had been collected in pesos which heretofore could
                            not be legally transferred. In all, approximately 470,000 dollars worth
                            of transfers were effected at the rate of 25 pesos to the dollar. It had
                            been expected that about a million dollars would be moved, but the
                            Minister of Finance did not wish to send the rate of exchange too high
                            and therefore closed down on further transfers for the time being. It is
                            planned, however, to continue to effect these transfers as exchange
                            becomes available through the returns made from the sale of nitrate or
                            from other sources.</p>
                        <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0094"/>
                        <p>While the Chilean Government has offered the same facilities to British
                            interests, up to now practically no British funds have been repatriated.
                            As has been pointed out, the difficulty is largely due to the fact that
                            their frozen credits are not in as liquid condition as are the American
                            credits. Furthermore, they represent in great part debts owed by
                            Chileans to British firms and the Chilean debtors are unwilling to
                            purchase the necessary funds at open market rates. The British Embassy
                            states that it is anticipated that about a million pesos will be
                            transferred within the next few days. From the diplomatic angle no
                            progress on the part of the British appears to have been made. They
                            still hope to effect a satisfactory agreement through an exchange of
                            notes which will include provisions offering a solution to their problem
                            of making their Chilean debtors pay sterling debts in effective sterling
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of obtaining adequate relief for Americans who have
                            retirement funds with the Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares,
                            the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation of exchange seems
                            satisfactory from our point of view. Enough exchange is available to
                            purchase such American goods as can be sold and as long as the present
                            policy of the Chilean Government continues, American frozen credits are
                            being slowly liquidated. At least, if the <hi rend="italic">de
                                facto</hi> situation is not entirely satisfactory to us neither is
                            it to compensation countries. In a recent conversation, Count de
                            Sartiges, the French Minister here, stated that he was very dissatisfied
                            with the way the French compensation treaty<note n="12" xml:id="d22fn12"
                                >Signed November 11, 1932, <hi rend="italic">Journal Officiel de la
                                    République Française</hi>, November 22, 1932, p. 12164.</note>
                            was working out and that he felt that the American approach to the
                            problem was sounder than the French; that the opportunity for the sale
                            of French merchandise to Chile was greatly restricted due to the
                            compensation treaty. As France bullied Chile into the compensation
                            treaty there is a certain poetic justice in laments of the French
                            Minister.</p>

                        <p>38. In view of the considerations set forth in your despatch No. 77 of
                            March 28, 1934, and of the interpretation thereof supplied by the
                            Chilean Government in your telegram No. 44, May 8, 6 p.m., this
                            Government is disposed to accept the revised memorandum in substance as
                            a basis for an agreement. Accordingly, you may formulate in consultation
                            with the Chilean authorities a draft text of the proposed agreement,
                            which should be submitted to the Department for approval before
                            signature. Since the arrangement is in a sense experimental it should
                            contain a provision for termination on short notice, either 15 or 30
                            days.</p>
                        <p>You should at the same time submit a memorandum to the Chilean Government
                            referring to point 3 defining “an equitable agreement for the
                            liquidation of frozen credits” and stating that this Government desires
                            to make clear that in view of the fact that the United States does not
                            discriminate against Chilean commerce it expects that its nationals will
                            receive, as regards the liquidation of their frozen credits in Chile,
                            treatment no less favorable than that granted to the nationals of any
                            other country.</p>
                        <p>For your information, the purpose of this statement is to put on record
                            this Government’s position regarding the interpretation to be placed
                            upon point 3 of the agreement.</p>

                        <p>41. Your 46, May 24, 5 p.m. Obviously this Government cannot be a party
                            to any agreement which authorizes either expressly or impliedly
                            discrimination against American nationals. It was precisely for this
                            reason that the Department felt it necessary to place on record with the
                            Chilean Government its position as set out in the memorandum mentioned
                            in Department’s 38, May 22, 7 p.m., and consequently the Department
                            cannot modify the memorandum in the sense suggested by the Chilean
                            Foreign Office.</p>

                        <p>50. Department’s No. 41, June 1, 7 p.m. Insistence upon making the
                            memorandum mentioned in the Department’s telegram 38, May 22, 7 p.m.
                            part of the agreement of course will result automatically in breaking
                            off negotiations along the present lines since it involves a commitment
                            by the Chilean Government which it is not in a position to make. The
                            liquidation of frozen credits at exchange rates no less favorable than
                            those granted to the nationals of any other country can be obtained only
                            by the conclusion of a compensation treaty which the Chilean Government
                            has always been willing to do.</p>
                        <p>On the question of discrimination the Chilean position is that the
                            agreement would do away with the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                            discrimination which we complain of as resulting from compensation
                            treaties since much greater <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0097"
                            />exchange would be available for our commerce than for that of
                            countries held strictly within the limits of availabilities obtained
                            through compensation.</p>
                        <p>As the Department was frankly informed in paragraph 4 my telegram No. 7,
                            January 19, 4 p.m., and subsequent correspondence the proposed
                            arrangement would not in itself provide for the liquidation of frozen
                            credits at preferential rates. No further action will be taken pending
                            receipt of the Department’s instructions.</p>

                            now have the honor to report that under date of May 30, 1934, that
                            Institution informed its depositors holding accounts in sterling of
                            American gold that in exercise of the authority conferred upon it by
                            Article 13 of Law No. 5107 of April 19, 1932,<note n="19"

                                    Chile</hi>, April 19, 1932, pp. 986, 987.</note> it had
                            converted their deposits into pesos on May 18, 1934, at the rate of
                            exchange, namely 9.60 pesos to the dollar, fixed by the Central Bank of
                            Chile on that day. In view of this arbitrary and unilateral action by
                            the Caja and the fact that this question has been and still is the
                            subject of diplomatic negotiations with the Chilean Government, it was
                            deemed necessary to request the Foreign Office to rescind the action
                            taken by the Caja pending such time as the two governments might reach
                            an agreement. A copy of my note is transmitted herewith.</p>
                        <p>The Department will observe that the request of the Embassy for the
                            rescission of the measures taken by the Caja to convert these funds
                            without the consent of the depositors is based exclusively on the fact
                            that the question is still the subject of diplomatic negotiations
                            between the two governments. In view of this fact it did not seem wise
                            to complicate the negotiations at this time by entering into a technical
                            discussion of the legal features involved. For the Department’s
                            information it may be well, however, to review this phase of the
                            subject. The pertinent Chilean legislation on this question is found in

                                <p>“Article 13 converts the deposits in foreign money of the Caja de
                                    Previsión de Empleados Particulares into Chilean pesos. Many
                                    Americans employed in Chile have been required by law to deposit
                                    a percentage of their salary in the Caja and some of them have
                                    accepted a lower rate of interest in order to have their
                                    deposits in foreign currency. For them, therefore, the
                                    conversion of these deposits into Chilean pesos is a real
                                    hardship, especially in the cases of persons who have left the
                                    country.”</p>

                            5107 was approved by the Chilean Congress but had not yet been signed by
                            the President. In view of the representations on this point and because
                            of other objectionable features in the proposed law, it was vetoed by
                            the President and returned to Congress (see Enclosure No. 1, Despatch
                            1144, April 20, 1932).<note n="21" xml:id="d30fn21">Despatch and its

                            that a paragraph be added which would take into account the situation of
                            foreign employees who had left the country or who for any other reasons
                            preferred to maintain their deposits in the currency in which they had
                            been made. The proposed paragraph was as follows: <quote

                                <p>“The deposits of foreign employees who do not wish to accept the

                        <p>The Senate in rejecting this proposed amendment (see Enclosure No. 3,
                            Despatch No. 1144 of April 20, 1932) states: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    contemplating this idea in the law…”</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">After overriding the President’s veto with respect to
                            the provision of the bill the then Minister of Hacienda published a
                            statement which reads in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… The second modification (of the President’s veto message)
                                    refers to foreign employees who have deposited savings in gold
                                    at the Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares and who, by
                                    reason of their having left the country or for any other reason
                                    whatsoever, might not find it advantageous to have their
                                    deposits converted into local currency. The Senate considers
                                    that the exception which the Executive proposed is not necessary
                                    and, if it can be achieved without modifying the law, so much
                                    the better.…”</p>

                        <p>It will be observed from the foregoing that in 1932 when the monetary
                            bill was first passed by the Chilean Congress, both the Embassy and the
                            Chilean Executive considered that Article 13 as worded could be
                            interpreted as conferring upon the Caja authority to make the
                            conversions with or without the consent of the depositors affected; that
                            in order to dispel any such interpretation the Executive attempted to
                            have the law modified in such a manner as to indicate clearly that the
                            contemplated operation could be effected only with the consent of the
                            interested depositors; and that from the statements made by the Senate
                            and by the then Minister of Hacienda, Article 13 as originally drafted
                            and subsequently passed by the Congress, was apparently intended to
                            grant authority to the Caja to make the conversion only with the consent
                            of the depositors concerned.</p>
                        <p>This question has been discussed with a prominent Chilean attorney who
                            holds that the deposits of American citizens in dollars with the Caja de
                            Previsión de Empleados Particulares is a bilateral contract. <pb n="35"
                                xml:id="pg_35" facs="0101"/>From this it follows in his opinion that
                            while Article 13 of Law 5107 confers upon the Caja authority to convert
                            such deposits into local currency with the surcharge corresponding to
                            the date on which such conversion is made, the operation itself can be
                            effected only if the depositor consents to the conversion inasmuch as
                            bilateral contracts under Chilean law can be modified only with the
                            agreement of both parties.</p>
                        <p>Until May 30, 1934, the authority to convert the foreign currency funds
                            had never been availed of. In discussing the problem of the repayment of
                            these funds reference has been made to the authorization contained in
                            the Law and at times there has been a veiled threat that the Caja might
                            carry the provision into effect. On these occasions the attention of the
                            authorities has been invited to the history of the legislation in
                            question from which it would appear to be clearly indicated that the
                            intent of Congress as well as of the Executive at that time was that
                            depositors could not be forced to accept conversions but that such
                            conversions could be made by the Caja with the consent of the
                            depositors.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the negotiations for an exchange agreement ways and
                            means of effecting such payment have been discussed but at no time did
                            the authorities suggest that the Caja might exercise unilaterally the
                            authority conferred upon it by Article 13 of Law No. 5107. The
                            determination of the Caja as set forth in the copy of its circular
                            enclosed herewith<note n="22" xml:id="d30fn22">Not printed.</note>
                            comes, therefore, as a complete surprise and it is the belief of the
                            Embassy that the action was taken without consultation with the Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs. However, on the other hand, it is obvious that the
                            measure has the approval of Mr. Ross, the Minister of Hacienda, since he
                            is ex officio the President of that institution.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware the Embassy has always felt that the treatment
                            accorded American depositors in the Caja de Previsión de Empleados
                            Particulares has been clearly unjust and that these worthy cases should
                            have the full support of the American Government. It is the Embassy’s
                            understanding that the Department fully concurs in this view. The
                            Embassy proposes, therefore, to continue to impress the Foreign Office
                            with the position which has been taken that a satisfactory solution of
                            this question must form an integral part of any general agreement which
                            may be entered into concerning American trade and interests in
                            Chile.</p>

                                Excellency that I am in receipt of a communication from an American
                                citizen, protesting against the recent action taken by the Caja de
                                Previsión de Empleados Particulares in informing depositors having
                                dollar accounts with that institution that on May 18, 1934, it had
                                converted their deposits into pesos at a rate of 9.60 pesos to the
                                dollar. A copy of the circular issued by the Caja is enclosed.</p>
                            <p>While it does not appear necessary at this time to enter into a
                                technical discussion of the legal aspects of this unilateral and
                                arbitrary action by the Caja in a matter involving bilateral
                                obligations and rights, I do desire to remind Your Excellency that a
                                satisfactory solution of the problem of American citizens who are
                                depositors in the Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares has
                                always formed an integral part of the negotiations which are being
                                carried on between the Government of the United States and the
                                Government of Chile in connection with an exchange agreement.</p>
                            <p>As Your Excellency will recall it has always been made clear in all
                                our discussions that the American Government considers that any
                                satisfactory agreement concerning American commerce and interests in
                                Chile should include an understanding providing for an effective
                                repayment of the retirement accounts held by American depositors in
                                the Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares, such an
                                understanding either to be embodied in the text of an agreement or
                                arrived at by means of separate exchange of notes at the time of
                                reaching a general agreement. That the Chilean Government, being
                                aware of the special interest which this matter holds for the
                                American Government, has been willing to consider negotiations
                                concerning the Caja as an integral part of the general negotiations
                                on exchange matters, is clearly evidenced by the fact that from the
                                earliest stages of the negotiations the question of the Caja has
                                been included in all the conversations which have taken place. This
                                question it will be remembered was the subject of a special
                                paragraph in the Memorandum of January 3, 1934,<note n="23"

                                basis for an exchange agreement. This Memorandum contained the

                                Previsión de Empleados Particulares: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“4. With regard to Americans having dollar deposits in the
                                        Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares, the Chilean
                                        Government agrees to repay such depositors in dollars when
                                        payments to them become due. Furthermore, the Government
                                        agrees to repay in dollars at the official rate of exchange
                                        the American holders of peso accounts residing outside of

                                between the two Governments, I can only conclude that the unilateral
                                action of the Caja to which I have reference was taken without
                                consultation with Your Excellency. I have the honor, therefore, to
                                request that Your Excellency be good enough to insure that the
                                action taken by the Caja in converting the funds of American
                                citizens at a rate of exchange lower than the recognized commercial
                                rate, be rescinded pending such time as an agreement shall have been
                                reached between the two Governments on this subject.</p>

                        <p>61. Your despatch No. 152, July 18, 1934. Your action thoroughly
                            approved. Please keep this matter actively before the Chilean government
                            and request the recision of the arbitrary and unilateral action taken by
                            the Caja, which was contrary not only to the terms of the agreement
                            under which the deposits were made but also to the assurance given by
                            the Minister of Hacienda as well as members of the Senate when law 5107
                            was passed. You may say that this government hopes that the Chilean
                            Government will make a prompt and generous settlement of this
                            long-standing problem, in view of the humanitarian considerations
                            involved and the relative insignificance <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38"

                            have arrived at Santiago. Department desires you to discuss this matter
                            thoroughly with them. It would be glad to have the report on the present
                            financial situation of the Caja, so as to be in a position to judge its
                            ability to satisfy the claims of Americans against it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s instruction
                            No. 52, July 5, 1934, concerning the visit of Dr. John H. Williams of
                            the New York Federal Reserve Board and Mr. Donald R. Heath of the State
                            Department to study exchange conditions in Chile and other Latin
                            American countries, I have the honor to submit the following report.</p>
                        <p>The Financial Mission augmented by Mr. Eric Lamb<note n="25"
                                xml:id="d32fn25">Of the Federal Reserve Bank.</note> arrived at the
                            airport at 4:30 P.M. on August 4th. The next day, Sunday, was devoted to
                            resting from the trip and studying the memoranda and other material
                            which the Embassy had prepared for use in discussing exchange problems.
                            In view of the extremely limited time which these gentlemen could spend
                            in Santiago, it was deemed desirable first to have a full round-table
                            discussion with the members of the staff in order that the Mission might
                            obtain all possible information from the Embassy; second, to hold
                            interviews with the more important representatives of American business
                            in Santiago including both those individuals who might be expected to
                            favor pushing for special treatment on frozen credits, those who because
                            of the interests of their companies might be expected to oppose such a
                            policy, and those who presumably would have a broad neutral view of the
                            situation. Following the interviews with the Americans it was felt that
                            the Mission should be presented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                            hold an interview with Mr. Ross, the Minister of Hacienda, who is a
                            controlling factor in the Chilean policy of exchange and subsequently as
                            time permitted meet members of the Chilean Foreign Office, officials of
                            the Central Bank and other prominent individuals. Dr. Williams being in
                            entire accord with this procedure, on Monday morning a session took
                            place at the Embassy and in the afternoon discussions were held with Mr.
                            Leo Welch, the manager of the National City Bank in Santiago, and Mr.
                            George S. Laing, manager of the West India Oil Company, a subsidiary of
                            the Standard Oil Company of <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0105"/>New
                            Jersey. The next day the following individuals were interviewed: Mr.
                            Philip Bonsai of the International Telephone and Telegraph, Mr. J. F.
                            Owens of the Compañía Eléctrica, Mr. Percy Seibert, of the Braden Copper
                            Company and Mr. Edward Craig, of Anaconda Copper Company, Mr. Horace
                            Graham, Director of the Compañía de Ventas de Salitre and Mr. Paul
                            Miller, Controlor of that Company. On Thursday morning a discussion was
                            held with Mr. Arthur J. Pack, the Commercial Secretary of the British
                            Embassy who outlined in some detail the experience of the British in
                            liquidating frozen accounts. At 11 o’clock Dr. Williams accompanied by
                            Mr. Scotten and Mr. Scott of the Embassy had a long interview with the
                            Minister of Hacienda. A memorandum giving a report of the conversation
                            which took place is enclosed. Later in the morning, the members of the
                            Financial Mission were presented to Dr. Cruchaga, the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, and subsequently had a conversation with Mr. Germán
                            Vergara, the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. On Thursday afternoon,
                            through the kindness of Mr. Bohan, the Commercial Attaché, a reception
                            was given at Mr. Bohan’s house where an opportunity was afforded for
                            meeting the following officials of the Central Bank and other important
                            Chileans: Sr. Guillermo Subercaseaux, President of the Central Bank of
                            Chile, Dr. Luis Schmidt, Vice President of the Central Bank of Chile,
                            Sr. Otto Meyerholtz, General Manager of the Central Bank of Chile, Dr.
                            German Max, Economist of the Central Bank of Chile, Sr. Fernando
                            Mardones, Director of the Budget, Sr. Anibal Alfaro, Director of
                            Municipal Budgets, Sr. Renato Márquezado, Chief, Comptroller General’s
                            office. Friday morning a final discussion and summary of work
                            accomplished occurred at the Embassy in which careful consideration was
                            given to the report of Dr. Williams embodied in the Memorandum dated
                            August 8, a copy of which is enclosed. In view of the very limited time
                            at the disposal of Dr. Williams he was unable to devote any space to the
                            question of the American retirement funds in the Caja de Empleados
                            Particulares. He discussed this problem orally, however, and it will be
                            the subject of a special memorandum.</p>
                        <p>It should be stated that Dr. Williams’ report represents the considered
                            views of the Embassy and the Financial Mission arrived at after a
                            complete discussion and debate on each phase of the subject point by
                            point. As it embodies in final form the combined opinions of the Embassy
                            and the Mission after all points of divergence had been eliminated or
                            compromised, the Embassy is not submitting a separate report but
                            recommends to the Department the favorable consideration of Dr.
                            Williams’ report with which, as above stated, it is in entire
                            concurrence. Pending the receipt of the Department’s instructions after
                            it shall have had an opportunity to study the question with Dr. Williams
                                <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0106"/>in Washington, the Embassy
                            will take no action toward any further negotiations with the Chilean
                            Government on exchange matters.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion the Embassy desires to take this opportunity of expressing
                            its appreciation of the helpfulness of Dr. Williams, Mr. Heath and Mr.
                            Lamb whose efficient and concentrated efforts in Santiago were of great
                            assistance in clarifying the complex exchange situation and were
                            particularly helpful in drawing forth new information which served to
                            throw additional light on the problem of American frozen credits.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Williams opened the interview by alluding in general terms to the
                                economic difficulties which he had found in the Latin-American
                                countries which he had visited and which were due, in his opinion,
                                largely to the drastic decline in prices and consequent falling off
                                of exports and to other causes which were nobody’s fault in
                                particular and beyond the control of the countries involved. Mr.
                                Ross at this point interjected the remark that that was true but did
                                not represent the whole picture of Chile’s difficulties, one side of
                                which was to find sufficient markets for its exports. The United
                                States, for example, was a creditor country, [and although?] wishing
                                to obtain remittance on its debts in Chile [it?] had shut out one of
                                the chief Chilean products from its markets, namely, copper, and
                                therefore it might be said that it was partly to blame for not
                                securing better remittances from Chile since it itself had destroyed
                                a large source of exchange for American needs. Dr. Williams replied
                                that he was inclined to personally agree with Mr. Ross on this point
                                but that the question of copper tariff represented certain political
                                and other considerations in the United States very difficult to
                                overcome.</p>
                            <p>Next, in reply to Dr. Williams’ inquiry concerning the present
                                economic situation in Chile, and what disposition the Minister of
                                Finance might be contemplating making of the excess exchange
                                availabilities which it was understood were now accruing, Mr. Ross
                                outlined his general policy as follows:</p>
                            <p>First, he stated that the general position of Chile was better but
                                that in reality appreciable surpluses of exchange were not being
                                created for the reason that Chile had been living off its own fat,
                                so to speak; <pb n="41" xml:id="pg_41" facs="0107"/>that is, it had
                                been eating up stock of merchandise on hand which would need to be
                                replenished. Imports, therefore, would inevitably have to be
                                increased causing a corresponding drain on exchange availabilities.
                                Speaking in general terms about our treatment on exchange, the
                                Minister endeavored to drive home the point that a preponderant
                                share of exchange created by Chile’s exports came back to the United
                                States. Copper, for example, sold say at 7 to 8 cents in England and
                                of this price 6 cents returned to the United States.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Williams pointed out that this was another problem involving the
                                question of exchange used for financing charges, etc.</p>
                            <p>With regard to his policy concerning the rate at which the peso
                                should be held, the Minister stated that for the time being he would
                                attempt to hold it around its present level of 25 to the dollar;
                                this was necessary because the gold washing industry could not be
                                kept up if the peso appreciated much more than this, nor could
                                agricultural and certain other products be exported at a profit with
                                a higher peso. He added that he was looking toward stabilizing the
                                peso at about this rate with the gold dollar, that is to say, not
                                the old gold dollar but the new gold dollar if or when we went back
                                to a definitely stabilized gold standard.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the long-term bonds, the Minister of Finance stated
                                that he had not reached a final decision in the matter: that nothing
                                could be done for the moment but that he was absolutely clear on one
                                point, namely, that Chile would not sign any agreement whose
                                complete fulfillment could not be clearly foreseen. Having this
                                principle in mind, therefore, he was looking towards a settlement on
                                the bonds which would be in the form of devoting certain dollar or
                                sterling revenues to supply the service on these obligations. These
                                revenues would be derived from the Nitrate Sales Corporation and the
                                bonds would be placed on an income basis, the bondholders only
                                receiving a fluctuating income from the sources of revenue which had
                                been allocated for that purpose. Were an attempt made to settle the
                                long-term bonds on a fixed charge basis, the basis would be so small
                                as to be ridiculous and inacceptable.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Williams next attacked the question of our frozen credits calling
                                attention to the fact that in view of our well-known and traditional
                                policy in regard to insisting upon most-favored-nation treatment,
                                the United States Government had not been inclined to look very
                                complacently upon the granting by Chile of special exchange under
                                compensation treaties to certain countries for the liquidation of
                                their frozen credits; that as a result of his investigation in
                                Chile, he had found that the global amount of American credits in
                                Chile which could be classed as frozen was comparatively small and
                                that in view of these facts it would seem that Chile might make some
                                arrangement <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0108"/>to supply
                                exchange at a preferential rate for the liquidation of these
                                American credits bearing in mind the fact that Chilean products
                                entered the United States free from control and that Chile had a
                                great stake in maintaining and augmenting its nitrate markets in the
                                United States. Dr. Williams added that obviously as the United
                                States had devalorized its dollar by 41% it would not expect
                                liquidation on the basis of the old dollar but that the rate of
                                16.55 pesos to the dollar would perhaps appear a fair one. The
                                Minister of Finance immediately countered by asking if we wanted a
                                compensation treaty similar to the French one. Dr. Williams answered
                                “no”, that such an arrangement tended to canalize trade in narrow
                                channels, would be restrictive and would not be advantageous to
                                either Chile or the United States. “No”, Mr. Ross replied, “it would
                                be disadvantageous to Chile but even more so to the United States.”
                                Mr. Ross then said unequivocally, “We will give you a compensation
                                treaty if you insist upon it to provide exchange at a special rate
                                but if you do not accept compensation, we will not furnish you
                                exchange at a rate lower than the current market rate. This”, he
                                added, “you can accept as a definite decision on my part.”</p>
                            <p>Referring to compensation purely on its own merits the Minister
                                pointed out that were the French scheme adopted it would take years
                                to liquidate American frozen assets. In this connection he referred
                                to the fact that the Germans had become convinced of the
                                disadvantages of the compensation system and had not renewed on June
                                30th their compensation treaty with Chile. Furthermore, he pointed
                                out the fallacy of the theory that special exchange is paid for by
                                the country in which the frozen credits are held. As it has worked
                                out, the funds that supply the special exchange are actually paid
                                for in the country imposing the compensation due to the fact that
                                nitrate is sold in such countries at an artificial price. For
                                example, nitrate is sold in the United States at $25.00 a ton, but
                                in Germany it is sold at $35.00 and in France at $32.00, and at
                                correspondingly high prices in Belgium and Italy. In receiving
                                nitrate quotas for those countries Chile is obliged to agree to sell
                                at no less than these prices. We might say, therefore, that in
                                France the French farmer is paying the cost of the liquidation of
                                the frozen funds of his compatriots at the preferential rate. (<hi
                                    rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: The exact reason for this situation
                                was not made quite clear by the Minister and it was decided to
                                obtain more specific information on this point from the Nitrate
                                Sales Corporation.)</p>
                            <p>Touching for the moment on the relation of the problem of current
                                trade, the Minister points out that exchange availabilities for
                                compensation countries were held down to the amounts created through
                                the compensation agreements. The trade of these countries was
                                correspondingly restricted, therefore, as would be ours were we to
                                insist upon that type of arrangement.</p>
                            <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0109"/>
                            <p>Reverting to the question of our frozen credits, the Minister stated
                                that he felt sure that they were not nearly as large as we had
                                perhaps supposed; that the sum total of these blocked funds had been
                                greatly reduced due to the fact that large amounts had been invested
                                or had been lost; that certain types of funds or investments such as
                                those held by the International Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company
                                and the Compañía Eléctrica, were not properly classifiable as frozen
                                credits. In this connection he referred to his experience with the
                                British; that he had tried to get the British to give him an
                                accurate list of their frozen credits; that the first list supplied
                                had contained enormous sums alleged to be frozen credits; that,
                                however, when it came to the point of finding out exactly how many
                                pesos were in the bank awaiting transfer, the funds had shrunken
                                enormously.</p>
                            <p>In developing the discussion of the frozen credit problem, Dr.
                                Williams stated that of course he could not say what might be the
                                final position taken by the Department in the matter; that, as the
                                Minister was aware, the Department laid great stress on the
                                principle of most-favored-nation treatment and its deeply rooted
                                philosophy in this question might play a strong part in its final
                                decision. Laying this aside for the moment, however, he invited the
                                Minister to make whatever suggestion he cared to towards a practical
                                solution of the frozen credit problem. Mr. Ross replied that while
                                we had been arguing principles, he had been endeavoring to liquidate
                                funds as much as possible so that if the argument of principles
                                continued for a long enough time, a point might be reached where we
                                might agree on principles whose application however would be
                                unnecessary since the problem would have ceased to exist.
                                Specifically, however, the Minister suggested that we follow the
                                same procedure as the English, namely, make a complete list of our
                                frozen credits and all American funds, in fact, available in a
                                completely liquid form desiring transfer. The Minister could then
                                see his exchange problem as a whole and could make suitable
                                arrangements to supply exchange cover over a certain period of time
                                as exchange became available. Peso accounts would present only an
                                exchange problem but in the case of accounts due in dollars he
                                pointed out that the problem was more complicated and some
                                arrangement would have to be made as to finding a suitable rate.
                                Though not entirely clear, the implication was that it would be
                                difficult to force the Chilean debtor to buy sufficient exchange to
                                meet his dollar credits dollar for dollar but that some compromise
                                perhaps would have to be made between creditor and debtor on some
                                intermediate exchange rate.</p>
                            <p>The interview was closed by Dr. Williams and the members of the
                                Embassy staff bringing up the question of the retirement funds of
                                Americans in the Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares and
                                reminding the Minister that a satisfactory settlement of these cases
                                    <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0110"/>was considered
                                indispensable. The Minister stated that he felt it was fair for
                                Chile to pay the funds of Americans residing outside of Chile in
                                full. Americans in Chile, however, he felt could not expect to
                                receive their dollars in full in view of the relative purchasing
                                power of the dollar in Chile to the peso. He asked for a list of
                                depositors and Mr. Scotten showed him a list which he had with him
                                which was transmitted to the Department in despatch No. 78 of March
                                28, 1934.<note n="26" xml:id="d32fn26">Not printed.</note> The
                                Minister was informed that this list had been left months ago at the
                                Foreign Office. Our impression on the Caja matter was that the
                                Minister was disposed to pay the dollar and peso accounts in full to
                                Americans residing outside of Chile but that it would be very
                                difficult to obtain any special treatment for Americans who elected
                                to remain in Chile.</p>

                                    1934</hi></head>
                            <p>During our stay in Chile, we have discussed the American exchange
                                problems in considerable detail with the Embassy staff which, in
                                advance of our arrival, had prepared two important memoranda, one on
                                “Exchange Problems in Chile” and one on “Exchange and Compensation
                                Factors affecting American Trade with Chile”. We then interviewed at

                            <p rend="flushleft">Accompanied by Mr. Scotten and Mr. Scott, I then had
                                an interview of an hour and a quarter with Sr. Gustavo Ross, the
                                Minister of Finance. As the situation stands here, Mr. Ross is the
                                final authority on all economic and financial questions and is his
                                own director of exchange control.</p>
                            <p rend="center">I.</p>
                            <p>There are four possible alternative policies for handling our
                                exchange problems in Chile:</p>
                            <pb n="45" xml:id="pg_45" facs="0111"/>
                            <p>1) By compensation treaty, which would include preferential treatment
                                of frozen credits at the official rate of exchange, which in terms
                                of our old gold dollar would mean 16.55 pesos per U. S. dollar, and
                                in terms of the new gold dollar 9.6 pesos per dollar.</p>
                            <p>2) A general agreement with Chile, along lines already described in
                                the Embassy’s memorandum of March 27, 1934, but including also
                                liquidation of frozen credits on most-favored-nation terms at the
                                official rate of 9.6 to 1. This we understand to have been the State
                                Department’s position. This general agreement would give us freedom
                                from exchange control and an exchange rate on current trade equal to
                                that furnished compensation countries. In addition, by this
                                agreement Chile would undertake to repay in dollars those having
                                dollar deposits in the “Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares”
                                and to furnish dollars at the official rate of exchange to those
                                having peso deposits in the “Caja”.</p>
                            <p>We understand that the Chilean Government has been willing to accept
                                this agreement, in principle, in all respects except for its frozen
                                credits provision; but that the State Department in view of this
                                exception has not gone forward with the agreement, on the ground
                                that to omit the frozen credit provision would represent
                                acquiescence in less than most-favored-nation treatment with respect
                                to this item.</p>
                            <p>3) A general agreement on the lines of (2) above as to current trade
                                and the treatment of American depositors in the “Caja de Previsión”,
                                but with either (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) an agreement to liquidate
                                frozen credits at some other rate of exchange than the official rate
                                of 9.6 to 1, or (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) an understanding that an
                                equitable settlement along these general lines would be effected
                                privately between the Chilean Government and American holders of
                                frozen credits.</p>
                            <p>4) Acceptance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> as to current
                                trade; a definite agreement on the lines already indicated with
                                respect to deposits in the “Caja de Previsión”; and acceptance of
                                the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> as to frozen credits, but with
                                an understanding to be worked out, either by the State Department or
                                privately, as to the best practical method for resolving this
                                problem.</p>
                            <p rend="center">II.</p>
                            <p>In approaching the consideration of these four alternative lines of
                                policy we have borne in mind the long history of negotiations with
                                the Chilean Government concerning our exchange problems, during
                                which time the economic and trade position of Chile has materially
                                changed for the better. This improvement has occurred particularly
                                since the period of active negotiation began last November. Our
                                Government has consistently refused to consider the first plan
                                outlined above, a compensation treaty, on broad grounds of general
                                policy. In pursuing the second alternative, the Department in the
                                    <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0112"/>beginning was evidently
                                much concerned with receiving most-favored-nation treatment with
                                respect to current trade. But partly by reason of the pressure
                                exerted through our Embassy, acting on the Department’s
                                instructions, and in large part, by reason of the general
                                improvement in Chilean trade, this problem has already been resolved
                                without any formal agreement, so that today we are in fact receiving
                                equal treatment with respect to current trade, exchange being made
                                available to our exporters at the export bill rate of 25 to 1 and to
                                the compensation countries at the official rate plus a premium which
                                equalizes the price of exchange as between such countries and
                                ourselves. A formal agreement, therefore, would accomplish nothing
                                more than legalization of the existing <hi rend="italic">status
                                    quo.</hi></p>
                            <p>As the Department has consistently contended, such a formal agreement
                                is unacceptable if not accompanied by an agreement with respect to
                                frozen credits giving us in this respect also most-favored-nation
                                treatment. All of the compensation treaties contain a provision for
                                the liquidation of frozen credits at a rate which is better than the
                                export draft rate now applied to current trade. Our problem has been
                                how to secure equally favorable treatment on frozen credits without
                                consenting to a compensation treaty. If now we should negotiate a
                                general agreement with respect to current trade, and acquiesce in
                                Chile’s refusal to include in it most-favored-nation treatment for
                                our frozen credits, we should apparently be relinquishing what has
                                been, from the beginning of the negotiations, a major contention of
                                principle, for the sake of a general agreement which now can give us
                                little more than the treatment we are already receiving.</p>
                            <p rend="center">III.</p>
                            <p>Our visit to Chile has impressed us with the complicated character of
                                the frozen credits question. It is not easy to determine what would
                                constitute for us most-favored-nation treatment or how desirable
                                such treatment would be if we could get it. The French and other
                                agreements are based on the official rate of exchange (three pence
                                gold); in terms of our devalued dollar this would be 9.6 pesos for 1
                                dollar, but in terms of the old dollar it would be 16.55 to 1. It
                                can be argued that Chile was not responsible for our devaluation and
                                is entitled to consider 16.55 to 1 as its official rate. But to get
                                even this rate, which the Finance Minister firmly refuses except as
                                part of a compensation agreement, it would be necessary to consent
                                to a time schedule which might mean only very gradual liquidation.
                                In the French agreement 20 per cent of nitrate sales to France are
                                blocked to provide exchange for frozen credits, so that unless
                                nitrate sales are large liquidation is slow. A number of the
                                Americans interviewed, <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0113"/>when
                                asked whether they preferred slow liquidation at a good rate or
                                faster liquidation at a worse rate put greater stress upon the
                                latter.</p>
                            <p>To provide exchange at the official rate for frozen credits, Chile
                                compels the Nitrate Sales Corporation to sell exchange at that same
                                rate, instead of at the much more favorable export draft rate. Since
                                the nitrate industry represents largely American capital, such a
                                solution of our frozen credits problem would be at the expense of an
                                American interest. Our nitrate representatives, moreover, point out
                                that since they use a considerable part of their exchange to buy
                                American imports (including oil products, motors, electrical
                                equipment, rubber, etc.), any such attempt to improve the position
                                of American exporters on frozen credits would worsen our position in
                                current trade. It should be pointed out, also, that most of the
                                compensation treaties include only a portion of the frozen credits,
                                so that they do not pretend to provide a complete solution of the
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>To determine an equitable rate for the liquidation of our frozen
                                credits or the amount that would be liquidated were exchange
                                offered, presents great difficulty. Part were frozen in July, 1931,
                                when exchange control was imposed; and when the rate was about 8 to
                                1; but in reporting frozen balances creditors include as well the
                                subsequent accumulations, when the rate was fluctuating from 8 to 60
                                to the dollar. A large portion of the frozen credits, moreover, has
                                been invested in property or in securities, and in some cases large
                                profits have been made. Some credits have been liquidated at the
                                export draft rate, including some 18,000,000 pesos in response to
                                two general offers made by the Finance Minister this year. Some
                                credits are now so tied up that they cannot or will not be
                                liquidated. This part includes 50,000,000 pesos used by Electric
                                Bond and Share to buy up its local 8 per cent debentures, effecting
                                an important saving in interest. It probably should include also
                                18,000,000 pesos of bank deposits belonging to the Telephone
                                Company, which appear to be destined, according to the local
                                representative for investment in Chile, in lieu of new capital from
                                abroad, to carry out expansion in accordance with the company’s
                                contract. Thus of 157,000,000 pesos of “frozen credits” reported to
                                the Commercial Attaché office in response to his questionnaire, our
                                inquiries would indicate that 18,000,000 pesos have been liquidated
                                and at least 68,000,000 pesos cannot or will not be liquidated,
                                leaving a total of about 72,000,000 pesos, which at the current
                                export draft rate is less than $3,000,000. What portion of this was
                                blocked prior to July, 1931, and therefore in equity entitled to the
                                official rate, and what part since that time, when the importer was
                                taking his chances, I am not able to determine. In addition, there
                                are some $4,000,000 of frozen credits in the form of unpaid drafts,
                                receivables, merchandise or other items requiring <pb n="48"
                                    xml:id="pg_48" facs="0114"/>payment by the debtor in dollars.
                                All these, presumably, are in a different category, representing
                                sums not yet collected from the debtor (local importers, etc.). What
                                portion of these debts may still be good, and at what rates the
                                debtors should now be required to provide exchange present difficult
                                problems. But in general, it seems clear that the total amount of
                                collectible or transferable credits is substantially smaller than
                                had previously been supposed. In particular, it should be pointed
                                out that of the total estimated frozen credits (Feb. 21, 1934), only
                                53,800,000 pesos is represented by deposits in banks, and that from
                                this amount there must be deducted at least 31,000,000 pesos of
                                which 18,000,000 has already been liquidated this year at the export
                                draft rate and 13,000,000 represents the Telephone Company’s deposit
                                at that time. These deductions would leave about 22,000,000 pesos,
                                or less than a million dollars at the current export draft rate (or
                                $1,333,000 at the rate of 16.55 to 1).</p>
                            <p rend="center">IV.</p>
                            <p>Throughout a long interview the Finance Minister discussed freely his
                                present policy, but consistently refused to consider any better rate
                                for frozen credits except in connection with a compensation treaty.
                                I am satisfied that except in response to pressure in the form of
                                some genuine threat to Chile’s markets in the United States he
                                cannot be induced to alter this position.</p>
                            <p>His present policy with respect to exchange is to maintain the export
                                draft rate at 25 to 1, equally for all countries, as to current
                                trade, and to liquidate frozen credits at this rate, except as to
                                the compensation countries. He has induced the British to furnish
                                him a complete list of their frozen credits and has liquidated all
                                but £40,000 of the British credits willing to accept this rate. He
                                realizes fully, and pointed out in some detail, that some of the
                                American frozen credits do not properly belong in that category. He
                                has made two general offers to liquidate our frozen credits at the
                                export draft rate, and is convinced that he will in time succeed in
                                clearing up the problem by this method. He asked us if the Embassy
                                is able and willing to furnish a true list of frozen credits. He
                                dislikes compensation treaties and is convinced that they have
                                worked to the injury of the foreign countries which insisted on
                                them, and have resulted in a scarcity of exchange to finance their
                                exports. He points out that Germany has not renewed the treaty which
                                expired on June 30, 1934. He insists that the compensation countries
                                themselves provide the differential in favor of their frozen credits
                                in the high price for nitrate which prevails in these countries as
                                compared with the price in England and the United States.</p>
                            <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0115"/>
                            <p rend="center">V.</p>
                            <p>My conclusion is that preferential treatment for frozen credits,
                                whether we mean by that treatment equal to that accorded to France
                                and other compensation countries or merely a preferential rate as
                                compared with current trade, cannot be secured except by a
                                compensation treaty or by some other form of definite commercial
                                pressure; and that in view of the relatively small size of the
                                genuine frozen credits now remaining and the complicated status and
                                character of these credits, making difficult the calculation of an
                                equitable preferential rate, it would be unwise and impolitic to
                                pursue such a course, since by it we would jeopardize the genuine
                                good will which now exists, and might impair a trade position which
                                appears to be distinctly favorable. If the Department should take
                                this view, there would remain the question whether it wished,
                                possibly after discussion with the American interests at home and in
                                Chile, to acquiesce in the Minister’s request for a list of American
                                frozen credits, to be provided through the Embassy, as the British
                                have done, or would consider that such a list should be provided by
                                the private interests concerned.</p>
                            <p>If this policy were pursued with respect to frozen credits, the
                                broader question would be whether it is still advantageous to
                                negotiate a general agreement respecting current trade. My present
                                view, which as yet is merely tentative, is that in view of the fact
                                that we are now receiving without agreement as good treatment on
                                current trade as could be had by means of an agreement, there is
                                little to be gained by a procedure which would involve a formal
                                relinquishment of our contention for the principle of
                                most-favored-nation treatment with respect to frozen credits. I
                                should therefore be inclined to favor the fourth of the alternatives
                                outlined in section I of the present memorandum.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to this
                            Embassy’s despatch No. 152 of July 18, 1934, transmitting a copy of the
                            Embassy’s Note No. 118 of July 17, 1934, which requested that the action
                            taken by the Caja de Previsión de Empleados Particulares in converting
                            the retirement funds of American citizens into pesos at a rate of
                            exchange lower than the recognized commercial rate be rescinded pending
                            such time as an agreement on this subject shall have been reached
                            between the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that no action was taken by the Foreign Office
                            notwithstanding the oral inquiries which were subsequently made, it <pb
                                n="50" xml:id="pg_50" facs="0116"/>was deemed necessary to address a
                            further communication to the Chilean Government requesting that the
                            reply to the Embassy’s note be expedited. A copy of this communication
                            is enclosed.<note n="27" xml:id="d33fn1">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>On July 31st the Foreign Office replied<note n="27" xml:id="d33fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> to the Embassy’s Note No. 118 stating that the
                            matter had been referred to the appropriate Ministry. Under date of
                            August 7, 1934, a reply was received<note n="27" xml:id="d33fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> to the Embassy’s Note No. 123 of July 30th setting
                            forth that the appropriate Ministry had been asked to hasten its
                            decision in the matter and that the Embassy would be informed promptly
                            thereof.</p>
                        <p>The question has since been taken up orally with the Under Secretary.
                            While he in no way questions the position taken by the Embassy with
                            respect to this problem, he indicated that the Foreign Office was unable
                            to make a suitable reply to our representations until authorized to do
                            so by the Ministry of Hacienda under whose jurisdiction this question
                            falls. It was obvious from a telephone conversation which he had with
                            the Under Secretary for Hacienda, that the latter desires to avoid a
                            decision on the matter at this time. Needless to say, it was pointed out
                            to the Under Secretary that the merits of the case in question are so
                            clear that my Government could not consent to permitting the matter to
                            drag on without a definite decision, and that in view of the fact that
                            the problem was the subject of diplomatic negotiations, we confidently
                            expect that the Chilean Government will rescind the arbitrary action of
                            the Caja in order to permit the resumption of negotiations.</p>
                        <p>During the visit of Dr. John H. Williams, the question of the repayment
                            of these funds was brought up in a general discussion with the Minister
                            of Hacienda of the pending problems of American interests. In view of
                            many different aspects of the general problem which were discussed at
                            that time it was not possible to enter into a detailed discussion of the
                            Caja. However, it was quite clear that Mr. Ross has some very definite
                            ideas as to how far he is disposed to go in the definitive settlement of
                            this question, and that it would be necessary to devote a special
                            meeting to this question. Accordingly, it is planned to obtain figures
                            on the actual amount of dollars which would be involved in a
                            satisfactory settlement of the repayment of the funds and then to
                            approach Mr. Ross directly. While at the present time Mr. Ross is
                            opposed to a settlement which would be acceptable to this Embassy, it is
                            believed that approaching him on the grounds of the relative
                            insignificance of the deposits, it may be possible to obtain his
                            authorization for settlement in the manner desired.</p>

                            stated that it included the three classes of American depositors: (1)
                            those with deposits in American currency who have left Chile; (2) those
                            with deposits in American currency who are still residing in Chile and

                            payable. With respect to the first two classes, he stated that the

                            transfer of these funds abroad. With regard to the third group, the

                            Americans residing outside of Chile have been able to convert their
                            dollar accounts into Chilean pesos only at the rate of 9.60 pesos or
                            less to the dollar and, in order to transfer the proceeds thereof
                            abroad, to reconvert into dollars at the current market or export draft
                            rate of approximately 25 pesos or more to the dollar. This procedure
                            meant a direct loss of 62% of their deposits. The terms of settlement
                            now offered would permit Americans residing outside of Chile to receive
                            in dollars 58% of their original deposits, or a loss of 42%.</p>
                        <p>The question now arises as to the attitude which the Embassy and the
                            Department should take as regards this proposal. It is the opinion of
                            the Embassy after taking into consideration the financial condition of
                            the Caja, the intransigent attitude of the Minister of Finance <pb
                                n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0118"/>and the inability of the Foreign
                            Office to influence effectively the actions of the latter, that there is
                            little use in carrying on further conversations regarding this matter in
                            Santiago unless the American Government is willing to bring some
                            pressure to bear. Should the American Government be willing to adopt any
                            coercive measures it would of course be unwise for the American
                            depositors to avail themselves of the proposal outlined above. However,
                            should the Department be unable to see its way clear to do so two
                            courses of action remain open: First, the Department can accept the
                            proposal officially and consider the negotiations closed; second, the
                            Department can refrain from answering the proposal and thus maintain the
                            principle of insistence upon full repayment of the dollar accounts.
                            However, in this case the Embassy should be permitted to notify
                            individual depositors that they may liquidate their funds in accordance
                            with the above proposal, and to add that if they fail to avail
                            themselves of this opportunity no assurances can be given as to when any
                            better terms might be available.</p>
                        <p>Considering this whole problem from the realistic rather than the
                            legalistic point of view, it is the Embassy’s considered opinion that
                            should our Government be unwilling to bring pressure to bear in order to
                            obtain better terms, the wisest course of procedure for individual
                            depositors to pursue would be to liquidate their accounts as rapidly as
                            possible under the terms now offered.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact that the Embassy had suggested to the American
                            depositors concerned who are urgently in need of their funds to withhold
                            settlement with the Caja pending the outcome of the negotiations which
                            have culminated in the present proposal of the Government of Chile, I
                            have the honor to request that the Department communicate by telegraph
                            its instructions in the premises to the end that the Embassy may advise
                            the interested Americans as to what course they should take.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: Many months back your
                                Embassy was good enough to submit to the consideration of the
                                Department under my direction the situation in which the American
                                depositors in the Caja <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0119"/>de
                                Previsión de Empleados Particulares find themselves as a result of
                                the legal provisions relating to the conversion of their deposits in
                                American money into local currency.</p>
                            <p>I have given to the problem the importance which it deserves and I
                                have endeavored to find a just solution for both parties. The
                                position of the Caja de Empleados Particulares, unfortunately, does
                                not permit it to make an extraordinary expenditure which would
                                facilitate a satisfactory solution. The Government has had to take
                                its part, very considerable, of the losses which are presumed
                                indispensable for the settlement and it believes, in this way, it
                                has responded to the always cordial spirit of the relations between
                                Chile and the United States.</p>
                            <p>The Department does not deem it relevant to analyze again the reasons
                                which determined the enactment of Law No. 5107 authorizing the
                                conversion of the deposits. “Because the national interest requires
                                it,” reads the said law, and undoubtedly the supreme necessity of
                                living made indispensable the enactment of afflictive measures which
                                affected nationals as well as foreigners. The economic and financial
                                depression, whose effects Your Excellency is aware of, imposed
                                sacrifices and restrictions of every kind unknown until then.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, without entering into the discussion of the juridical
                                point of view and confirming what I had the honor of expressing
                                verbally, it is a pleasure for me to inform Your Excellency that the
                                Government is disposed to permit that the American depositors of the
                                Caja who have or may have in the future in their accounts converted
                                into local currency at the rate of exchange of the day on which the
                                operation may be effected the funds which they deposited therein in
                                dollars, transfer those funds abroad and, in order to make that
                                transfer purchase foreign exchange at the same rate of exchange as
                                the Central Bank of Chile acquires such in conformity with the
                                contracts concluded with the copper producing companies.</p>
                            <p>It would be very pleasing to this Government to know that in this
                                manner and by virtue of an effort which devolves in great part upon
                                the Chilean Government, a problem is solved whose effects touch many
                                American citizens.</p>
                            <p>Awaiting the reply which Your Excellency may be good enough to
                                forward me, I avail myself [etc.]</p>

                        <p>78. In view of the considerations set forth in your despatch No. 211, of
                            October 17, the Department agrees that at this time no practical <pb
                                n="54" xml:id="pg_54" facs="0120"/>purpose would be served in
                            further pursuing the negotiations with the Chilean Government in the
                            hope of obtaining better terms for American depositors in the Chilean
                            Retirement Fund.</p>
                        <p>You may inform the American depositors involved of the opportunity which
                            now offers to liquidate their dollar deposits in the Retirement Fund at
                            the rate of 16.65 pesos to the dollar.</p>
                        <p>The Department, of course, has no authority to accept, in the name of the
                            interests involved, the proposal now made by the Chilean Government. You
                            are, however, authorized, in your discretion, to apprise the Chilean
                            Government that this Government will make no further representations on
                            this subject if the proposed settlement is effected. The Department
                            hopes that you will be able to obtain the small additional concession of
                            interest payments on these deposits for the past 3 years, but leaves to
                            your judgment how far to press this point.</p>

                            Department that the parties concerned are being so advised. Moreover, it
                            has been clearly pointed out that should the Consul perform this service
                            for them, he will do so free of charge but with the definite
                            understanding that he assumes no responsibility beyond that of acting as
                            a mere transmitting agent.</p>
                        <p>In order to complete the Department’s files on this subject, I have the
                            honor to transmit herewith a copy of the Embassy’s circular letter of
                            November 23, 1934,<note n="30" xml:id="d38fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            informing the depositors of the proposed settlement. This communication
                            has been addressed to all American depositors of which this Embassy has
                            record, as well as to those persons in Chile who hold powers of attorney
                            for Americans who have left this country. A list of the individuals to
                            whom the circular has been sent is also enclosed.<note n="30"

                        <p>I have the honor to forward at this same time a copy of the Embassy’s
                            Note to the Foreign Office<note n="30" xml:id="d38fn4">Not
                                printed.</note> acknowledging receipt of its communications of
                            October 11th and November 20th in which the terms of the proposed
                            liquidation of the retirement funds were set forth. The Department will
                            observe that in this reply, I have limited myself to expressing sincere
                            appreciation of the spirit of good will and cooperation which the
                            Foreign Office at all times showed during the lengthy negotiations.
                            Since this acknowledgment met with the approval of the Foreign Office,
                            it was unnecessary to include a statement such as was authorized in the
                            third paragraph of the Department’s telegram No. 78, November 5, 6 P.M.,
                            1934.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I would state that no difficulty is anticipated in
                            effecting the prompt settlement of the funds in question. In fact, the
                            Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and for Finance, as well as the
                            Manager of the Caja, have assured me of their willingness to cooperate
                            in every possible way to facilitate and expedite the repayment of these
                            deposits.</p>

                                xml:id="d39fn33">For text, see Chile, <hi rend="italic">Diario
                                    Oficial</hi>, No. 16,548, April 10, 1933.</note> providing for a
                            general increase of existing taxes. Section 17 of Article 7 of this law
                            amends paragraph 1 of Section 33 of Article 7 of Law No. 4460 of
                            November 13, 1928, first, by establishing a sales tax of 2% in lieu of
                            the former stamp tax on invoices of ten centavos for each 100 pesos
                            which was paid by the seller; and, second, by authorizing the seller to
                            pass on the tax in question directly to the buyer. The pertinent section
                            of the law reads, in translation, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… Commercial sales, including operations in foreign exchange, 2%
                                    of the amount of the transaction.</p>
                                <p>“Persons or enterprises classified in the third category
                                    (commerce and industry) of the Income Tax Law will pay this same
                                    tax on the amount received by way of interests, premiums,
                                    commissions or other forms of remuneration for business,
                                    services or loans of any kind. The said persons or enterprises
                                    can require, in all cases, that the interests, premiums,
                                    commissions or other forms of remuneration be paid them with a
                                    surcharge equivalent to the amount of the tax. …”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Since the law authorizes the seller to require the buyer to pay the tax,
                            bills for all purchases and services, including rent, electricity, gas,
                            water, telegraph and telephone bills, etc., carry a separate charge for
                            the 2% tax in addition to the price of the article or service rendered.
                            Under these circumstances the tax might be considered as a direct charge
                            by the Chilean Government against foreign Governments and diplomats.</p>
                        <p>In answer to inquiries made at the Foreign Office the opinion was
                            expressed that while the law did not specifically exempt foreign
                            diplomatic officers from the payment of the tax, it was not believed
                            that it was the intention of the legislator to place this direct burden
                            upon foreign governments and their officers. In any case, it was added,
                            the matter could be satisfactorily arranged on the grounds of
                            reciprocity. <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0123"/>With this end in
                            view the Foreign Office suggested that the Embassy bring the question to
                            its attention in an informal memorandum. However, before submitting such
                            a memorandum I desire to know whether the Department is disposed to
                            press for exemption from this tax. Doubt as to what attitude the
                            Department might take with respect to this question has been caused by
                            the statement made in Department’s circular instruction of October 24,
                                1925,<note n="34" xml:id="d39fn34">Not printed.</note> concerning
                            exemptions from taxation enjoyed by foreign diplomatic officers within
                            the United States. It will be recalled that in that instruction the
                            question of taxes on the sales of automobiles and jewelry was discussed
                            and it was held that foreign diplomatic officers were not exempted
                            because the Government looked to the manufacturer and the vendor for the
                            payment of the tax and not to the purchaser of the article. It was added
                            that for this reason and the further reason that the price of the
                            articles sold is a matter of negotiation between the vendor and the
                            purchaser, the position was taken that no exemption from the payment of
                            these taxes could be granted to the manufacturer or vendor by reason of
                            the fact that the sale was made to a diplomatic representative of a
                            foreign government.</p>
                        <p>The sales tax of 2% established by Law No. 5154 is of course much more
                            comprehensive than the luxury tax referred to in the Department’s
                            circular instruction above mentioned since it covers every kind of a
                            commercial transaction.</p>
                        <p>I therefore have the honor to request instructions as to whether the
                            Department wishes the Embassy to protest the tax in general, or to limit
                            the protest to the payment of the tax on fixed charges, such as bills
                            for rent, telephone, electric light, telegraph and other similar
                            services, which do not admit of price negotiation. In view of the fact
                            that I am withholding the payment of bills now due and which should be
                            included in the Embassy’s June accounts, I have the honor to request
                            that the Department telegraph its instructions prior to June 30th.</p>

                            No. 1487 of June 21, 1933, concerning the 2% sales tax on services
                            rendered to and articles purchased by the United States Government in
                            Chile, and to the Department’s telegram No. 38 of July 29, 2 p.m., 1933,
                            instructing that this Mission limit its protest to the payment of the
                            tax on fixed charges, I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy of
                            the Embassy’s Memorandum on this subject left at the Foreign Office on
                            August 17, 1933,<note n="37" xml:id="d41fn37">Not printed.</note> and a
                            copy, together with English translation, of a Memorandum of the Chilean
                            Government of September 29, 1933, replying thereto.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that the Embassy’s Memorandum of August 17, 1933,
                            points out that the pertinent section of Law No. 5154 amends former Law
                            No. 4460 by establishing a sales tax of 2%, and by authorizing the
                            seller to collect the said tax directly from the buyer; that
                            consequently the corresponding invoices carry, in addition to the agreed
                            price, a separate charge of 2%, or the sales tax; and that in view
                            thereof, the charge would appear to be in the nature of a direct tax
                            against the American Government. The Memorandum then sets forth that
                            this practice, in so far as it concerns the payment of the tax on fixed
                            charges not subject to negotiation between the seller and buyer, is
                            contrary to the treatment accorded officers of the Chilean Government in
                            the United States. In consideration thereof and [of?] the view expressed
                            informally by the Foreign Office, that it was not believed to be the
                            intention of the Congress to place a direct burden upon foreign
                            governments, the Memorandum presumes that the Chilean Government does
                            not wish to apply this direct tax.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office, in reply to this memorandum seeks to evade the issue
                            by the specious argument that the tax is not a sales tax, nor even a tax
                            of any kind, but is a surcharge due to the increased cost of living
                            which the Government of Chile itself is obliged to pay. <pb n="59"
                                xml:id="pg_59" facs="0125"/>Such reasoning carries no conviction.
                            Unquestionably, the 2% charge is a direct tax for the benefit of the
                            Government and not simply a legalized surcharge on industrial and
                            commercial operations.</p>
                        <p>Awaiting further instructions from the Department, the Embassy is
                            declining to pay this tax.</p>

                            <p>In the Memorandum of August 17, 1933, the Embassy of the United
                                States of America referred to the application of the tax of 2%
                                established by Law No. 5154 on invoices for services rendered or
                                articles sold to the offices of the Government of the United States
                                of America or to the diplomatic or consular officers of that
                                country, and pointed out that it involved a direct tax against the
                                said American Government and its officers.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs points out that
                                Law No. 5154 established the so-called tax “on the total amount of
                                business,” which imposes a tax of 2% on the amount received by way
                                of interests, premiums, commissions or other form[s] of
                                remuneration, authorizing the persons or enterprises subject to the
                                said tax to increase their interests, premiums, etc., in a sum
                                equivalent to the amount of the tax. The same law raised the former
                                tax on services and sales which was ½% on the value thereof, to 2%
                                and also authorized the persons or enterprises subject thereto to
                                increase their prices in an amount equivalent to the tax.</p>
                            <p>It does not therefore appear possible to say that the persons who
                                contract with those enterprises which are subject to the tax on the
                                amount involved, pay a fiscal tax. These persons experience only the
                                increased cost of living which all taxes normally cause. It is
                                indispensable to distinguish between the tax provided for commercial
                                or industrial enterprises and the higher price which the enterprises
                                charge or may charge their clients.</p>
                            <p>In the case to which the Embassy of the United States of America
                                refers, it is necessary to observe finally that it does not involve
                                a tax of 2% but a surcharge authorized by Law 5154. Thus, the
                                Chilean Government itself is obliged to pay its accounts with the
                                said surcharge which would not be the case if the payment of such a
                                surcharge could be construed as the payment of a tax.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to the Embassy’s
                            despatch No. 1551, of October 3, 1933, and preceding correspondence
                            concerning the application of the Chilean sales tax to services rendered
                            to and articles purchased by the diplomatic and consular representatives
                            of the United States Government in Chile.</p>
                        <p>The action of the Chargé d’Affaires in this matter is approved, except as
                            to certain limitations hereinafter discussed. Reference is made to the
                            Department’s telegraphic instruction of July 29, 1933, in which
                            attention was called to the fifth paragraph of the General Instruction
                            of October 24, 1925. It should be noted that while the sales tax
                            referred to in this paragraph was similar to the Chilean sales tax under
                            reference, there are certain differences between the two. The Chilean
                            law authorizes the person or business from whom the tax is collected to
                            pass it on to the consumers. Moreover, there is a difference between a
                            luxury tax on articles like automobiles or jewelry, and a tax on items
                            such as rates for gas, electricity, water, etc., the latter being
                            practically necessities, and the power of the purchaser to negotiate for
                            the price being negligible. There is a further important difference <pb
                                n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0127"/>between fixed charges such as the
                            Department is concerned with herein, and bargaining sales.</p>
                        <p>For your information a copy is enclosed of a circular note mailed to
                            foreign diplomatic missions in the United States on October 12, 1932,
                            and to the Chilean Mission in the United States on October 24, 1932. It
                            is suggested that you should call the attention of the Chilean Foreign
                            Office to this circular instruction [<hi rend="italic">note?</hi>], and
                            point out that in view of the liberal attitude of this Government in
                            regard to taxation as it is set forth in this instruction [<hi
                                rend="italic">note?</hi>], it would seem that American diplomatic
                            representatives in Chile should be exempted from the application of the
                            Chilean sales tax in so far as it refers to fixed charges.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the Chargé’s protest against the application of the
                            Chilean sales tax to American consular officers, it would appear that
                            under international law consuls do not necessarily enjoy the same
                            exemptions from taxation as diplomatic representatives. There is no
                            consular convention or treaty dealing with this subject between the
                            United States and Chile. In view of these circumstances and considering
                            that the United States did not apply the exemption from the Federal
                            excise taxes in 1932 to consular officers, as set forth in the
                            above-mentioned circular instruction [<hi rend="italic">note?</hi>] to
                            foreign missions, you are requested to limit your protest against
                            payment of the Chilean sales tax to American diplomatic representatives
                            in Chile.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 8 of January 10, 1934, and preceding
                            correspondence concerning the application of the Chilean sales tax to
                            services rendered to and articles purchased by the diplomatic
                            representatives of the United States Government in Chile.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon receipt of this instruction a Memorandum, as per copy
                                enclosed,<note n="39" xml:id="d44fn39">Not printed.</note> was left
                            with the Foreign Office. On numerous occasions since that time the
                            matter has been discussed informally with the appropriate authorities.
                            Particular stress has been placed on the fact that the United States
                            Government in according exemption from Federal excise taxes to foreign
                            diplomatic officers has done so under the application of the principles
                            of international law exempting from taxation ambassadors, ministers and
                            other duly accredited diplomatic representatives of foreign
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>At first the Foreign Office endeavored to sustain the position taken in
                            its Memorandum of September 29, 1933, (Enclosure No. 2, despatch No.
                            1551, October 3, 1933), that the 2% charge is not a government tax but a
                            surcharge authorized by Law No. 5154. Later it advanced the theory that
                            the tax was not imposed upon diplomatic representatives since the
                            Government of Chile looks to the vendor and not to the purchaser for the
                            payment of the charge. In both cases the Embassy was able to point out
                            that the 2% charge is effectively a government tax, which, in view of
                            the manner in which it is itemized in invoices and particularly those
                            for fixed charges, is paid directly by the diplomatic representatives of
                            foreign governments.</p>
                        <p>During the course of the conversations with the Foreign Office the Under
                            Secretary repeatedly expressed the desire of the Government of Chile to
                            exempt foreign diplomatic representatives from the payment of the 2%
                            sales tax. He explained, however, that since the pertinent law makes no
                            provision for the exemption of such officers, the <pb n="63"
                                xml:id="pg_63" facs="0129"/>Executive is not authorized, even on the
                            grounds of reciprocity, to waive the imposition. In this connection he
                            stated that under Chilean jurisprudence the municipal law obtains and as
                            provision is not made for general exemption from taxation of foreign
                            diplomatic representatives, Congress must enact special legislation
                            granting the exemption. The Under Secretary added that at the
                            appropriate time the Executive desired to submit to Congress a bill
                            which would exempt foreign diplomats from the payment of the tax in
                            question. However, the Government is confronted with the fact that it
                            considers it politically impossible at this moment to raise with
                            Congress the question of any exemption from this tax. The sales tax has
                            been unpopular from its inception notwithstanding its continuance is
                            considered essential in order to maintain a balanced budget.
                            Furthermore, there is a large group in Congress against it and the
                            Executive hesitates to submit any legislation which will raise the
                            question in any form.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>It is apparent that nothing further can be done by the Embassy to obtain
                            a modification of the existing practice in Chile with respect to this
                            tax, especially since the Government attributes to political reasons its
                            inability to correct the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> situation. I
                            would add in this connection that it was explained to the Foreign Office
                            that while the American Government accords its present liberal treatment
                            to foreign diplomatic representatives under the application of the
                            principle of international law, its action is predicated on reciprocal
                            treatment to American diplomatic officers by the accrediting foreign
                            governments. The Under Secretary replied that while he regretted
                            extremely the inability of his Government to accord similar privileges
                            to American diplomatic officers and he realized that the United States
                            might wish to withdraw these privileges now extended to Chilean
                            diplomatic officers in the United States, his Government was not in a
                            position to give any satisfaction at this time.</p>
                        <p>While it seemed that little could be gained by pursuing the question
                            further, it was pointed out that the principle whereunder foreign
                            governments exempted each other from taxation appears so well
                            established that the decision of the Foreign Office could not be
                            accepted pending instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing I have the honor to request that the Department
                            instruct me as to what action should be taken by me with respect to
                            those taxes assessed against the Embassy which I have declined to pay on
                            the grounds of the general exemption from taxation accorded by
                            governments to each other.</p>

                            recognizing that the Chilean Government is being granted <pb n="65"
                                xml:id="pg_65" facs="0131"/>this courtesy in the United States, has
                            definitely refused to take any affirmative action in the matter. In view
                            of this situation the Embassy feels that no useful purpose can be served
                            by pressing further at this time. The Department of course may wish to
                            consider whether it shall recommend the annulment on the part of the
                            Treasury Department of the tax exemption privileges now being granted
                            the Chilean Government and its representatives in the United States.</p>

                        <p>55. Consideration is being given to the means of bringing into force the
                            provisions of the trade agreement signed December 15, 1933.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d48fn2"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_249"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Ibid.</hi>, p. 249</ref>. For an analysis of the provisions
                                of the agreement, see instruction No. 55, April 5, 1934, to the
                                Minister in Nicaragua, <hi rend="italic">post</hi>, <ref
                                    target="#pg_499">p. 499</ref>.</note> It was contemplated when
                            the agreement was signed that it would be made effective on the part of
                            this Government by special act of Congress. It is now desired to bring
                            the provisions of the agreement into force under the Trade Agreements
                            Act of June 12, 1934,<note n="3" xml:id="d48fn3">48 Stat. 943.</note>
                            which does not apply to agreements concluded prior thereto. Moreover,
                            Section 4 of the Act requires reasonable public notice of the intention
                            to conclude such agreements, such notice being defined by Executive
                            Order as notice of not less than 30 days.</p>
                        <p>Please take up the matter with the Colombian Government and ascertain its
                            attitude regarding the signing of a new agreement. It is not anticipated
                            that any important changes of substance in the provisions of the
                            agreement signed December 15, 1933 would be proposed by this Government
                            since the views of domestic interests were received and considered under
                            the informal procedure prevailing when that agreement was negotiated.
                            However, it would not be consistent with the purpose of Section 4 of the
                            Act to give any definite assurance to this effect. In any case some
                            changes of a formal character would probably be appropriate,
                            particularly in Article XI which relates to the method of making the
                            agreement effective.</p>
                        <p>Consideration must be given at this time to the probable plans of the
                            Colombian Government with respect to obtaining legislative approval of
                            the new agreement as these plans have a bearing on the length of notice
                            to be given by this Government under Section 4 of the Act. If the
                            Colombian Government should desire to obtain <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67"
                                facs="0133"/>approval of the new agreement at the present regular
                            session of the Colombian Congress the minimum public notice of 30 days
                            would be given. Assuming that this notice were given about September
                            first this Government would be in a position to sign the new agreement
                            about October first, which would leave about 20 days of the regular
                            session in which to obtain approval by the Colombian Congress. On the
                            other hand, if legislative approval in Colombia is to be sought at a
                            later time, 6 weeks’ notice would be given here, which would permit
                            signature about the middle of October. Please ascertain and report the
                            probable plans of the Colombian Government in this matter.</p>
                        <p>For your confidential information this Government desires to bring the
                            new agreement into force simultaneously with a similar agreement with
                            Brazil, negotiations for which are expected to begin shortly.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d48fn4">See <ref target="frus1934v04#pg_542">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>, pp. 542</ref> ff.</note> Tentative
                            plans are to complete these negotiations and sign the agreement with
                            Brazil by December first. Present indications are that the Brazilian
                            legislature probably will not adjourn before December 31 and that it
                            could take action on the agreement before that date. It is therefore
                            important that legislative action be taken on the new agreement with
                            Colombia before the end of this year. Please report such information as
                            you may be able to obtain regarding the prospects of such action.</p>

                        <p>69. Department’s 55, August 28, 6 p.m. Colombian Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs has informed me that his Government agrees to signing a new
                            trade agreement and is cabling its Legation in Washington to that
                            effect. The Colombian Government desires to obtain approval of the new
                            agreement at the present regular session of Congress or during the
                            extraordinary session which will probably follow regular session. (It is
                            customary for the Colombian Congress to extend itself in extraordinary
                            session until November 15th.) The Colombian Government will leave to the
                            United States to decide whether the new agreement be signed the first
                            week in October or later.</p>
                        <p>I am informed verbally by the Minister that the Foreign Affairs
                            committees of the House and Senate have almost completed their study of
                            the agreement. They have however agreed to the signing of a new one.</p>

                            extraordinary power to the President specifically to conclude a trade
                            agreement with the United States within his discretion, or (2) that the

                            Congress openly to discuss the terms of the pending agreement during the
                            debates on such bill.</p>

                                commercial treaty with the United States would be permitted before

                                thinks that Congress will adjourn before the early part of 1935.
                                Commercial Attaché and I do not believe that the budget for 1935 can
                                be presented to Congress before the middle of November. It is
                                believed discussions regarding other internal affairs and the Rio de
                                Janeiro Pact will be prolonged so as to force the President to call
                                a special session. It is even believed in some informed circles that
                                the President wishes to keep Congress in session until June in order
                                to place upon it the responsibility for governing. Consequently it
                                is felt that the Department can readily ask the Colombian Government
                                to postpone consideration of the trade agreement by its Congress at
                                least until December, if not later.</item>

                        <p>92. All interested Colombian officials whom I have met since my return to
                            Bogotá have inquired about the status of the commercial agreement. They
                            appear to be anxious as the result of reports that the United States
                            will propose important changes in the agreement signed last December.
                            Furthermore, President Lopez apparently intends within a few days to
                            summon Congress to convene in extraordinary session in the month of
                            December for the purpose of considering only the subjects enumerated in
                            the Legation’s telegram No. 89, November 17, 10 a.m.,<note n="9"
                                xml:id="d53fn9">Not printed.</note> among which is not included the
                            commercial agreement. In view of the above I believe it highly important
                            that the Department immediately give the Colombian Government some
                            indication as to what it will propose regarding the contents of the new
                            agreement and when it may be published and freely discussed.</p>

                            indicating the changes which this Government desires to make in the
                            trade agreement signed December 15, 1933. Mr. Sayre indicated his
                            understanding that discussions of the proposed agreement would take
                            place in Washington. He expressed the hope that the conclusion of the
                            agreement would be expedited as much as possible so that it could be
                            submitted to the Colombian Congress at its extraordinary session.</p>
                        <p>Mr. González stated that if the agreement could be concluded in time, the
                            Colombian Government would submit it to Congress at its extraordinary
                            session, which, he said, probably would not adjourn until the middle of
                            February.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre then called attention to the fact that this Government is not
                            proposing any very radical changes in the agreement signed December 15,
                            1933. The principal changes are those relating to the non-application of
                            the anti-dumping act to coffee, and the provisions regarding internal
                            taxes. Mr. Sayre explained that when the agreement of December 15, 1933,
                            was signed, it was the intention of this Government to request Congress
                            to make it effective by special act which would supersede any
                            conflicting provisions in existing law. Since it is now intended to
                            bring the agreement into force under the authority of the Trade
                            Agreements Act, it is necessary that its provisions come clearly within
                            the authority of that Act. The provision regarding the non-application
                            of the anti-dumping act to coffee and regarding the limitation of the
                            amount of state and municipal taxes, not being authorized by the Trade
                            Agreements Act, it becomes necessary to change them. Mr. González seemed
                            to feel that these changes would not create any serious difficulty.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Sayre then called attention to the fact that this Government is
                            offering additional concessions on three products of Colombia involving
                            a 50% reduction in existing duties, these additional concessions being
                            made possible by the fact that the Trade Agreements Act has provided the
                            authorization necessary therefor. He stated that we would appreciate
                            such consideration as Colombia on its part might give to the granting of
                            additional concessions on American products. Mr. González expressed his
                            gratification regarding the proposed additional concessions by the
                            United States. He seemed to feel that there is a possibility of
                            reciprocal action by Colombia, especially since duty reductions are
                            already under consideration in Colombia. He pointed out, however, that
                            the executive branch of the Colombian Government, unlike that of the
                            United States, must submit the agreement to the legislature and this
                            tends to make additional concessions by Colombia more difficult.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Sayre then called attention to the proposal of this Government, that
                            an exchange of notes be entered into concurrently with the proposed
                            trade agreement, in regard to foreign exchange control. Mr. González
                            stated that the foreign exchange control problem is being cleared up. He
                            said that as regards current business, American interests have no
                            difficulty in getting exchange. With reference to blocked commercial
                            credits, he stated that 40% of the credits blocked as of September,
                            1931, have been liquidated and referred to the announcement of the
                            Colombian Government, following the inquiry by our Legation at Bogotá,
                            to the effect that the remaining 60% of the blocked credits will be
                            cleared up in three monthly installments, ending February 15, 1935.
                            While he could not speak officially, Mr. González stated that there is a
                            definite trend toward the complete removal of foreign exchange
                            control.</p>

                            desired to conclude a new trade agreement with the Republic of Colombia,
                            under the authority of the Trade Agreements Act approved by the
                            President on June 12, 1934, to replace the Agreement signed December 15,
                            1933. It was explained in the memorandum under reference that the <pb
                                n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0139"/>Act of June 12, 1934, authorizes
                            the President to enter into trade agreements with foreign countries and
                            to make them effective by proclamation without the necessity of
                            obtaining a special act of Congress in each case, and requires, among
                            other things, that the intention to negotiate any such agreement must be
                            publicly announced in order that interested persons may have an
                            opportunity to present their views.</p>
                        <p>These requirements having been complied with, in connection with the
                            proposed new trade agreement with the Republic of Colombia, the
                            Government of the United States is now in a position to proceed with the
                            negotiation of an agreement based upon the provisions of the Agreement
                            signed December 15, 1933, and to indicate the changes in the latter
                            instrument which it suggests be incorporated in the proposed new
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the text of the Agreement signed December 15, 1933, it
                            is necessary to propose a number of changes. There is attached the text
                            of the proposed new agreement as it would appear if the suggested
                            changes were made. For convenience, there is also attached a comparative
                            text of the Agreement signed December 15, 1933, showing proposed
                            omissions and additions.<note n="13" xml:id="d56fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> The changes indicated are in large part only formal
                            and will doubtless in most cases be found to be self-explanatory.
                            However, certain of them seem to require some explanation and
                            comment.</p>
                        <p>Article III of the Agreement signed December 15, 1933, provided in effect
                            that the provisions regarding the customs treatment to be accorded by
                            each country to the products of the other should not apply to such
                            special duties as are, or may be required to be, imposed by the laws of
                            either country on importations which are not properly marked to indicate
                            their origin, or to anti-dumping duties. With respect to the latter
                            stipulation, however, the article contained an exception to the effect
                            that anti-dumping duties would not be applied to unroasted coffee
                            imported into the United States from Colombia.</p>
                        <p>When the Agreement of December 15, 1933, was signed, it was the intention
                            to submit it to the Congress of the United States to be enacted into
                            law. Under this procedure the effect of Article III, if approval of the
                            Agreement by the Congress had been obtained, would have been to modify
                            the Anti-dumping Act by statutory enactment. The situation, however, has
                            been altered by the fact that the proposed new agreement will be brought
                            into force on the part of the United States by Executive action, under
                            the authority of the Trade Agreements Act of June 12, 1934. It becomes
                            necessary, therefore, to make certain that the provisions of the
                            proposed agreement come clearly within the authority of that Act. The
                            exception above referred to regarding the non-application of the
                            Anti-dumping Act to coffee imported from <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74"
                                facs="0140"/>Colombia has been carefully considered by the competent
                            legal officers of this Government, and they have expressed grave doubt
                            whether the Trade Agreements Act authorizes the inclusion of this
                            provision in the proposed agreement. For this reason it is considered
                            necessary to propose that it be omitted. It may be pointed out, however,
                            that in the thirteen years during which the Anti-dumping Act has been in
                            effect there has been no occasion for the application of that Act to
                            green coffee imported from Colombia.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States also desires further that the whole
                            of Article III of the Agreement signed December 15, 1933, be omitted
                            from the new agreement and that the other matters dealt with in that
                            article be provided for in general terms in Articles I and II, as
                            indicated in the attached draft of the new agreement. It is believed
                            that the provisions in Article III of the Agreement signed December 15,
                            1933, regarding additional duties on articles not marked to indicate the
                            country of origin and regarding anti-dumping duties are adequately dealt
                            with in the general clause proposed for inclusion in Articles I and II,
                            whereby the duty reductions on products specified in the Schedules are
                            confined to ordinary customs duties, and whereby such products are
                            exempted from any other duties, taxes, fees or charges other or higher
                            “than those imposed or required to be imposed by laws … in effect on the
                            date of the signature” of the Agreement.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Article IV of the Agreement of December 15, 1933,
                            relating to internal taxes, the changes suggested are based on
                            considerations similar to those with respect to the non-application of
                            anti-dumping duties to green coffee imported from Colombia. As in the
                            latter case, there is grave doubt whether the Trade Agreements Act of
                            June 12, 1934, authorizes the inclusion of any provision with regard to
                            the limitation of the amount of state or municipal taxes. For this
                            reason it is necessary to propose that the provisions of the third
                            paragraph of Article IV, whereby such a limitation is imposed, be
                            omitted from the new agreement. It will be observed that in the proposed
                            revision of the text the corresponding obligation on the part of the
                            Republic of Colombia with respect to departmental and municipal taxes
                            has been omitted.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, a further study of the legal considerations involved
                            has led to the conclusion that it would be possible, in conformity with
                            constitutional provisions, to include in the proposed new agreement a
                            provision for national and most-favored-nation treatment with respect to
                            state and municipal taxes. The provisions of the second paragraph of the
                            proposed revised text of Article IV have been modified in accordance
                            with the above considerations. The Government of the United States
                            requests that, reciprocally, the provision for national and
                            most-favored-nation treatment in Colombia regarding departmental and
                            municipal taxes likewise be revised so as to be <pb n="75"
                                xml:id="pg_75" facs="0141"/>made applicable to all articles
                            enumerated and described in Schedule I. This would, of course, involve
                            the omission of Schedule III of the Agreement signed December 15,
                            1933.</p>
                        <p>Article IV as thus revised would provide (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) for
                            national and most-favored-nation treatment with respect to national or
                            federal internal taxes on all articles, whether or not included in the
                            appended Schedules; (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a limitation on the
                            absolute amount of national or federal internal taxes on articles
                            enumerated and described in the Schedules; and (<hi rend="italic"
                            >c</hi>) reciprocal national and most-favored-nation treatment with
                            respect to state or departmental, and municipal taxes on all articles
                            enumerated and described in the Schedules.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the tariff concessions set forth in Schedule II of the
                            Agreement signed December 15, 1933, the Government of the United States
                            is prepared to add the following articles to the list of products on

                            of the United States included in Schedule I of the Agreement signed
                            December 15, 1933, the Government of the United States invites attention
                            to the fact that certain of the rates of duty in the Colombian tariff,
                            particularly those on agricultural products, are extremely high and
                            would remain so even if they were reduced as provided for in Schedule I
                            of the Agreement signed December 15, 1933. Therefore, the Government of
                            the United States would appreciate such consideration as the Government
                            of the Republic of Colombia may be disposed to give to the possibility
                            of granting some further reductions in such duties.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the matter of foreign exchange control, the Government
                            of the United States proposes that there be included in a separate
                            exchange of notes, to be entered into concurrently with the proposed
                            trade agreement, provisions on this subject designed reciprocally to
                            protect the interests of the two countries.</p>

                        <p>112. Department’s 72, December 26, 4 p.m. Holidays and the preoccupation
                            of the remaining official with the Rio de Janeiro Pact have apparently
                            caused postponement of serious study of the proposals. The Secretary of
                            the Foreign Office tells me that he is concerned over the changes
                            regarding municipal and state taxes and over article X of the revised
                            proposals. Regarding the latter he asks whether the United States might
                            not apply control measures to the export of implements of war to
                            Colombia which would not be applied to exports destined to an enemy of
                            Colombia.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also informs me that President Lopez had stated that he
                            foresaw no difficulty in presenting the commercial treaty to Congress in
                            the near future thereby indicating that he contemplated calling another
                            extra session in the new year.</p>

                        <p>74. Your 112, December 26, 1934. For your confidential information trade
                            agreement negotiations with Brazil are nearing completion and it is
                            desired to conclude the Colombian negotiations without delay in order
                            that the two agreements may be brought into force simultaneously.
                            Accordingly, you are requested to urge discreetly that the proposals be
                            acted upon promptly.</p>
                        <p>It is especially desired that Colombia agree to the proposed changes
                            relating to state and municipal taxes. Since the Secretary of the
                            Foreign Office has expressed an interest therein it is suggested that
                                <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0150"/>you discuss the matter orally
                            and informally with him pointing out that inasmuch as this Government
                            now is offering to accord to the products of Colombia enumerated in
                            Schedule Two unqualified and unrestricted national and most favored
                            nation treatment with respect to such taxes, the request that the same
                            treatment be accorded to all of the products of the United States
                            enumerated in Schedule I is fair and reciprocal. In this connection it
                            will be recalled that in the agreement of December 15, 1933, the pledge
                            on the part of this Government insofar as national treatment relating to
                            state and municipal taxes is concerned is restricted to such taxes
                            “affecting interstate or foreign commerce.” Further, the new proposal
                            would place no limitation on the amount of such taxes, whereas the
                            agreement of December 15, 1933, does limit the amount thereof.</p>
                        <p>Also, it may be said that in the view of this Government the new proposal
                            relating to state and municipal taxes is the only change of importance
                            in the agreement of December 15, 1933, which has been definitely
                            proposed (for this Government does not consider elimination of the
                            provision suspending application of the anti-dumping act to green coffee
                            to be of any practical importance to Colombia).</p>
                        <p>This Government might have definitely proposed deeper tariff reductions
                            and reductions on additional important American exports to Colombia in
                            view of the fact that many of the rates of duty in the Colombian tariff,
                            particularly those on agricultural products, are extremely high and a
                            number of the tariff concessions accorded by Colombia are little more
                            than nominal. Instead, as regards the tariff concessions accorded by
                            Colombia, this Government has confined itself merely to a statement that
                            it would appreciate such consideration as the Colombian Government may
                            be disposed to give in respect of further tariff reductions.</p>
                        <p>Concerning Article X, you may inform the Secretary of the Foreign Office
                            that this is a typical article which we plan to include in all our trade
                            agreements. Its purpose is to reserve to each government the unqualified
                            right to apply control measures to the export or sale for export of
                            arms, munitions, or implements of war to any country whether or not such
                            export control measures are applied to any other country. However, you
                            may point out informally that it has not been the policy of this
                            Government, when Latin American countries are at war, to apply control
                            measures to such exports to one belligerent and not to the other.</p>
                        <p>Please report promptly by cable.</p>

                            taxes on coffee under the terms of the agreement of December 15th,

                        <p>2. Your 115, December 31, 11:00 a.m. There is no provision in the
                            agreement of December 15, 1933, which would prevent, without
                            qualification, the collection of municipal sales taxes in the United
                            States on coffee or any other product imported from Colombia and no
                            assurances have been given to the Colombian Government at any time that
                            the, Federal Government of the United States could or would prevent in
                            general the imposition of such taxes under the terms of the agreement or
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the negotiations leading to the agreement mentioned, it
                            was fully explained to the Colombian technical experts that the weight
                            of legal authority strongly inclines to the view that, under the
                            constitutional regime in the United States, the Federal Government is
                            without power, whether by treaty or statutory enactment, to prohibit
                            states or municipalities from imposing excise or consumption taxes,
                            including, of course, sales taxes, except with respect to taxes directly
                            affecting interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, it will be noted that the provisions of Article IV of the
                            agreement in question, relating to national treatment and limitations
                            upon the amount of state and municipal taxes in the United States, are
                            limited to excise or consumption taxes which affect interstate or
                            foreign commerce and are or may be subject to statutory control by the
                            Federal Government in the exercise of its constitutional powers.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your telegram No. 36,
                            December 18, 3:00 p.m., regarding the desire of the Costa Rican
                            Government to negotiate a new commercial treaty with the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>Before negotiations are undertaken the basis of the proposed trade
                            agreement should be further explored. You should therefore take up the
                            matter informally with the Foreign Minister and ascertain more
                            specifically the character of the agreement which he has in mind. Over
                            eighty percent of Costa Rica’s exports to the United States consist of
                            coffee and bananas. In the proposed agreement, therefore, the United
                            States might undertake that these products should continue to be
                            admitted free of duty in return for reductions in duties by Costa Rica
                            on important products of the United States. It is possible that in the
                            course of the exploratory conversations Costa Rica may wish to bring to
                            the attention of the United States other products in addition to
                            bananas, and coffee, on which concessions would be desired. While
                            sympathetic consideration would be given to any such proposals, it is
                            believed that in view of the importance of coffee and bananas in Costa
                            Rica’s trade with the United States a guaranty of continued free entry
                            of these products would be equivalent in value to concessions by Costa
                            Rica on the principal products imported from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The trade agreement might also contain a provision for unconditional and
                            unrestricted most favored nation treatment, subject to the usual
                            exception regarding Cuba, and other generally recognized exceptions;
                            provision against quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports of
                            products respecting which tariff concessions are granted by each party
                            under the agreement; provision against increased internal taxes on such
                            products; and national treatment with respect to internal taxes on all
                            products.</p>
                        <p>If the Foreign Minister is prepared to begin exploratory conversations
                            along the lines above indicated, the Department will send you as soon as
                            possible a statement regarding the concessions which would probably be
                            requested by the United States.</p>
                        <p>You should make it clear that the intention of this Government is solely
                            to explore the situation with a view to determining whether negotiations
                            if undertaken would be likely to meet with success.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to Instruction No. 10 of
                            January 4, 1934, in reply to my telegram No. 36 of December 18, 3 p.m.
                            (1933), concerning the desire of the Costa Rican Government to negotiate
                            a new commercial treaty with the United States, I have the honor to
                            report:—</p>
                        <p>On yesterday I discussed this matter further at a conference jointly with
                            President Ricardo Jimenez and Foreign Minister Leonidas Pacheco in the
                            office of the President. I explained to both officials that while the
                            United States was willing to give sympathetic consideration to their
                            suggestion for a new treaty, that in view of the fact that the
                            exportation of Costa Rican coffee and bananas to the United States
                            furnishes such a tremendous factor in the total of Costa Rican foreign
                            trade, that the United States sought concessions with reference to
                            American products imported by this country.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out also that the United States would desire that the proposed
                            treaty contain a provision for unconditional and unrestricted most
                            favored nation treatment; likewise provision against quantitative
                            restriction on imports of products respecting which tariff concessions
                            are granted by each party under the agreement; provision against
                            increased internal taxes on such products, and national treatment in
                            respect to internal taxes on all products.</p>
                        <p>In the absence of specific instructions from the State Department, I was
                            unable, at their request, to say definitely upon what American products
                            my Government would desire concessions, but I called their attention to
                            the situation now prevailing with reference to the importation of
                            American food products, particularly flour, fats and canned groceries.
                            These are not luxury articles and neither are they competitive with
                            Costa Rican products.</p>
                        <p>The majority of such foodstuffs imported by Costa Rica come from the
                            United States, but the duties are so high that the prices are almost
                            prohibitive, particularly with reference to vegetable and meat fats and
                            canned foodstuffs.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the duty on canned foodstuffs, I called the
                            President’s attention to a personal observation I made during the
                            present week. On the 9th of January, I received from the United States
                            Navy Commissary Store at the Canal Zone, three small cases of canned
                            foodstuffs which cost $12.50. As the Department is aware, diplomatic
                            officers in Costa Rica are permitted to receive their personal shipments
                            without payment of duty. It is a custom, however, to return with the
                            bill of lading a cancelled customs receipt. Attached to the bill of <pb
                                n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0155"/>lading for these $12.50 of
                            groceries was a customs receipt for ¢159.80. At the current rate of
                            exchange of 04.50 to $1, this is a duty of $35.50 on the $12.50
                            shipment.</p>
                        <p>The President and Foreign Minister Pacheco agreed with me that this duty
                            is so high that the purchase of American canned goods imported into
                            Costa Rica is beyond the means of the ordinary consumer. They also
                            agreed that such an excessive tariff on non-competitive articles
                            defeated the fundamental purpose of the tax because it restricted
                            consumption.</p>
                        <p>In my conversations I also suggested that perhaps the United States
                            Government might desire certain concessions on textiles which are
                            imported in large quantities from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The President and the Foreign Minister both expressed a willingness to
                            grant the United States reciprocal advantages in return for the
                            continued assurance of a free of duty market for Costa Rican coffee and
                            bananas. The Costa Rican Government, I should add, is extremely desirous
                            of a perpetuation of this satisfactory arrangement from their
                            standpoint, not only because of the immediate market possibilities but
                            also because there prevails in this country a general desire to greatly
                            increase markets in the United States for Costa Rican coffee, and it is
                            the belief of Government officials that if and when the proposed
                            Inter-American Highway is completed, large undeveloped areas will be
                            made available for coffee which, it is hoped, can be sold in the markets
                            of the United States.</p>
                        <p>At the moment, neither official was in a position to suggest whether they
                            desired additional tariff favors from the United States, but I was told
                            that the matter would be discussed with Finance Minister Brenes and if
                            there was anything else that he was interested in aside from equal
                            courtesies with other nations on the importation of Costa Rican
                            manufactured liquors, I would be so notified.</p>
                        <p>For the information of the Department, I am attaching herewith memoranda
                            prepared for me, at my request, by Vice Consul Livingston
                                Satterthwaite,<note n="8" xml:id="d66fn8">Not printed.</note> in
                            charge of the American Consulate in San José, with reference to duties
                            on principal American imports. There are on file in the Department at
                            present, detailed reports from the Consulate showing dollar values of
                            American imports by Costa Rica which will be helpful to the Department
                            in preparing, for my guidance, a statement “regarding the concessions
                            which would probably be requested by the United States”.</p>
                        <p>If the State Department desires that I carry on with these conversations

                        <p>28. Department’s instruction No. 10, January 4, 1934. The Department
                            wishes to commence exploratory conversations as soon as possible. It is
                            therefore preparing a study of the trade between the two countries and a
                            list of the concessions which would probably be asked of Costa Rica.
                            This list will be forwarded to you shortly. It is hoped that Costa Rica
                            in turn will be in a position to expedite its own study in order that
                            actual conversations can be initiated in San José not later than
                            September 1. Please ascertain and report whether this is agreeable to
                            the Government of Costa Rica. It is desired that no publicity be given
                            matter for time being.</p>

                        <p>35. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 28, July 17, 8 p.m., Foreign
                            Minister informs me today he will expedite Costa Rican studies for
                            purpose of initiating actual conversations for new treaty on September
                            1st. Foreign Minister, however, apparently is not as enthusiastic now
                            for new treaty as Government was last January because Germany, which
                            buys more from Costa Rica than it sells, is pressing for equitable
                            balancing of trade. Foreign Minister points out that the United States
                            now sells Costa Rica more than it buys and he shows no enthusiasm for
                            reducing any Costa Rican duties in view of Government’s need for import
                            revenues. At the same time he desires continuation of free entry into
                            the United States of chief Costa Rican products.</p>

                            to give public notice shortly of the intention to negotiate agreements

                            with Central America has finished its work on Schedule I—Guatemala,
                            viz., the concessions that this Government is to ask of Guatemala. This
                            Committee is now preparing a list of concessions to be sought from
                            Honduras and is endeavoring to complete this work by the middle of
                            January. It is then expected that discussion of Costa Rica will be
                            resumed and completed, to be followed by Nicaragua and El Salvador.</p>

                        <p>5. For Caffery from Welles.<note n="2" xml:id="d74fn2">Sumner Welles,
                                Assistant Secretary of State.</note> Márquez Sterling has been in to
                            see me repeatedly during the past 10 days. He has four times fixed a
                            definite date of departure for Habana, where he intended to take up his
                            duties as Secretary of State. This morning, he came to see me to advise
                            me that last night he had sent his irrevocable resignation to Dr.
                                Grau.<note n="3" xml:id="d74fn3">Dr. Ramón Grau San Martin,
                                Provisional President of Cuba.</note> The reasons for this, from
                            what he told me, were the refusal of his Government to adjust the
                            indebtedness incurred by Cuban army officers in American military
                            schools and the persistence of Grau in utilizing the services of
                            American confidential agents in the United States who alleged that
                            recognition by this Government could be obtained through their
                            connections.</p>
                        <p>Márquez Sterling spoke, however, in a very open manner of the situation
                            in Habana and of letters he had recently received from his friends
                            there. The impression he gave me was that he had reached the conclusion
                            that no peaceful adjustment of the problem was now possible.

                                n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0160"/>and increasingly urgent inquiries
                            at the Foreign Office as to British policy, pointing out that they
                            feared the drift of the situation. The Foreign Office stated that recent
                            reports from Habana were more reassuring than the views obtained by the
                            British Ambassador in Washington from the Department of State and that
                            the British Minister in Habana had been instructed to keep in touch with
                            you.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office further stated to the American Chargé d’Affaires in
                            London that they recognized that special considerations were involved in
                            the Cuban situation due to the Piatt Amendment,<note n="6"

                            had a similar situation existed in some other Latin American country
                            Great Britain would be on the brink of recognizing a regime similar to
                            the Grau San Martín Government. The Foreign Office concluded by
                            referring again to the urgent interests of British capital in Cuba; the
                            friendly nature of their present inquiry regarding the situation and the
                            desire of the British Government to cooperate with the United States in
                            the present situation rather than to take independent action.</p>
                        <p>The British Ambassador called at the State Department on January 4 and in
                            the course of a conversation with the Acting Secretary on the Cuban
                            situation admitted that the pressure being brought to bear on the
                            British Government to recognize the Grau San Martín regime came from the
                            property owners in Cuba and especially the Britishowned railway
                            interests. He was told that in the opinion of this Government
                            recognition of the present regime in Cuba would be a great mistake; that
                            the sentiment of the Latin American Governments in the great majority
                            was against such recognition. The British Ambassador was given the
                            latest picture of conditions in Cuba. There was no indication from the
                            British Ambassador that actual recognition of the Cuban <hi

                        <p>9. For Caffery from Welles. After changing his plans three times within
                            the past week, Márquez Sterling called this morning to tell me that he
                            had withdrawn his resignation and was proceeding to Habana tonight. It
                            is obvious that he is hopeful of his own selection as a compromise
                            candidate for the presidency.</p>
                        <pb n="95" xml:id="pg_95" facs="0161"/>
                        <p>He stated that upon his return to Habana he would request Grau to call a
                            full cabinet meeting at which he would read a declaration of his views
                            as to the policy which should be pursued with regard to the relations
                            between Cuba and the United States; that he would point out that all of
                            the recommendations he has offered Grau in the past four months have
                            been disregarded; and that he would urge upon Grau the necessity of
                            modifying the policy heretofore pursued by his Government with a view to
                            obtaining recognition by the United States and by the other Republics of
                            this hemisphere. He told me that unless Grau and his Government agree to
                            follow his recommendations he would resign his office and return
                            immediately to the United States.</p>
                        <p>He expressed no faith whatever in the negotiations of the Uruguayan
                            Minister, but stated that he felt that you could be of the utmost
                            assistance in furthering his efforts to solve the present problems.</p>
                        <p>In reply to an inquiry from him I stated that the policy of this
                            Government with regard to Cuba as announced by the President in his Warm

                        <p>5. The Uruguayan Minister continues his efforts for conciliation.
                            Mendieta’s sector is the only opposition group taking part.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime a number of “solutions” and “plans for conciliation” have
                            been suggested to me. None of these seems feasible at this juncture. The
                            opposition groups have been making demands that the government will not
                            accept; and the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities have been
                            continually asking what they must do to achieve recognition but at the
                            same time making declarations as to their maximum concessions which I
                            know to be unacceptable to the opposition. However, I see a gleam of
                            hope in the fact that while solutions and plans from both sides are
                            still impracticable, the suggestions I have recently received are an
                            improvement over suggestions received formerly.</p>
                        <p>I agree with former Ambassador Welles as to the inefficiency, ineptitude
                            and unpopularity with all the better classes in the country of the <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> government. It is supported only by the
                            army and ignorant masses who have been misled by Utopian promises.
                            However, <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0162"/>unless Dr. Grau decides
                            voluntarily to give up power it is my opinion that he can be forced to
                            do so only by the armed intervention of the United States unless there
                            is a break in the army which is now standing strongly behind the
                            government. The military have plenty of arms and ammunition and
                            realizing that they will be sheep exterminated in a successful
                            revolution, they will be fighting for their lives. The opposition
                            declare that they are organizing a revolution but it will be very
                            difficult for them to overcome the organized military forces. I find in
                            the opposition little tendency to compromise and an insistence that the
                            only way to clear up this situation is for us to intervene. They refuse
                            to believe our insistent declarations against intervention.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand matters cannot with impunity be allowed to drift
                            interminably in the direction they are now drifting: the <hi
                                rend="italic">de facto</hi> authorities in view of the fact that
                            they have no support from the better elements of the country are relying
                            more and more on radical and communistic elements and we may soon be
                            faced with the [<hi rend="italic">a?</hi>] very grave situation in
                            connection with the protection of our manifold interests on the
                            island.</p>
                        <p>The opposition groups at this time are not acting in complete harmony.
                            For instance, difference of opinion exists as to whether another
                            revolution should be attempted. The government has been able to draw
                            away a section of the Mendieta group by appointments to office while
                            some in the other groups apprehend that the Mendieta group may make a
                            private deal with the government in order to secure a strategic position
                            for the elections.</p>
                        <p>In the background there is constantly the distressing economic situation
                            in the interior; much actual hunger, misery and want—all due manifestly
                            to the sugar situation which is so bad at present that some American
                            owned mills do not seem interested in grinding. The recent difficulties
                            at Chaparra and Delicias (in which the Department is taking interest)
                            arise from the fact that the company can pay average field wages of only
                            about 15 cents a day.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, the government has called for elections April
                            22 for a Constitutional Assembly to meet May 20 but the opposition
                            groups declare they will not take part asserting that they do not
                            believe the government in spite of its repeated declarations on fair
                            elections. However, they declare that they will participate in the
                            elections if means can be found to provide for fair ones.</p>
                        <p>I am meeting Grau and Batista again on invitation tonight. I have been
                            told that they will make offer of “changes in the government”.</p>
                        <p>I hope to make definite recommendations to the Department soon.</p>

                        <p>7. Next to the last paragraph my telegram No. 5, January 10, 7 p.m. Last
                            night I discussed the situation at some length informally with Grau and
                            Batista. After much hesitation Grau stated that to his mind the
                            important issue of the day is that of fair elections. He then said in
                            effect: “I believe that I can guarantee fair elections if I remain in
                            the Presidency but if the opposition are convinced that I cannot do so I
                            will be willing to give place to a non-political successor to be chosen
                            by me from a panel of three names to be selected by the opposition on
                            condition that one of the names at least must be acceptable to me. I
                            would be willing to consent to a division of the Cabinet between
                            ourselves and the opposition groups.”</p>
                        <p>I thought it best not to pursue this conversation further last night in
                            order to give Grau time to think this over and also because I am not
                            convinced … that he would be allowed to resign by his Cabinet or the
                            student leaders in the Palace. I shall wait for further news from
                            Grau.</p>

                        <p>9. My telegram No. 5, January 10, 7 p.m. and No. 7, January 11, 7 p.m. As
                            the Department is aware it would be a hopeless task to get all of the
                            opposition groups to agree on a program: there are too many differences
                            of opinion among them: for instance the Mendieta group is interested in
                            elections while some of the other groups would rather pin their faith in
                            a revolution or the hope that we will intervene and put them into power;
                            in fact they are very indignant that we have not done so. I have made no
                            attempt at drawing the groups together on a program.</p>
                        <p>Batista asked me 3 days ago what we wanted done for recognition. I said
                            “I will lay down no specific terms; the matter of your government is a
                            Cuban matter and it is for you to decide what you will do about it”.
                            (Having in mind our reiterated declarations as to our position on
                            recognition.)</p>
                        <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0164"/>
                        <p>The night before last Batista had an interview with Mendieta in which
                            they discussed in great secrecy the possibility of Grau’s leaving the
                            Presidency and either Dr. Presno or Dr. Costales Latatu assuming that
                            office provisionally. They agreed either of these two men would be
                            acceptable.</p>
                        <p>Last night Batista decided that things were going so badly that he would
                            force Grau’s resignation at once but he was persuaded not to take
                            precipitous action by some of his friends.</p>
                        <p>Batista is to see Mendieta again this afternoon for the purpose of
                            discussing the possibility of the formation of a new government. They
                            have decided that either Mendieta himself or Costales Latatu should
                            assume the Presidency.</p>
                        <p>I do not mean the state of any of this is a certainty especially as the
                            attitude of Guiteras and his naval and military adherents is unknown;
                            also in view of what may eventuate out of the troubles of the Electric
                            Light Company this evening or the troubles of the Habana Electric
                            Railway (my telegrams No. 10 and 11, January 13, 6 p.m.;<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d79fn8">Neither printed.</note>) also in view of the fact
                            that there is a labor congress of 5,000 persons now going on at
                            Habana.</p>
                        <p>I have taken no part in these conversations but am keeping informed of
                            what is going on.</p>

                        <p>12. My 9, January 13, 5 p.m. Situation is very grave. However, Mendieta
                            tells me he is willing to assume the Presidency (provisionally of
                            course) at once but only if he knows in advance that the United States
                            will recognize him. Situation is such that some steps must be taken
                            tonight, Sunday, to secure change in the government very soon
                            thereafter. Batista tells me he will support Mendieta.</p>
                        <p>I respectfully request at once authority to recognize Mendieta in the
                            Presidency. If this is not done Batista will probably turn definitely to
                            the left with definite disaster for all our interests here (or declare
                            himself military dictator).</p>
                        <p>Mendieta, of course, would like to unite all the opposition but obviously
                            there is no time to discuss that now.</p>

                        <p>14. My No. 12, January 14, 3 p.m. [<hi rend="italic">a.m.</hi>] I think
                            it is safe to say that a government headed by Mendieta and supported by
                            Batista will represent a majority of the Cuban people: both of them
                            without question are extremely popular in very different sectors of the
                            public.</p>

                            is the President’s decision: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“It is of course impossible to pledge recognition of any
                                    individual or group before certain conditions are an
                                    accomplished fact. The position of the President has been made
                                    abundantly clear in previous statements. This Government will
                                    recognize a Cuban provisional Government which is substantially
                                    supported by the Cuban people and is able to maintain law, order
                                    and the normal functions of Government. A reiteration of this to
                                    any or all leaders or parties is entirely in order but we cannot
                                    be in a position of promising recognition to any individual or
                                    group in advance of the fulfillment of the conditions we have
                                    consistently set forth.”</p>

                            of his well-known vacillating tendency and reluctance to assume

                        <p>21. My telegram No. 20, January 15, 3 a.m. Grau last night verbally
                            expressed his willingness to resign. Officers junta adjourned in early
                            hours of the morning but reassembled at 6 a.m. and is still in session.
                            Batista before adjournment still preferred Mendieta but it developed
                            during the meeting that he would probably meet with <pb n="101"
                                xml:id="pg_101" facs="0167"/>armed opposition from the Navy and
                            extreme left if he attempted to put him into office. Notwithstanding
                            that, Batista would probably be prepared to go ahead with Mendieta if I
                            recommend it but I do not feel that I can do so partly because Mendieta
                            desires definite previous assurance from us which we cannot give.</p>

                        <p>24. My telegram No. 22, January 15, 2 p.m. After much delay today Grau
                            finally turned over the office of Provisional President to Hevia at 5
                            p.m., and proceeded to his private house. (Hevia will take oath of
                            office tomorrow.) I was asked to make a personal visit on Grau at once
                            for protection reasons and have done so (having in mind the attitude of
                            the opposition parties to him of course).</p>
                        <p>A mob around the Palace was dispersed by the troops shortly after Grau
                            left, with 1 killed and 14 wounded.</p>
                        <p>There is much nervousness in the city and possible danger of conflict
                            between Batista’s forces and those of the Cuban factions.</p>

                        <p>26. My telegram No. 24, January 15, 7 p.m. Hevia took oath at noon today.
                            Negotiations are still going on between him and the Mendieta group as to
                            that group’s participation in the Cabinet. Casanova, President of the
                            association of Cuban landowners, came to see me yesterday to tell that
                            his association would back Hevia. I heard on very reliable authority
                            that Guiteras passed most of last night telephoning around the island
                            denouncing Batista and making plans to call strikes [of] the telephone
                            and other American-owned public companies. He also spoke of the
                            possibility of a general strike. I am bringing this to the attention of
                            Hevia and Batista.</p>
                        <p>There has been no disturbance in Habana since yesterday afternoon’s
                            shooting and situation remains quiet.</p>
                        <p>My principal Latin American colleagues inform me that they will maintain
                            an attitude of observation and expectancy in this situation and that
                            they desire to continue to cooperate fully with us.</p>

                        <p>30. My telegram No. 26, January 16, 1 p.m. The Mendieta group has divided
                            as to whether or not to follow Mendieta’s lead in supporting Hevia, the
                            majority of the group this morning being in opposition to their chief.
                            However, Hevia is still making serious efforts to secure the support of
                            the entire group.</p>

                            lieutenant which he considered to be of much <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103"

                            <p>“I have just returned from an interview with President Hevia. He
                                expressed a desire that Mr. Caffery be informed of the following: A
                                general strike affecting public utilities is planned for 6 a.m.,
                                17th January. This strike is engineered by Guiteras. This strike
                                must be settled promptly, and peaceably, if possible.</p>
                            <p>He greatly desires some expression of confidence, or support, from
                                Mr. Caffery, feeling that such an expression would materially
                                strengthen his hand, and aid him in settling this strike.</p>
                            <p>When asked what strike ‘expression’ he wanted, he stated that he
                                meant any communication which could be interpreted as helpful or

                            full support of Mendieta group he has decided to declare Mendieta
                            President this afternoon. He may meet with armed resistance from the
                            Cuban Navy.</p>
                        <p>I do not know that this decision is final but he says now that he has

                        <p>39. My telegram No. 37, January 17, 3 p.m. Batista sends word that his
                            negotiations with Navy are proceeding favorably. He is optimistic of
                            reaching a peaceful solution.</p>

                        <p>42. My telegram No. 39, January 17, 7 p.m. Navy has agreed to withdraw
                            opposition to Mendieta. The road is clear for him to the Presidency.
                            However, he as usual is making last minute difficulties. The plan (if he
                            does not back out) is for all matters connected with the transmission of
                            powers to be handled exclusively by civilians, no military to
                            participate. The transmission may take place tonight.</p>
                        <p>Hevia a few minutes ago was drafting his resignation which he will offer
                            at once to the revolutionary junta.</p>

                            large public support. The communistic element will, of course, make
                            every effort to stir up trouble for it and is responsible for the strike
                            of employees of certain government departments and employees of the
                            Electric Company which is now in effect. Nevertheless the Government is
                            dealing firmly with the situation and it is my opinion that it will be
                            capable of maintaining law and order. There is a very evident feeling of
                            relief and enthusiasm throughout the city. I believe that most Latin
                            American representatives here will recommend immediate recognition.</p>

                                xml:id="d102fn16">Not printed.</note> I have the honor to report
                            that Dr. Grau San Martin sailed at noon on January 20 for Mexico, on the
                                <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0173"/>Ward Line steamer <hi
                                rend="italic">Oriente</hi>. A large crowd, composed chiefly of the
                            elements which supported Dr. Grau during his ill-fated regime, thronged
                            the Ward Line docks to see him off. He was likewise given further
                            parting cheers by a similar crowd gathered at La Punta as the <hi
                                rend="italic">Oriente</hi> steamed by Morro Castle.</p>
                        <p>Before sailing, according to <hi rend="italic">Alma Muter</hi>, Dr. Grau
                            wrote the following farewell message on board the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Oriente:</hi> “In saying au revoir to the Cuban people, I repeat
                            that I shall continue with unshakeable faith working for the liberty,
                            the dignity and the progress of our country.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. Grau’s decision to visit Mexico, where he at present plans to remain
                            for five or six months, was probably due to an invitation from the
                            Mexican Chargé d’Affaires to visit his country. Dr. Reyes Spindola felt
                            that conditions could more easily return to normalcy if Dr. Grau, around
                            whose person agitation might center, were absent from the country. He
                            proposes to suggest that the Mexican Government observe any possible
                            political activities Dr. Grau may engage in while in Mexico. The Mexican
                            Chargé d’Affaires was among those who went to the ship to see Dr. Grau
                            depart.</p>

                            States is approaching with the recognition of the Cuban Government,<note

                            these negotiations will take place is one of importance. In this
                            connection, at my request, the Commercial Attaché has prepared a
                            memorandum outlining various substantial reasons why the actual
                            negotiations should continue to be held in Habana rather than in
                            Washington. A copy of this memorandum is transmitted herewith. I desire
                            to state that I concur with the statements contained therein. While, of
                            course, the legal drafting of the final text of the treaty can obviously
                            be handled more satisfactorily in the Department, the detailed
                            negotiations should, in my opinion, continue to be held in Habana.</p>

                            <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Revision of the Reciprocity Treaty.</p>
                            <p>It is our feeling that the proposed revision of the treaty of
                                commercial reciprocity between the United States and Cuba should be
                                negotiated in Habana rather than in Washington; it being understood,
                                however, that the Department of State will be kept informed of
                                developments and that the general provisions will be prepared in the
                                Department of State with the cooperation of the Embassy.</p>
                            <p>Should negotiations be conducted in Washington, it would be necessary
                                to transfer to the Department of State the vast amount of material
                                available in the Embassy. This includes useful reports based upon
                                conferences with persons engaged in import and export trade,
                                industry and agriculture, letters, special studies, reference books
                                and charts. Moreover, the Cubans would be required to do likewise.
                                So as to <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0175"/>insure practical
                                revision of the treaty, it would be essential to send to Washington
                                the four members of the staff in the office of the Commercial
                                Attaché who have specialized in this work, all at considerable
                                expense and impairment of efficient functioning of the Embassy.</p>
                            <p>The office of the Commercial Attaché of the Embassy has prepared
                                considerable information on the subject, most of which was used as
                                the basis for preliminary discussions with officials of the Cuban
                                government at the meetings which took place last year. Since then,
                                additional data have been compiled, and new ideas have been
                                formulated. This material has guided the sub-committee of the
                                Inter-Departmental Committee in Washington in its study of the
                                proposed revision of the treaty. The findings of the sub-committee
                                are useful, but we do not believe that a duplication of effort would
                                be justified during the actual negotiations. We do feel, however,
                                that the experience of experts on the Inter-Departmental Committee
                                in Washington is such as to more than justify the preparation of the
                                general provisions there, after an exchange of ideas with the
                                Embassy.</p>
                            <p>It is obvious that the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] during the
                                negotiations, many problems will arise which will make it necessary
                                for our negotiators to discuss with reliable commercial contacts.
                                This would be very difficult in Washington, but would be relatively
                                simple in Habana in view of the fact that the office of the
                                Commercial Attaché is in touch with practically all the important
                                business men in this country, whether Cubans or foreigners. It is
                                within the realm of possibility that in the course of negotiations
                                price changes, new competition or other disturbing factors may
                                arise, and that there might be some delay in bringing them to the
                                attention of our negotiators in Washington; while in Habana they
                                would be known to our negotiators at once.</p>
                            <p>While it would be possible for the Embassy to elaborate on the
                                reports on domestic industries, which have been submitted to
                                Washington, from time to time, it is obvious that the negotiators
                                should be men who are thoroughly familiar with conditions of the
                                country. The members of the staff who would be delegated to
                                negotiate the commercial treaty have a full knowledge of conditions
                                in Cuba, and are well qualified to distinguish between natural and
                                artificial industries and the amount of tariff protection which they
                                should enjoy.</p>
                            <p>It would be more advantageous and economical for the Cuban government
                                to negotiate the commercial treaty in Habana. The latter is very
                                important, in view of the depressed financial condition of the
                                government. Moreover, as the basic data are available here, actual
                                negotiation of the commercial treaty would be expedited.</p>
                            <p>The staff of the Commercial Attaché has been kept intact in
                                anticipation of the revision of the commercial treaty in Habana. Two
                                members of the staff, who received their notification of separation
                                    <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0176"/>from the service last
                                year, have been retained for the express purpose of assisting in
                                revision of the treaty. We believe that their participation in the
                                meetings with the representatives of the Cuban government will be
                                extremely valuable and practical.</p>
                            <p>In brief, we are confident that if the negotiation [is?] carried on
                                in Habana, that revision of the treaty would be expedited and that
                                it would be more economical and practical for Cuba and the United
                                States.</p>

                            take time, Torriente<note n="20" xml:id="d106fn20">Cosme de la

                            would be feasible for the President to obtain authority to increase the
                            Cuban preferential on sugar imported into the United States in
                            compensation for a general blanket increased preferential on American
                            imports into Cuba which could be promptly negotiated by means of an
                            exchange of notes. He states that the Cuban Provisional Government has
                            the authority to increase the American preferential.</p>

                        <p>161. I had a preliminary discussion on the commercial treaty revision
                            yesterday with the Secretaries of State, Treasury, and Agriculture, and
                            I am to meet them again Monday.</p>

                                    reciprocal concessions on Cuban fruits and vegetables? And can

                            <p>It is agreed that the High Contracting Parties will maintain consular
                                invoice fees on a fixed basis not to exceed $5.00 each or on an ad
                                valorem basis not to exceed 5% of the value at the point of origin
                                of the shipment. In the event either Party maintains this charge on
                                an ad valorem basis, it shall grant to the other a 50% preferential
                                in such charge.<note n="‡" xml:id="d112fn3"><p>The American
                                        delegation is not unanimous as to this article because it is
                                        feared that the granting of the preferential on the consular
                                        fees might be interpreted as an admission by the Cuban
                                        Government that this fee is tantamount to an additional
                                        import duty. The treaties between Cuba and Spain (and other
                                        countries) bind the Cuban import duties on specified
                                        products so that this admission might justify a claim on the
                                        part of these countries for complete exemption from this
                                        charge on the commodities so bound.</p>

                        <p>References have been made in the course of the debate on the tariff bill

                            agricultural products. There is no truth whatsoever in these statements.
                            There are now no negotiations involving tariff reductions in progress

                            telegram No. 43 of February 6, 1934, authorizing you to commence
                            negotiations for a revision of the reciprocity treaty with Cuba, to your
                            telegram No. 161 of February 17, and to the Department’s telegraphic
                            reply No. 51 of February 21, and to a memorandum of the Commercial
                            Attaché of February 17,<note n="23" xml:id="d114fn23">Memorandum not
                                found in Department files.</note> citing certain basic questions
                            which will present themselves for decision in the course of the
                            negotiations. With reference to the questions raised by the Commercial
                            Attaché the following considerations are submitted for your information
                            and guidance.</p>
                        <p>(1) Can increases in duties be requested on certain highly competitive
                            products of foreign countries?</p>
                        <p>The Department considers that the general rule should be to seek no
                            increases of rates of duty on importations from foreign countries. In
                            this connection, however, the Department is sending you a further
                            instruction making certain observations on this point, (<hi
                                rend="italic">a</hi>) It is inconsistent with the general policy of
                            the Administration to encourage the raising of foreign tariff rates,
                            even when the United States would seem to benefit in the short run. We
                            would resent similar action by <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0184"
                            />foreign countries, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) It is possible that
                            dumping by foreign countries may in some cases be a proper subject of
                            concern from the standpoint of the United States. Such a situation
                            should, however, be met by an application of anti-dumping provisions
                            against the particular importations which have been sold at less than
                            their foreign market value or cost of production, or of provisions
                            designed to offset bounties which particular importations may enjoy,
                            rather than by subjecting all importations of a product to penalties
                            which are justified only with respect to a portion of them.</p>
                        <p>(2) Is it contrary to the policy set forth under (1) above to request a
                            consolidation of a consumption tax with a duty in order that the
                            preference obtained on the duty would also apply on the tax? <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Where there is a genuine consumption tax, that is, one levied
                                    on a substantial domestic production at the same rate as upon
                                    imports (e. g., our excise tax on cigars), it is not to be
                                    consolidated with the duty nor is a preference therein to be
                                    sought.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>Where the consumption tax is a disguised import duty collected
                                    in fact almost entirely upon imports, the American product
                                    should get the preference therein, whether or not consolidated
                                    with the duty. You are requested to refer to the Department for
                                    decision all borderline cases.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>(3) Would a request for the application of the maximum rate of duty
                            provided for in the Cuban tariff be considered inconsistent with the
                            principles set forth above?</p>
                        <p>No proposal should be made by the United States whereby foreign goods
                            which now pay the Cuban general rates would be made subject to the
                            higher “maximum” tariff rates.</p>
                        <p>(4) Can the United States request seasonal reductions in Cuban import
                            duties on agricultural products without offering reciprocal concessions
                            on such products?</p>
                        <p>The Department suggests that the discussion of seasonal reductions in
                            duties on fruits and vegetables be deferred until this Government is in
                            a position to indicate what concessions, if any, it will be able to
                            offer in the way of seasonal reductions on Cuban products. Your
                            attention is called, however, to the existence in the present Cuban
                            tariff of provision for seasonal tariffs on potatoes and onions.</p>
                        <p>(5) Shall the provisions of Article 1 of the present treaty, which
                            provides for free entry into the United States of products on the free
                            list when the treaty was concluded, continue in effect?</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the negotiations is to improve conditions for trade and
                            the presumption must be that articles now free of duty will be
                            guaranteed free entry. It may be necessary, however, to make an
                            exception to this rule in the case of some products, such as avocados.
                                <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0185"/>As soon as investigations
                            which are being made here regarding this matter have been completed, the
                            Department will instruct you further.</p>
                        <p>(6) To what extent can the United States appropriately request reductions
                            in existing Cuban internal taxes?</p>
                        <p>The United States now levies internal taxes on Cuban tobacco. In
                            addition, a bill is now pending in Congress<note n="24"
                                xml:id="d114fn24">See H. R. 8861, <hi rend="italic">Congressional
                                    Record</hi>, vol. 78, pt. 5. p. 5691.</note> to make Cuba’s
                            principal export product, sugar, a basic commodity for the purposes of
                            the Agricultural Adjustment Act,<note n="25" xml:id="d114fn25">Approved
                                May 12, 1933; 48 Stat. 31.</note> and to make it liable to a
                            processing tax. Thus, if this bill is enacted into law, Cuba’s two most
                            important export products would be liable to internal taxes in this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>It does not follow, however, that this fact should necessarily prevent
                            the United States from requesting reductions in Cuban consumption taxes.
                            The question above propounded can not be dealt with in principle, but
                            only in relation to particular products. Whether a request for a
                            reduction in the internal tax on a product is justified depends upon
                            various factors, including the amount of the customs duties and other
                            charges to which the article is subject and the amount of the reduction
                            in the customs duty which is offered. If, for example, a material
                            increase in the trade in a given product can be effected by a reduction
                            in the import duty only, a reduction in the internal tax may be
                            foregone.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, it would simplify the problem to provide so far as
                            possible for the maintenance of the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> or
                            for the establishment of specified limits with respect to internal taxes
                            on products dealt with in the agreement, and to make the desired trade
                            adjustment through the medium of the import duties. However, there may
                            be instances in which the customs duty on a product is so low and the
                            internal tax on the product is so high that even the complete abolition
                            of the import duty would not give the desired opportunity for trade. In
                            such cases a reduction in the internal tax should, of course, be
                            requested.</p>
                        <p>(7) May a revision of the consular invoice fee, which in effect amounts
                            to an additional import duty, of five percent ad valorem, be
                            requested?</p>
                        <p>You may request reduction of the consular fee to a nominal amount, or, if
                            in your opinion it is more desirable, its consolidation with import
                            duties. All charges on imports, other than customs duties, or consular
                            fees, if not reduced by the agreement or consolidated with customs
                            duties should be bound at present levels or within agreed upon limits.
                            The agreement might well contain a general provision whereby, in so far
                            as concerns articles with respect to which customs <pb n="120"
                                xml:id="pg_120" facs="0186"/>concessions or commitments have been
                            made under the agreement, charges of all kinds which have not been
                            specifically provided for shall not be increased, and whereby no new
                            charges of other kinds shall be imposed.</p>
                        <p>(8) Is it the intention completely to revise the existing treaty and
                            submit the redrafted treaty to Congress for ratification at the present
                            session?</p>
                        <p>The Department is not in a position to inform you at the present moment
                            of the form that may seem most advisable for the ultimate trade
                            agreement that you are now working on. If the tariff proposal now before
                            Congress should be enacted (H. R. 8687 of which a copy is attached<note
                                n="26" xml:id="d114fn26">For text of law approved June 12, 1934, see
                                48 Stat. 943.</note>) it might be that the powers conferred upon the
                            Executive by that bill will be sufficient to cover the arrangement with
                            the Cuban Government and that the arrangement could be put into effect
                            at once as an Executive Agreement. However, in the event that the treaty
                            calls for concessions by the American Government not within the range of
                            powers conferred upon the Executive by this bill, or in the event that
                            this bill fails of passage, the arrangement would have to be presented
                            to Congress for ratification.</p>
                        <p>(9) Shall the concessions to be granted by the United States to Cuba on
                            products other than sugar be discussed with the Cuban delegation?</p>
                        <p>No decision can now be reached regarding such concessions. You may state
                            to the Cuban authorities, however, that you will receive any requests
                            they may desire to make, and transmit them to the Department for
                            consideration. It is extremely important under present circumstances to
                            avoid any publicity whatever regarding the concessions which might be
                            offered by the United States.</p>
                        <p>(10) Shall the Embassy prepare a draft of the general provisions of the
                            treaty for submission to the Department for approval?</p>
                        <p>The Department will prepare and submit to you as soon as possible in
                            outline form a draft of the proposed agreement. The Embassy should
                            prepare the texts of any special provisions which it deems advisable to
                            include therein and submit them to the Department for approval.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that for the present the Embassy concentrate on the
                            schedule of concessions to be obtained from Cuba, since this part of the
                            agreement involves the greatest technical difficulties and will consume
                            the greatest amount of time. It is recognized that the inability of this
                            Government to indicate what concessions can be granted to Cuba greatly
                            increases the difficulty of this task. As matters now stand, however,
                            there is no help for it. The Department can only suggest that the
                            discussions proceed on the assumption that concessions will be made by
                            the United States and on the basis that concessions <pb n="121"
                                xml:id="pg_121" facs="0187"/>offered by Cuba at this stage are
                            tentative and subject to the granting of reciprocal concessions by the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>In the future the Department desires that all proposals, including
                            counter-proposals, regarding the concessions desired by the United
                            States be submitted to the Department before they are submitted to the
                            Cuban negotiators in order that the views of the Departments of
                            Agriculture and Commerce and of the Tariff Commission may be obtained
                            thereon. Arrangements will be made whereby such proposals will receive
                            prompt consideration here.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the questions raised by the Commercial Attaché there are
                            certain further principles by which you should be guided in the conduct
                            of the negotiations, as follows:</p>
                        <p>(11) It must be borne in mind that the United States, and possibly also
                            Cuba, will desire to enter into negotiations for the promotion of trade
                            with other countries. From this standpoint the preferences granted by
                            Cuba and the United States to each other are significant. In this
                            connection consideration must be given both to the form and to the
                            amount of the preference.</p>
                        <p>The preference may take the form of a percentual reduction in general
                            rates, whatever those rates may be. This is the form employed in the
                            existing treaty. Or it may take the form of an absolute margin of
                            preference expressed as a specified sum per unit of goods, or a
                            specified percentage ad valorem, i. e., a percentage of the value of the
                            goods. This is the form suggested in the draft agreement enclosed with
                            your despatch No. 46 of March 9, 1934. The form of preference provided
                            for in the existing treaty seems preferable for the following
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The preference in its absolute form sets a
                            limit to reduction in rates. The lowest rate that could be imposed on
                            goods of third countries would be the sum per unit or the ad valorem
                            percentage representing the agreed-upon margin of preference. The
                            preference in its relative form (percentual reduction in general rates)
                            on the other hand, would allow complete freedom with respect to
                            reductions in rates. While there may be little likelihood in the
                            immediate future of either country desiring to lower its rates to third
                            countries to the extent that this implies, it is nevertheless desirable
                            in principle that no limit to rate reductions be imposed.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The form of preference provided for in the
                            existing agreement permits some mitigation of the discrimination against
                            third countries. A reduction in the general rate results in a reduction
                            in the absolute margin of preference. It therefore permits the United
                            States or Cuba not only to offer a third country a reduction in the rate
                            payable on imports from that country but at the same time to afford some
                            measure of relief from the discrimination to which its trade is subject.
                            Thus, on the basis of a 20% preference on general rates: <pb n="122"

                            </table></p>
                        <p>Any such reduction in the margin of preference, however, would tend to be
                            offset by the fact that it would necessarily be accompanied by a
                            reduction in the duties paid by Cuba and by the consequent improvement
                            in the competitive position of Cuban producers as compared with those in
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>The size of the percentual preferences granted may likewise be important
                            from the standpoint of negotiations with some third countries. In any
                            such negotiations the third country concerned is likely to demand at
                            least that the absolute margin of preference shall be no greater than
                            that existing before the treaty between the United States and Cuba was
                            revised. A mere reduction in the general rate is not likely to satisfy
                            the third country concerned if the margin of preference to Cuba or the
                            United States, as the case may be, is such that the third country
                            anticipates that it will be unable to compete. The greater the increase
                            in the percentage of preference, the greater must be the reduction in
                            rates in any negotiations with a third country, in order to restore or
                            reduce the absolute margin of preference now existing. If, in the
                            present negotiations, percentages of preference should be materially
                            increased on products which are likely to be important in negotiations
                            with third countries, greater reductions in duty may be demanded by such
                            third countries than budgetary or protective requirements will
                            permit.</p>
                        <p>In view of the considerations above set forth it seems to the Department
                            advisable (1) to state the preference in the form of a percentual
                            reduction to the United States based on the lowest rate at any time
                            applicable to any other foreign country, and (2) to increase the
                            preference only on articles of which Cuba or the United States, as the
                            case may be, is the chief source or one of the principal sources of
                            imports into the other. There may be some articles of which Cuba or the
                            United States is the chief source or one of the principal sources of
                            imports into the other but which may be an important factor in future
                            negotiations with some third country. Any representations by Cuba or the
                            United States that in such circumstances an increase in preference
                            should be foregone should receive sympathetic consideration.</p>
                        <p>It is recognized that in the case of some products the observance of
                            these principles may involve a sacrifice of immediate expansion with
                            respect to the trade of Cuba and the United States with each other. <pb
                                n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0189"/>But it would preserve, both for
                            Cuba and the United States, the opportunity to expand their trade in
                            other directions.</p>
                        <p>(12) It is intended that the new trade agreement will provide not merely
                            for specified minimum percentage preferences to the United States, but
                            that the rates of duty on important specified American products be bound
                            as to maxima by the agreement. It is suggested that rates might be bound
                            on all such important articles except those with respect to which such
                            limitation would clearly be of greater benefit to some foreign country
                            than to the United States.</p>
                        <p>(13) The emphasis should be on obtaining reductions in duties rather than
                            on obtaining increased preferences. The Department considers that there
                            has been too great a tendency in connection with proposals submitted by
                            the Embassy to seek increased preferences. There is a strong presumption
                            in any case against seeking a preference in excess of 50%. A preference
                            of as much as 50% should be sought only in exceptional cases.</p>
                        <p>(14) A balance of the advantages offered by the parties to a treaty can
                            seldom be effected by each party granting like concessions on like
                            products. It is the trade importance of the concessions granted, not the
                            kind of concessions, which must be compared in determining the
                            equivalence of the concessions granted by the countries concerned. Cuba
                            exports a relatively few articles of great importance in the economy of
                            that country, while the United States exports to Cuba numerous products
                            none of which, taken alone, represents a large proportion of the trade.
                            A substantial concession by the United States to Cuba on sugar will be
                            equivalent, therefore, when measured in terms of trade advantage, to
                            concessions by Cuba on numerous products of the United States. These
                            considerations should be kept in mind in connection with such questions
                            as that raised under point (4) above, namely, the relation of seasonal
                            reductions in duty by Cuba to seasonal reductions in duty by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>(15) In order to stabilize the production and marketing of sugar in the
                            areas supplying the domestic American market, there has been introduced
                            into the Congress a bill which, in effect, will permit the establishment
                            of quotas for these areas.<note n="27" xml:id="d114fn27">H. R. 8861. For

                            use of the figures for the last three years as the basis for fixing
                            quotas would result in an approximate balance between supply and
                            consumption. On this basis marketing of Cuban sugar would be 1,944,000
                            short tons, as compared with 1,608,000 short tons in 1933, an increase
                            of nearly 25 percent. In view, however, of the possibility of change in
                            these figures and of the possibility that the bill might not pass, you
                            should not at this time discuss the matter with the Cuban
                            authorities.</p>

                        <p>The bill before Congress concerning sugar makes sugar beets and sugar
                            cane basic agricultural commodities for the purposes of the Agricultural
                            Adjustment Act, thereby making them liable to a processing tax. In order
                            that the levy of this internal tax will not increase prices the pending
                            bill provides that in no event shall the rate of the processing tax
                            exceed the amount by which the tariff on sugar is reduced below the
                            present rate of import duty. In this connection, your attention is
                            called to the preliminary report of the Tariff Commission on sugar,
                            which finds that the tariff on Cuban raw sugar (96°) need be only 1.50
                            cents per pound, instead of 2.00 cents per pound to equalize production
                            costs.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with the general instruction
                            of this date setting forth the general principles to be followed in
                            negotiation of a commercial treaty between this country and Cuba, the
                            Department wishes to transmit one supplementary element. This is in
                            connection with the general principle numbered (1) “The Department
                            considers that the general rule should be to seek no increases of rates
                            of duty on importations from foreign countries”.</p>
                        <p>The above-stated principle is one which the Department wishes strictly to
                            follow in all ordinary circumstances and conditions, and it represents
                            the position which the Department has assumed in regard to trade
                            agreements entered into between third countries. However, a condition
                            extraordinary in some respects is presented by the recent trend of
                            Japanese competition, which it is presumed has also manifested itself in
                            the Cuban market. This Japanese competition is made the more intense and
                            difficult by virtue of the great decline in the value of the Japanese
                            currency; there exists a possibility that within the treaty period this
                            decline may proceed further, thereby accentuating the difficulties of
                            competition and leading to the offer of Japanese goods in the Cuban
                            markets at prices even more markedly low than those at which some
                            Japanese goods are already being offered.</p>
                        <p>This is a contingency which the Department feels should be guarded
                            against in the drafting of the treaty with Cuba. It would be unfortunate
                            if after a lapse of time it should result that American trade advantages
                            secured in Cuba in return for the advantages given Cuba (in the field of
                            sugar only as the result of a very considerable effort) did not develop
                            as expected because of unusual Japanese competition.</p>
                        <pb n="125" xml:id="pg_125" facs="0191"/>
                        <p>It is therefore suggested that the Embassy make a careful study of the
                            different branches of Cuban trade in which it appears that Japanese
                            sales effort and competition in the Cuban market has grown markedly
                            greater during the past two years, and report back to the Department as
                            regards those items with recommendations. It may be that in regard to
                            some of the items in question it will be found advisable to depart from
                            the general principle laid down above.</p>

                            Instructions Nos. 60 and 61 of April 3, 1934.</p>
                        <p>At your request we are presenting our comments on the general instruction
                            for the revision of the reciprocity treaty with Cuba as set forth in the
                            confidential instructions from the Department of State of April 3,
                            1934.</p>
                        <p>In regard to increases of rates of duty on importations from foreign
                            countries treated with in the supplement of April 3rd, we are including
                            in a separate memorandum our views on Japanese and Belgian competition
                            in products on which we feel that it is desirable to request an increase
                            of the general import duties in order to meet or remove this
                            competition.</p>
                        <p>In Sub-section A of Section No. 1, the Department treats of the
                            possibility of employing anti-dumping regulations on imports which are
                            sold at less than the foreign market value or cost of production. There
                            is at present provision in the Cuban customs tariff for application of
                            the maximum duties against foreign dumping, but it has never been
                            applied. Our views on anti-dumping provisions to be included in the
                            treaty are set forth in Paragraph 5 of Article V of the draft of March
                            6, 1934, which presents our proposals for general provisions to be
                            included in the treaty.</p>
                        <p>We concur with the Department that the treaty should contain antidumping
                            provisions, but suggest that the treaty article be limited to the
                            dumping of third countries. However, the Department may desire to add an
                            article similar to Article III of the agreement with Colombia.<note
                                n="30" xml:id="d116fn30"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_249"><hi

                                        rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, p. 249</ref>.</note> It is
                            important to remember that the Cuban Government, as <pb n="126"
                                xml:id="pg_126" facs="0192"/>constituted, is not in a position
                            successfully to administer anti-dumping regulations. The Government
                            lacks facilities for making the necessary investigations in foreign
                            countries and is also hesitant to employ such drastic measures in view
                            of the possibility of antagonizing foreign countries. In the light of
                            this fact it is felt that we should disregard the possibility of
                            anti-dumping regulations being enforced in Cuba and, therefore, we
                            should protect our position as far as possible by increasing the spread
                            between the general duty and the duty to the United States by increasing
                            the preferentials.</p>
                        <p>We agree with the Department’s statement in Section 2(<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) regarding the consolidation of the consumption tax with the
                            import duty whenever the consumption tax is a disguised import duty.
                            There are many instances which are already known to the
                            interdepartmental Committee and therefore it will not be necessary to
                            treat with this subject in detail.</p>
                        <p>Razor blades are manufactured locally from imported steel. Although the
                            manufacturers are required by law to pay the consumption tax, their
                            prices are such that if they paid the consumption tax to the Government
                            they would operate at a loss. Imported razor blades pay the consumption
                            tax at the time of importation. Consequently they are at a disadvantage
                            in competing with the local products. In this instance we are
                            recommending that the consumption tax be imposed on the raw material at
                            the time of importation. This would yield more revenue to the Government
                            and would place our manufacturers in a better competitive position with
                            the local firms. The same is true of rayon knit goods, hosiery, and
                            similar products. In the report on the revision of the textile schedule,
                            which was submitted on March 23, 1934,<note n="31" xml:id="d116fn31">Not
                                printed.</note> we suggested that the consumption tax on the
                            finished goods be imposed on the yarn and collected at the customhouse.
                            Although we do not know of any border line cases, we will bear in mind
                            the instructions of the Department and will refer such cases to the
                            Department for decision.</p>
                        <p>We agree with the Department’s statement in Section 6 that it would be
                            advisable to provide so far as possible for the maintenance of the <hi
                                rend="italic">statics quo</hi> or for the establishment of specified
                            limits of internal taxes with respect to products dealt with in the
                            agreement. However, there are some instances in which internal taxes are
                            discriminatory or serve as an additional burden on imports, and in many
                            instances our end cannot be accomplished through reduction of import
                            duty only. Therefore, it would be desirable to ask for a reduction in
                            particular internal taxes. Some of the outstanding cases are cigarettes,
                            playing cards, meat products, automobiles, and textiles. In a few other
                            instances we should probably request a decrease in certain internal
                            taxes, <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0193"/>but of course before
                            doing so, the Department would have an opportunity to study our
                            proposals.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the consular invoice fee, the Department states in
                            Section 7 that the Embassy may “request reduction of the consular fee to
                            a nominal amount, or if in your opinion it is most desirable, the
                            consolidation with import duties”. Consolidation of this fee with the
                            import duty would be an admission on the part of the Cuban Government
                            that the consular fee is an import duty and as such it could not be
                            applied to products imported from Spain and France, since it is
                            specifically provided in the treaties with these countries that import
                            duties on products mentioned in the treaties may not be increased.<note

                            feeling that the most we can expect to obtain is a uniform reduction of
                            the consular fee from 5 per cent to 2½ per cent ad valorem. It seems to
                            us that the question of where and when the fee is imposed is strictly an
                            internal matter and that therefore we should not interfere. Some
                            American interests would prefer to have it levied at the time of
                            importation of the shipment and others at port of shipment. The
                            important thing for us is to secure a reduction of the fee, if possible,
                            to 2½ per cent ad valorem. Although this will represent a reduction of
                            revenue to the Government, we hope to be able to com pensate for it in
                            other parts of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Section 9 of the instructions, regarding concessions to
                            be granted by the United States to Cuba on products other than sugar, we
                            have carefully avoided discussion of these products and when the subject
                            has been approached we have told the Cuban delegates that the most we
                            can do is to submit their proposals to Washington for consideration.</p>
                        <p>In regard to special provisions for the treaty mentioned in Section 10,
                            your attention is invited to the fact that proposed revisions were
                            submitted by us on March 6, 1934.<note n="33" xml:id="d116fn33">See
                                proposals transmitted with despatch No. 46, March 9, 1934, from the
                                Ambassador in Cuba, <ref target="#pg_112">p. 112</ref>.</note> Some
                            of these provisions are very important and if it is at all possible it
                            is our desire that they be retained. It will be very useful for us to
                            receive the Department’s draft of the special provisions as soon as
                            possible in order that the treaty may be expedited. In fact, we have
                            made arrangements for special discussions of the treaty draft as soon as
                            we receive suggestions from the Department. Since the negotiation of the
                            treaty articles may require more time than the negotiation of the
                            schedules, the Department will appreciate the importance of sending its
                            draft to us in the very near future.</p>
                        <p>Needless to say, we are disappointed to learn that the Department
                            disapproves in Section 11, of our principle of the absolute
                            preferential. <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0194"/>It is entirely
                            probable that as the result of the instruction, Cuba will negotiate
                            treaties with other countries and that by reducing the general duty the
                            advantages obtained by the United States in the provisions of the treaty
                            will be lost. While it is not our intention to forestall such
                            negotiations, it is our earnest hope that the treaty will guarantee a
                            definite margin of preference over foreign competition.</p>
                        <p>In exchange for a known sacrifice of approximately thirty or forty
                            million dollars annually in the duty on sugar, we feel that the United
                            States should accept nothing less than an absolute preference.</p>
                        <p>Originally we had planned that the general rates would be minimum rates
                            and rates to the United States would be maximum, thus preventing any
                            reduction in the general rates but permitting that possibility with
                            respect to rates to the United States.</p>
                        <p>However, we have compromised on the absolute preferential plan which
                            would permit reduction in general rates of duty, yet protect the value
                            of the concessions obtained at the time of signature. On this basis Cuba
                            could reduce general duties but the value of the preferential to the
                            United States would be retained as shown in the following table: <table

                        <p>The objection to the absolute plan on the ground that it sets a limit to
                            the reduction of general rates is true if the plan is driven to its
                            logical extreme. That theoretical objection should not be given such
                            weight as to overturn the absolute preferential plan with its known
                            safeguards to American commerce.</p>
                        <p>The Department has been informed that the Canadian Government has
                            expressed a desire to the Cuban Government to negotiate a new treaty,
                            but the Cuban Government has stated that it will not do so until the new
                            treaty with the United States has been completed. In the event of a
                            treaty with Canada, it is reasonable to assume that the Canadians will
                            insist upon a lower import duty on potatoes, flour, fresh fruits, and
                            lumber.</p>
                        <p>As Cuba enjoys a substantial favorable balance of visible trade with
                            Great Britain, it follows that that country will negotiate a treaty to
                            protect the sale of textiles, iron and steel products, machinery, Indian
                            rice, and some foodstuffs.</p>
                        <p>Although we do not have definite proof, we believe that the Chilean
                            Government will endeavor to negotiate a treaty with Cuba for the
                            reduction of duties on beans, oats, hay, onions, and fruits.</p>
                        <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0195"/>
                        <p>In the second instruction, No. 61, of April 3, 1934, the Department
                            indicates that it may be desirable to seek increased general rates on
                            certain items. Obviously that would be done for the purpose of
                            increasing our margin of preference. Is it not inconsistent to go to the
                            extreme of asking for an increase in general rates in order to widen our
                            margin of preferential and yet leave the way open to a reduction of that
                            margin?</p>
                        <p>We are in sympathy with the Department’s attitude to establish principles
                            to guide in negotiating treaties with other countries, but we believe
                            that our Government should continue to make Cuba the exception to our
                            commercial treaty policy and that therefore our trade with Cuba should
                            receive special consideration.</p>
                        <p>The Department indicates in Section 12 its intention that the rates of
                            duty on important specified American products be bound as to maxima by
                            the agreement. While the interdepartmental committee made many
                            recommendations as to increasing the preferential without binding the
                            rate, our negotiations have disclosed that the Cuban delegation is
                            prepared to bind all products as to maxima by the agreement. Since this
                            is more advantageous to the United States, it is suggested that all such
                            rates be bound.</p>
                        <p>The Department states in Section 13 that it considers that there has been
                            too great a tendency in connection with the proposals submitted by the
                            Embassy to seek increased preferences. The Department states that the
                            emphasis should be on obtaining reduction in duty rather than on
                            obtaining increased preferences. The Department is evidently not aware
                            that the Cuban Government is strongly disinclined to reduce general
                            rates of duty, and consequently the only practical way to accomplish
                            reduced duty to the United States is by asking for a sharply increased
                            preferential. The chairman of the Cuban delegation has several times
                            made the definite statement that we are engaged in a revision of the
                            reciprocity treaty, not the Cuban Tariff, and consequently general rates
                            of duty should not be reduced.</p>

                        <p>In response to the Department’s instruction No. 61 of April 3, 1934,
                            directing the Embassy to make a careful study of the different branches
                                <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0196"/>of Cuban trade in which it
                            appears that Japanese sales effort and competition in the Cuban market
                            has grown markedly greater in the past two years, there follows a
                            discussion of items in which Japanese products have actually displaced
                            American products. At present there are several representatives of
                            Japanese firms in Habana offering a wide variety of lines competitive
                            with American exports. In addition, Japanese exporters are carrying on
                            extensive correspondence with Cuban and American firms in Cuba, quoting
                            prices far below those of similar American products. Copies of typical
                            letters and quotations are enclosed.<note n="35" xml:id="d117fn35">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Our trade contacts state that Japanese exporters are constantly
                            increasing their sales activities and extending the variety of their
                            lines. In self defense, some American firms doing business in Cuba have
                            been forced to purchase Japanese products in order to compete. This is
                            especially so in the case of textiles. The most important textile mill
                            in Cuba—American-owned—has been obliged to place large orders for yarn
                            in Japan in order to reduce the price of its finished products to a
                            level competitive with similar Japanese finished products.</p>
                        <p>In view of the general policy of the Governments both of the United
                            States and Cuba not to increase general rates of duty, our suggestions
                            for increased general rates have been limited to the outstanding cases
                            of actual competition.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">1. <hi rend="italic">Cotton Yarn.</hi></p>
                        <p>In the cotton section of the textile schedule we have asked for an
                            increase in the general duty only on cotton yarn, from $1.50 to $3.00
                            per 100 kilograms with a preference of 50 per cent to the United States.
                            While prices of cotton yarn fluctuate considerably, in general, Japanese
                            prices c. i. f. Habana are about 20 per cent below American prices.</p>
                        <p>No request was made for an increased general duty on cotton textiles
                            since nothing less than the maximum duty with a preference of 60 to 75
                            per cent would have been satisfactory. Such a request would not only
                            have been deemed excessive by the Cuban delegates but would, if granted,
                            provide so much additional protection as to encourage the establishment
                            of new mills in Cuba.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">2. Rayon Yarn.</hi></p>
                        <p>In the rayon sections of the textile schedule, we have asked for an
                            increase in the general duty only on rayon yarn from $0.20 to $0.85 per
                            100 kilograms with a preference of 50 per cent to the United States. In
                            general, Japanese rayon prices c. i. f. Habana are quoted at about 50
                            per cent of the American yarn.</p>
                        <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0197"/>
                        <p>The situation in respect of rayon piece goods is similar to that of
                            cotton yard goods. In order to overcome the tremendous difference in
                            price, it would have been necessary to request an increase to the
                            maximum duty and a preference of from 65 per cent to 75 per cent. With
                            such rates of duty, the cost to the Cuban consumer would be greatly
                            increased, and the development of the rayon textile industry in Cuba
                            would be artificially encouraged. Such a development would be as
                            detrimental to American trade as is the Japanese competition and
                            consequently the request is not being made.</p>
                        <p>In the cases of cotton piece goods, rayon piece goods and
                            toothbrushes—the three outstanding items of the textile schedule in
                            which Japan has already taken over a large percentage of our trade—we
                            have been repeatedly told by American manufacturers and importers that
                            in their opinion no duty or preferential will be sufficient to offset
                            the price difference on the Japanese goods. As the Department is well
                            aware, these interests have constantly urged the establishment of quotas
                            on these products based on imports from Cuba.</p>
                        <p>In view of the general antipathy toward the quota system, we felt that
                            the best we could do was to secure as high a preference as possible on
                            the present duties, in the hope that when the general economic condition
                            of Cuba improves, the proximity of the United States and the superior
                            styling of American textiles, coupled with the increased preferentials
                            would enable us to regain some of the former business.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">3. <hi rend="italic">Incandescent Bulbs.</hi></p>
                        <p>In 1930, the Cuban market consumed 1,840,502 lamps valued at
                            approximately $247,693, all of which were imported. On the basis of
                            units, the United States supplied 56 per cent of the total during that
                            year and Japan 4 per cent. Japanese competition became well entrenched
                            in 1931 and continued to increase so that by the end of 1933 its
                            participation amounted to 60.7 per cent of total imports of incandescent
                            bulbs, as compared with 17.1 percent for the United States.</p>
                        <p>This substantial increase in Japan’s share of the Cuban market for this
                            product is attributed to dumping at prices which are almost ruinous to
                            American trade. At present the Japanese are quoting a rate of $2.72 per
                            100 lamps (40 watts), c. i. f. Habana, as against an American price of
                            $12.87 per 100 lamps (40 watts), c. i. f. Habana.</p>
                        <p>This subject has been studied at considerable length by the
                            representatives of the General Electric Company, Westinghouse Company,
                            and the office of the Commercial Attaché. There is in preparation at
                            this time a complete report which will be submitted to the Department
                            within two weeks. In the meantime, Mr. Maurice McGovern, resident
                            manager of the General Electric Company, has left for Washington to
                            place the facts before the Department. His recommendations <pb n="132"
                                xml:id="pg_132" facs="0198"/>have been endorsed by the resident
                            manager of the Westinghouse Company.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the two above mentioned companies have suggested that
                            the general duty rate be increased to double the present maximum rates
                            which range from $4.00 to $24.00 per 100 lamps with a preferential to
                            the United States of 70 per cent. We suggest to the Department that the
                            general duty should be double the present maximum rates with a
                            preferential to the United States of 50 per cent. These rates are
                            essential if we are to recover our former share of the trade in
                            incandescent bulbs and allied electrical lines. Our contacts believe
                            that if we attain our former position in the sale of bulbs that we will
                            also obtain an equal percentage of the imports of other electrical
                            equipment, which has been gradually turning to the Japanese.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">4. <hi rend="italic">Lamp Cord.</hi></p>
                        <p>Of a total of $562,015 worth of insulated copper wire imported into Cuba
                            in 1929, the United States supplied over 95 per cent. By 1932 the share
                            of the United States had declined to 59 per cent. Lamp cord represents
                            one of the principal types of insulated copper wire sold in Cuba. While
                            no statistics are yet available, inquiries among the trade have
                            disclosed that in 1933, Japanese exporters obtained a large share of
                            this business through underquoting all other suppliers.</p>
                        <p>For example, American lamp cord (size 181/32) is quoted at $6,835 per
                            1,000 feet c. i. f. Habana against a Japanese price of $4.50 per 1,000
                            feet c. i. f. Habana. A general duty of $16.00 per 100 kilograms on Item
                            64–B, under which lamp cord is classified, is deemed absolutely
                            essential to protect this trade against further diminution.</p>

                        <p>In 1932, the consumption of cellophane in Cuba approximated 20,000
                            kilograms, of which the United States supplied about 15,000 kilograms
                            and Japan 352 kilograms. In 1933, the consumption increased to 40,000
                            kilograms, of which 33,000 kilograms were imported from the United
                            States and 4,616 kilograms from Japan.</p>
                        <p>The advance in imports of cellophane from Japan of 4,264 kilograms in one
                            year indicates that Japan is making a strong bid for this trade. Recent
                            reports show that Japan has further increased her participation during
                            the first quarter of 1934.</p>
                        <p>At present Japan is quoting at from $11.00 to $12.00 per ream c. i. f.
                            Habana, against the lowest American price of $15.67 per ream c. i. f.
                            Habana. Importers state that the trade is being diverted to Japan and
                            that unless the general import duty is increased Japan will dominate the
                            trade within a short time.</p>

                        <p>Agents for American manufacturers of cellophane urge that the general
                            duty be increased to 40 cents per kilogram as compared with the present
                            general duty of 10 cents. We feel that our present participation can be
                            maintained by increasing the general duty to 28 cents per kilogram on
                            sheets and 35 cents per kilogram on bags. The higher duty on the bags,
                            pouches, et cetera, is suggested in order to provide protection for the
                            local manufacturers of bags.</p>

                        <p>Although Japanese competition is of paramount interest, we should not
                            overlook the strong competition from Belgium in iron and steel products.
                            The tonnage and value of the trade are very important. So as to enable
                            our manufacturers of these products to be in a more competitive position
                            with Belgium we are suggesting these additional exceptions to the
                            principle of not increasing general duties.</p>
                        <p>In 1929, of a total trade of $1,637,895 in bars, plates and shapes, the
                            United States supplied about 30 per cent, while Belgium supplied 58 per
                            cent. Based on imports through Habana for 1933, the share of the United
                            States has declined to 10 per cent while the remainder was supplied
                            almost entirely by Belgium. Belgian exporters are quoting a base price
                            of $1.40 per 100 pounds c. i. f. Habana against an average price of
                            $1.85 from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The attention of the Department is again invited to the fact that in
                            connection with the agreement for the distribution of the international
                            sales of rails and pipes, the continental and British steel producers
                            recognized in principle that the Cuban market should be supplied by the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The following changes are recommended as being necessary to effect a
                            restoration of our former share of this very important branch of trade:

                        <p>In view of the foregoing instances of actual competition from Japan and
                            Belgium, and in view of the threatened competition as evidenced by the
                            following enclosures and information supplied by the trade, we feel that
                            it is imperative to adhere to the principle of maintaining the value of
                            the preferential. We refer again to the arguments advanced on pages 4,
                            5, and 6 of our memorandum of April 11, 1934, concerning general
                            provisions in the treaty with respect to the value of the
                            preferential.</p>
                        <p>The attention of the Department is invited to pages 25 and 26 of the
                            publication of the United States Tariff Commission (1929) entitled
                            “Effect[s] of the Cuban Reciprocity Treaty”, which reads in part as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“An appraisal leads to the conclusion that the concessions
                                    granted by Cuba have exerted an influence upon trade which, even
                                    in the years immediately following the treaty, accounted for but
                                    a minor part of the expansion of United States exports to that
                                    island, and which at present (1929) is not the determining
                                    factor in any considerable percentage of the total trade.</p>
                                <p>“On the whole it appears that the guiding principles of the
                                    recent revision of Cuba’s tariff have been such as to reduce
                                    rather than to increase the value of the preference to the
                                    United States.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>In large measure, the failure of the old treaty to benefit American trade
                            may be attributed to the incorporation of the relative preferential plan
                            without bound rates of duty. It is sincerely hoped that the same mistake
                            will not be committed in these negotiations because of theoretical
                            objections to the absolute preferential plan.</p>

                            general instructions governing the revision of the Reciprocity Treaty
                            with Cuba (instruction No. 60 of April 3, 1934), in so far as they apply
                            to the binding of rates. Point No. 12 of this instruction suggests in
                            part that “the rates of duty on important specified American products be
                            bound as to maxima by the agreement. It is suggested that rates might be
                            bound on all such important articles except those with respect to which
                            such limitation would clearly be of greater benefit to some foreign
                            country than to the United States.”</p>
                        <p>The Department has examined all the proposed schedules transmitted by the
                            Embassy with the above instructions in mind. In all cases where bound
                            rates appeared advisable, it has so stated in its instructions.
                            According to Mr. Nufer, Commercial Attaché at Habana, <pb n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135" facs="0201"/>the American technical advisers,
                            however, proceeded on the assumption that in the case of all tariff
                            items concerning which the United States was asking for change in
                            preference, in rate or in both preference and rate, the resulting United
                            States rates were to be bound. Since it is the Department’s intention
                            that the United States rates only in specified items are to be bound,
                            you are requested to reexamine the schedules submitted, in conjunction
                            with the Department’s comments thereon. The Department will, of course,
                            be pleased to give consideration to any suggestions for the binding of
                            rates not specified in its instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Department would also like to take this opportunity to clarify
                            another point that has arisen with regard to the binding of rates.
                            Apparently the American technical advisers are under the impression that
                            the agreement arrived at with Cuba will bind in each case the “absolute”
                            preference as to minimum, that is to say, that the “dollar spread”
                            between the general rate and the United States rate reached in the new
                            agreement should not be decreased during the life of the agreement. The
                            Department does not believe it advisable to request of Cuba the binding
                            of the “absolute” preference since it is not in a position to make a
                            similar concession to Cuba, which would probably be expected in a
                            reciprocal agreement. The Department believes that only the minimum
                            percentage preference should be determined, which would leave the
                            Government free to raise and lower rates (except where those rates have
                            been expressly bound as to maxima).</p>

                            revision of the reciprocity treaty will be a stimulant to economic
                            recovery, both here and in Cuba, I am desirous that the negotiations be
                            concluded at as early a date as possible. Considerable delay has
                            resulted, however, from the procedure set forth in the general
                            instructions whereby the Embassy is required to submit to the Department
                            “all proposals, including counterproposals, regarding the concessions
                            desired by the United States”. In order to expedite the revision of the
                            treaty, therefore, you may carry on your negotiations with the Cubans on
                            the basis of the schedules as submitted to and revised by the
                            Department, without referring the counter-proposals made in the course
                            of negotiations to the Department for approval, except cases involving
                            controversial concessions (such as hog lard), increases in general
                            rates, new or reclassifications, and matters of policy of interest to
                            this and other Departments.</p>

                        <p>The Department has drafted its instructions regarding the proposed
                            schedules with the idea of giving you in the case of each tariff item
                            the United States rate of duty and the preference which it hopes will be
                            arrived at. While you should endeavor to secure the agreement of the
                            Cuban authorities to the proposals as approved by the Department, I
                            realize, of course, that it will not be possible to secure in all cases
                            the exact rates and preferences desired, and therefore authorize you, in
                            your discretion, to propose and accept minor variations. Please
                            continue, however, to keep the Department currently and fully informed

                        <p>I assume that the Cuban authorities have been impressed with the fact
                            that whatever agreements you may reach with them are subject to the

                        <p>When Mr. Nufer was in Washington the question arose as to the form of the
                            revised reciprocity treaty with Cuba. It was suggested that it might be
                            preferable to limit the treaty primarily to changes in duty preferences
                            and to the binding of maximum rates on specified articles, and for the
                            Cuban Government to put into effect, prior to the date of the treaty, a
                            decree-law which would make all the agreed-upon changes in duty rates,
                            classifications and nomenclature.</p>
                        <p>This decree-law would represent a revision of the present Cuban Customs
                            Tariff, and the tariff as thus revised would be the one on which the
                            treaty would be based. Obviously, this decree-law, or tariff revision,
                            would provide no changes in the present duty preferentials, which would
                            be covered by the revised treaty.</p>
                        <p>The alternative to this would be to embody in the treaty itself all the
                            changes in duty rates, nomenclature and classification agreed upon in
                            the course of our discussions with the Cuban delegates.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion in Washington it was suggested to Mr. Nufer that we
                            approach the Cuban delegates informally in this matter in order to
                            ascertain what would be their attitude toward these two methods. The
                            Cuban delegates, speaking informally and unofficially at <pb n="137"
                                xml:id="pg_137" facs="0203"/>a conference held on April 30, were
                            unanimously in favor of what may be termed the “Decree-Law” form.</p>
                        <p>If it is agreed to adopt this form, the treaty would include, as already
                            mentioned, the percentages of duty preference to be accorded to each
                            item, and a list of items on which the rate of duty specified is to be
                            the maximum rate of duty during the life of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>In our conference with the Cuban delegates we also brought up the subject
                            of binding certain classifications, especially in those instances where
                            changes had been made (which changes would, of course, be incorporated
                            in the Decree-Law) in order to eliminate or prevent future
                            misclassifications. After discussing this at length it was informally
                            and tentatively agreed that the treaty might include a provision to the
                            effect that while the high contracting parties retain complete liberty
                            to alter classifications in the future, no percentage of preferential
                            may be decreased, and, in cases where the rate of duty is specified as a
                            maximum, such rates may not be increased as a result of any future
                            re-classification.</p>
                        <p>The merits of the Decree-Law form are as follows: <list>

                        <p>In our recent discussions with the Cuban delegates they have reiterated
                            their reluctance to reduce general rates of duty, and have repeatedly
                            expressed their preference for accomplishing reductions in rates of duty
                            to the United States by means of higher preferentials. Their reluctance
                            is due to the following points: <list>

                                <item>They claim that changes in the tariff structure will result in
                                    delaying negotiations, as in every case where a change in the
                                    general duty rate is proposed a special investigation as to the
                                    possible result of such a change will have to be made.</item>

                                <item>They have expressed the apprehension that our requests for
                                    reductions in general duty rates, in lieu of sharp increases in
                                    our preference, may indicate a general policy of our government
                                    to reduce general rates of duty on Cuban products, and to grant
                                    only slightly increased preferences, rather than to improve
                                    Cuba’s competitive position as against other foreign suppliers
                                    through high preferences. They apparently fear that their
                                    compliance with our requests might be construed as an acceptance
                                    of such a policy. (This latter argument is undoubtedly the
                                    outstanding one in the minds of the Cuban group.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The Cuban group, however, has gone so far as to admit that the granting
                            of a large number of high preferences to us might cause adverse comment,
                            and hence it is possible that we may be able to convince them of the
                            desirability of reducing general duty rates in exceptional cases.</p>
                        <p>In those cases, however, where the Cuban delegates insist on maintaining
                            their present position, could we not be authorized to accept the

                            requesting that they be authorized to accept increased preferences in
                            those cases where the Cuban authorities are disinclined to reduce
                            general rates, and to your telegram No. 298 of May 18<note n="38"
                                xml:id="d122fn3">Not printed.</note> on the same subject, the
                            Department desires to offer the following comments:</p>
                        <p>1. The trade in each tariff item has been considered individually, and in
                            each case the Department has suggested, after consideration of all
                            factors involved, the treatment best calculated to bring about the
                            desired expansion of trade between the United States and Cuba. In the
                            greater number of cases increased preferences have been suggested, and
                            in only a comparatively few cases decreased general rates. As a general
                            rule the Department has been disinclined to accept increased preferences
                            in cases where the United States enjoys a strong trade position. In such
                            cases, and where the existing duties appear to be excessive, the best
                            approach would seem to lie in decreased general rates.</p>
                        <p>2. There is attached hereto a copy of the reciprocal trade bill as
                            amended by the Senate Committee on Finance.<note n="38" xml:id="d122fn4"

                                facs="0205"/>directed to Subsection (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of
                            Section 350, as amended, reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Nothing in this section shall be
                                    construed to prevent the application, with respect to rates of
                                    duty established under this section pursuant to agreements with
                                    countries other than Cuba, of the provisions of the treaty of
                                    commercial reciprocity concluded between the United States and
                                    the Republic of Cuba on December 11, 1902, or to preclude giving
                                    effect to an exclusive agreement with Cuba concluded under this
                                    section, modifying the existing preferential customs treatment
                                    of any article the growth, produce, or manufacture of Cuba:
                                    Provided, That the duties payable on such an article shall in no
                                    case be increased or decreased by more than 50 per centum of the
                                    duties now payable thereon.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This amendment was carefully drafted in order that Cuban
                            products entering the United States might be favored by decreased rates
                            of duty, by increased preferences or by a combination of both. The form
                            of the requested concessions is, of course, for the Cuban authorities
                            themselves to determine. On its part, the Department will examine each
                            request with the criteria previously mentioned in mind. You may find it
                            desirable to call the above quoted provision to the attention of the
                            Cuban authorities, making it clear to them, however, that the bill has
                            not yet received Congressional approval. Once the Cuban authorities
                            understand the Department’s approach, they may be more inclined to grant
                            the reduced general rates requested.</p>
                        <p>As stated in the Department’s telegram of today’s date,<note n="40"
                                xml:id="d122fn5">Not printed.</note> the wisest course of procedure
                            would seem to lie in maintaining our original proposals unchanged, at
                            least until we have ascertained the Cuban reaction to all our requests.
                            If the Cuban authorities remain inflexible in their decision not to
                            grant reduced general rates in certain instances, we shall then have to
                            reconsider our position and make the necessary adjustments.</p>

                        <p>The policy of this Government is to bring about a reduction in trade
                            barriers which will result in an increase in the volume of international
                            trade. This policy, which was enunciated by this Government both at the

                            an effort to increase international trade, not merely to divert it from
                            one channel to another. The Department cannot, therefore, consistently
                            with this policy, authorize the inclusion in the agreement with Cuba of
                            any provision under which Cuba would be bound to maintain rates of duty
                            on imports from third countries which are higher than the rates now in
                            effect. The most that can be done is to authorize that certain rates in
                            excess of those now applicable be bound as to maxima, and that the
                            percentual margins of preference be increased. If, as is contemplated,
                            the general rates thus derived are embodied in the Cuban tariff law, the
                            immediate effect will be an increase in the present general rates and an
                            increase in the absolute margin of preference, in consequence of which
                            the competitive position of American producers would be materially
                            improved at least for a time. There would, however, be no obligation on
                            the part of Cuba to maintain these increased rates. Cuba would be free
                            at any time to reduce them in consequence of negotiations with third
                            countries, or autonomously.</p>

                        <p>Such a compromise between the important general policy above set forth
                            and the exigencies of the situation now facing certain of our producers
                            with respect to competition in the Cuban market, seems to the Department
                            to meet the necessities of the situation. On the one hand it is likely
                            to result in the strengthening of the competitive position of American
                            producers at a time when unsettled currency conditions and other
                            abnormal trade conditions are resulting in a loss of trade to their
                            foreign competitors. On the other hand, these measures are not such as
                            to expose this Government to the charge that it disregards in practice
                            the principles to which it professes to adhere. There is nothing in the
                            proposals herein authorized which would estop this Government from
                            objecting to provisions which have been included in agreements between
                            certain foreign governments whereby rates of duty on imports from the
                            United States and other third countries cannot be reduced by
                            negotiations or otherwise as long as those agreements remain in
                            force.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, you are authorized to propose the binding as to maxima of
                            certain increased rates on importations from the United States and to

                            with Cuba affords, I believe, significant opportunity for giving
                            practical effect to the policy of this Government towards the nations of
                            this hemisphere. The keystone of this policy must be the development of
                            mutually helpful political understanding and of mutually profitable
                            commercial relationships.</p>
                        <p>In the case of Cuba the recent signature of the new treaty of
                                relations,<note n="49" xml:id="d127fn1">Signed at Washington, May
                                29, 1934; for text, see <ref target="#pg_183">p. 183</ref>.</note>
                            eliminating the permissive right of intervention by this Government, has
                            removed a chronic source of friction between our two countries, and has
                            placed our political relations on a basis of true and friendly equality.
                            The trade agreement should, by removing barriers to commerce between the
                            two countries, prove a powerful stimulus to Cuban economic
                            rehabilitation, and at the same time, by increasing Cuba’s purchasing
                            power, open new markets for American farm and factory products.</p>
                        <p>The Cuban agreement will, moreover, be the first to be signed under the
                            tariff bargaining authority conferred upon the President by the last
                            session of Congress. This first trade agreement makes it clear that in
                            order to expand American export trade greater trade opportunities must
                            be afforded foreign products in this market.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the concessions requested by the Cuban Government (your
                            despatches Nos. 222, 540, 567 [<hi rend="italic">561</hi>], 669, 746,
                            855 [<hi rend="italic">858</hi>] and 888, of April 7, May 29, June 2, 16
                            and 27 and July 10 [<hi rend="italic">11</hi>] and 17, 1934,
                                respectively<note n="50" xml:id="d127fn2">None printed.</note>)
                            detailed and painstaking attention has been given to each. The full
                            measure of the desired trade advantages has been accorded wherever these
                            advantages do not involve unwarranted conflicts with American interests
                            or impair our bargaining position with respect to third countries. In
                            many instances the concessions requested by Cuba have been scaled down.
                            In all cases, however, the fullest consideration has been given the
                            Cuban requests. There would consequently appear to be no reason for any
                            further study of these requests by this Government.</p>
                        <p>I. The attached list covers the concessions this Government is prepared
                            to make (Enclosure l).<note n="51" xml:id="d127fn3">Not printed.</note>
                            The concessions indicated are maximum concessions; prohibitions of the
                            tariff bargaining law or reasons of policy make it impossible to
                            increase them.</p>
                        <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0210"/>
                        <p>With regard to the concessions requested, whether granted or not, there
                            is enclosed herewith a series of background memoranda (Enclosure
                                2).<note n="52" xml:id="d127fn4">Not printed.</note> In those cases
                            where no concessions have been granted, these memoranda should prove
                            helpful in explaining the reasons for our inability to accede to the
                            requests made.</p>
                        <p>II. It will be observed that in many cases separate classifications have
                            been established. The exact wording of these new classifications and of
                            other Notes to be inserted in the schedule of Cuban products accorded
                            concessions will be forwarded at an early date.</p>
                        <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Sugar</hi>. It is proposed to reduce the duty on
                            imported Cuban sugar (96 degrees) to 90 cents per hundred pounds, and to
                            make proportionate reductions in the other degrees of sugar entering
                            under paragraph 501 of the Tariff Act of 1930.<note n="53"
                                xml:id="d127fn5">46 Stat. 590.</note> The magnitude of this
                            concession is a further indication of the desire of this Government to
                            assist the Cuban people in regaining an adequate and satisfactory
                            standard of living. In view of the predominance of sugar in Cuban
                            economy, the effects of this concession should be felt throughout the
                            Island, in its industrial as well as its agricultural life.</p>
                        <p>It is to be expected that the Cuban Government, in return for this
                            concession so vital to its national livelihood, will agree to
                            concessions which will prove equivalent to those now being proposed by
                            this Government. Owing to the drastic decline of Cuban imports of
                            American products, it is essential that effective concessions be
                            obtained for our key export commodities in exchange for our concessions
                            to Cuba. I have no doubt that the Cuban Government appreciates this
                            point of view and will create the desired trade advantages for our
                            goods. Of our exports to Cuba, agricultural commodities have suffered
                            the heaviest declines. If the sugar concession above indicated is to be
                            made effective, it is imperative that greater reductions in rates than
                            those to which the Cuban authorities have agreed to grant up to the
                            present be secured on certain commodities. An air mail instruction will
                            go forward immediately on these points,<note n="52" xml:id="d127fn6">Not
                                printed.</note> which instruction does not preclude, of course, the
                            securing of the concessions considered desirable for American industrial
                            products.</p>
                        <p>It will be necessary to include a Note in the schedule of concessions to
                            Cuba along the lines of the statement appearing under sugar in the list
                            of concessions (See Enclosure 1); namely, that upon the termination of
                            the Costigan–Jones sugar legislation and in the absence of any similar
                            legislation providing for quotas, the duties on all products classified
                            under paragraphs 501 and 502 shall automatically be restored to the
                            rates then prevailing less the preference of twenty percent.</p>
                        <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>On account of certain unforeseen difficulties that have arisen concerning
                            the extent and nature of the concession on the sugars classified under
                            paragraph 502 of the Tariff Act of 1930, it will be necessary to forward
                            a supplementary instruction about this matter.</p>
                        <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Tobacco</hi>. Owing to the domestic
                            production-control program it will be necessary to establish a quota for
                            Cuban cigar leaf tobacco, if concessions in rate are to be made. The
                            attached memorandum (Enclosure 3)<note n="54" xml:id="d127fn7">Not
                                printed.</note> explains the reason necessitating this action, and
                            also describes the basis upon which it is proposed the quota be
                            established. You should strongly impress upon the Cuban authorities the
                            difficulties the domestic producers of tobacco are now encountering and
                            that only upon the basis of the proposed quota is this Government in a
                            position to make any concession on rates for cigar leaf tobacco.</p>
                        <p>At an appropriate place in the schedule of Cuban products entering the
                            United States a Note will be inserted setting forth the procedure to be
                            followed in establishing the cigar tobacco quota, which will be along
                            the lines of the statement included under tobacco and tobacco products
                            in the list of concessions. (See Enclosure 1.)</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that this statement provides that if and when the
                            cigar tobacco adjustment program is, in the opinion of the Secretary of
                            Agriculture, abandoned or substantially abandoned, the duties on all
                            forms of Cuban cigar tobacco shall automatically be restored to the
                            rates then prevailing, less the preference of twenty percent. If there
                            is strong opposition by the Cuban authorities to this latter provision,
                            the Department of Agriculture has indicated its readiness to insert in
                            the Note a provision to the effect that this Government agrees to reopen
                            for discussion with the Cuban Government the matter of rates. This
                            latter proposal should be held in reserve, and presented only if it is
                            impossible to overcome the objection of the Cuban delegates.</p>
                        <p>V. <hi rend="italic">Avocados</hi>. As I have repeatedly stated, this
                            Government is opposed to the creation of any new barriers to
                            international trade. The tariff bargaining law provides that there shall
                            be no transferring of articles between the dutiable and free lists.
                            Consistent with the declared policy of this Government, therefore, I
                            desire that the general provisions of the tariff agreement include as a
                            first article a restatement of Article I of the Reciprocity Convention
                            of 1902 regarding the free list.</p>
                        <p>At the same time the Embassy is aware of the objections by the avocado
                            producers to the free entry of avocados from Cuba, and of the pressure
                            brought to secure an amendment to Article I of the Reciprocity
                            Convention of 1902 which would exclude avocados from <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0212"/>its application. For reasons of policy
                            I believe it important to afford some measure of relief to the avocado
                            producers in this country. Inasmuch as it is proposed to handle the
                            question of perishable fruits and vegetables by means of seasonal
                            tariffs, which will permit the Cuban producers to have unlimited access
                            to this market during the period of least American production, and which
                            will at the same time protect the domestic producers during the months
                            of their greatest production, I believe that some similar arrangement in
                            connection with avocados should be agreed upon. You are requested,
                            therefore, to ask the concurrence of the Cuban Government to the
                            restriction of the exportation of avocados to the United States during
                            the months January to May, and October to December, inclusive, of each
                            year. Under this arrangement Cuban avocados during the months of June to
                            September, inclusive, will have unlimited entry.</p>
                        <p>Since we are requesting Cuba voluntarily to confine shipments to certain
                            months, and in order not to introduce any limitations into the body of
                            the trade agreement regarding Article I, this understanding should be
                            embodied in an exchange of notes. The enforcement of the restriction
                            will, of course, rest entirely with the Cuban Government. At the same
                            time should the understanding not be rigidly enforced, this Government
                            would be obliged to give consideration to action under authority
                            conferred by existing legislation.</p>
                        <p>The proposed text of the exchange of notes will be forwarded at the
                            earliest opportunity.</p>
                        <p>V [<hi rend="italic">VI?</hi>]. <hi rend="italic">Manganese</hi>.
                            Inasmuch as it is proposed that Article I of the Convention of 1902 be
                            restated as Article I of the proposed trade agreement, manganese
                            imported from Cuba will continue to enjoy free entry. However, you
                            should appropriately and explicitly point out to the Cuban authorities
                            that Cuba is not the chief source of supply for manganese imported into
                            this country, and that the United States may at some future time
                            negotiate a trade agreement with some third country, reducing the duty
                            on manganese. Under the tariff bargaining law a reduction in duty of up
                            to fifty percent is permissible. There is enclosed herewith a copy of a
                            memorandum regarding manganese (Enclosure 4).<note n="55"

                                by maintaining as the basis for their commercial relations the

                            enclosing a memorandum from the American technical advisers concerning
                            the form of the proposed trade agreement with Cuba.<note n="57"

                                    >p. 136</ref>.</note> This memorandum suggests that the new
                            trade agreement be limited primarily to changes in percentages of
                            preference and to the binding of maximum United States rates on
                            specified articles, which would be made possible if the Cuban
                            Government, immediately prior to the signature of the new agreement,
                            should put into effect by Executive decree changes agreed upon in tariff
                            numeral, nomenclature and United States rates of duty.</p>
                        <p>Since the trade agreement is to be the basic instrument governing the
                            commercial intercourse between the two countries, I believe that the
                            annexed schedules, a draft of the form of which is attached hereto,<note

                            large part of beans, and principally of red and pink beans.
                            Reconsideration has been given to this matter, with the result that you
                            are requested to recede for item 257–B to a preference of twenty-five

                        <p>The economy of Cuba being based primarily on agriculture, the concessions
                            which the United States is prepared to make to Cuba are largely to
                            agricultural products.</p>
                        <p>The outstanding concession and of vital importance at this time to the
                            rehabilitation of Cuba’s livelihood is regarding sugar, where it is
                            proposed to reduce the rate on Cuban raw sugar (96 degrees) to
                            ninetenths of a cent per pound, with a preference of twenty percent.</p>
                        <p>For tobacco, second in importance in Cuban production, it is proposed to
                            reduce the rates on all tobacco products of interest to Cuba, and to
                            subject Cuban tobacco imports to a quota of eighteen percent of the
                            total quantity of tobacco used in the United States in the manufacture
                            of cigars. This proposal is very favorable to Cuba, inasmuch as domestic
                            production has been curtailed to a far greater extent than the decline
                            in imports of Cuban tobacco, and furthermore represents a percentage of
                            participation higher than that enjoyed by Cuba during either of the last
                            two years.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed to make seasonal concessions for Cuban fresh fruits and
                            vegetables. These concessions should prove of assistance to the Cuban
                            program for crop diversification. Cuba produces many fruits and
                            vegetables that mature earlier in the winter than the similar products
                                <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0222"/>produced in the United
                            States, but has not been able to ship them to the United States in large
                            quantities because of the tariffs. Under the arrangement proposed, the
                            present rates of duty will be lowered during the months of Cuban
                            production. On this basis concessions are proposed for Cuban grapefruit,
                            lima beans, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, okra, peppers and
                            squash. In addition to these seasonal rate reductions, year round
                            reductions are proposed for pineapples and limes.</p>

                            sets forth the complete list of maximum concessions which the United
                            States is prepared to make with the exception of those concerning sugar
                            products classified under Paragraph 502 of the Tariff Act of 1930.</p>

                            997 of July 31<note n="63" xml:id="d136fn63">Despatch not
                                printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>Second paragraph, Article II, and second paragraph, Article III. The
                            exception should refer to Articles IX and XI. The purpose of the
                            phraseology “in excess of those imposed or required to be imposed” in
                            Article IX is to leave the way open, if necessary, for application of
                            laws relating to anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, et
                            cetera.</p>
                        <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0225"/>
                        <p>With reference to the suggestion to include existing and unchanged
                            percentages of preference in excess of 20 percent in the basket clause
                            of Article II, the Department would like to see each article in this
                            category fully enumerated and described in Schedule I. The desirability
                            of signing the Agreement at the earliest possible date may preclude the
                            full description in Schedule I of every article with a preference of
                            more than 20 percent. If it is impossible for the Embassy to send up the
                            Schedule piecemeal, but in numerical order, then you may follow the
                            procedure suggested in the memorandum from the American Technical
                            Advisers and substitute the following for the third paragraph of Article
                            II: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Every article the growth, produce or manufacture of the United
                                    States of America which is not provided for in Article I, and
                                    which is not enumerated and described in Schedule I annexed to
                                    this Agreement, shall, on importation into the Republic of Cuba,
                                    be granted an exclusive and preferential reduction in duty not
                                    less than the percentage of reduction which would have been
                                    accorded if imported into Cuba on the day of the signature of
                                    this Agreement, such percentage of reduction being applied to
                                    the lowest rate of duty now or hereafter payable on the like
                                    article the growth, produce or manufacture of any other foreign

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Articles V and VI. In view of the preference of the Cuban authorities to
                            include unilateral commitments in the Schedules, it is agreeable to
                            incorporate Articles V and VI in the appropriate place in Schedule I. In
                            the case of each paragraph the words “the Republic of Cuba undertakes
                            that” should be omitted.</p>
                        <p>Article VII. The first sentence should read, “Fees, charges or exactions
                            imposed by the United States of America or the Republic of Cuba for
                            consular certification of invoices and for other consular services
                            pertaining to the documentation of any shipment of articles the growth,”
                            et cetera.</p>
                        <p>Article IX. After the word “origin” in the seventh line change the colon
                            to a period. In the same line delete the words “Provided, that” and
                            begin a new paragraph reading “All articles enumerated and described”,
                            et cetera.</p>
                        <p>In the eleventh and twelfth, and eighteenth and nineteenth lines delete
                            the phrase “, other than customs duties,”.</p>
                        <p>The last sentence should start a new paragraph.</p>
                        <p>Sixth line, Article X. The word “terms” should be changed to
                            “provisions”.</p>
                        <p>Article XI. After the word “entry” at the end of the fifteenth line,
                            change the period to semicolon, and insert the following: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">

                                    or manufacture of any other foreign country.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Article XV. Place a period after the word “them” in fifth line, and for
                            what follows substitute this sentence: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Such laws, regulations, and decisions of the United States of

                                    specifically provided in statutes of the United States of
                                    America relating to articles imported into Puerto Rico.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Article XVIII. The second sentence of this article should read “Unless at
                            least six months before the expiration of the aforesaid term of three
                            years”, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the final question raised by despatch 997, it is
                            believed that the system at present used in the Cuban customs tariff may
                            be followed in preparing Schedule I; that is, that at the end of the
                            nomenclature the unit of measure will be mentioned and that in the case
                            of tare allowance, simply the word “tare” will appear in the schedule,
                            without further reference to the kind of tare.</p>

                        <p>We have the honor to report the oral statement of Mr. Angel Solano, State
                            Department member of the Cuban Delegation, that the Cuban Cabinet has
                            approved without change the preamble, Articles I, II, III, IV, VIII, X,
                            XIII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII, and XVIII of the draft of general provisions
                            as proposed by the Department. There is herewith enclosed a single copy
                            each of these Articles,<note n="65" xml:id="d138fn65">Not
                                printed.</note> the Spanish versions of which have been examined
                            carefully by Mr. Albert F. Nufer and Mr. Walter J. Donnelly and have
                            been found correct. Owing to very inadequate stenographic facilities it
                            is impossible to forward these copies in duplicate as required by the

                        <p>The unofficial opinion was expressed that Articles V and VI with
                            reference to the treatment to be accorded to canned vegetables, fish,
                            petroleum products, and lard and allied fats and oils might more
                            properly be incorporated as notes in Schedule I.</p>
                        <p>The following articles are still receiving the earnest consideration of
                            the Cuban Cabinet: <list>
                                <item>Article VII—Reduction of consular invoice fee.</item>
                                <item>Article IX—Limitation upon internal taxation.</item>

                            Articles will be presented toward the end of this week. Further

                            to restoration of prevailing rates if adjustment program abandoned. They
                            believe that since we are binding the maximum rates with much higher
                            preferences in the greater part of their tariff they are entitled to
                            guarantee of maintenance of the sugar and tobacco rates throughout the
                            life of the agreement. As they have been told this is not possible they
                            offer alternatively the following proviso at the end of the first
                            sentence of article 18 of the general provisions “or unless the rates of
                            duty on sugar and tobacco pledged in schedule II shall be increased as a
                            result of the termination or modification of the respective acts for the
                            restriction of the production of these commodities in the United States
                            in which case this agreement shall automatically expire.”</p>

                            >8</hi>] p.m. Cuban Government accepts all articles of general
                            provisions as amended by above telegram except following: old article 5
                            (secretaries still studying petroleum note); new article 5 (they desire
                            to except edible fats and oils and cigarettes from the prohibition
                            against quotas but it is my impression that they may yield on fats and
                            oils); old article 7 (they desire to begin “on or after July 1, 1935,”
                            however I feel immediate reduction of fee advisable and obtainable).</p>
                        <p>In schedule 2 Cubans asked for 75 cent rate on sugar (merely as a gesture
                            I assume). They urge a 1.2 rate on tomatoes and 2 dollars on rum.

                        <p>135. Your telegram 380, August 10, noon. Under no condition will the
                            exception of edible fats and oils from the prohibition against quotas be
                            acceptable to this Government.</p>
                        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0229"/>
                        <p>As regards the exception of cigarettes from the same prohibition, the
                            Department hopes that you will be able to persuade the Cuban authorities
                            that such exception is unnecessary. There would appear to be no real
                            ground for a belief that the Cuban market for cigarettes will be
                            over-run with the American product if the Cuban delegates agree to the
                            $3.00 United States rate suggested. Our proposal will operate to divert
                            an illicit trade to legal channels, since it is a wellknown fact that
                            American cigarettes may now be secured in Cuba at a price of around 25
                            cents a package. As stated in previous instructions, the Department is
                            prepared to accept a somewhat higher rate if necessary to reach a final
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>If the Cuban authorities insist upon some quantitative restriction, you
                            should reach an understanding to the effect that any quota that may be
                            imposed will be on a reasonable basis inasmuch as it is realized that no
                            figures for actual consumption of American cigarettes are
                            obtainable.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the Cuban counter-proposals mentioned in paragraph 2 of
                            your telegram, the concessions which we proposed were not for bargaining
                            purposes, since they represent the maximum to which this Government can
                            agree.</p>

                        <p>396. Cuban authorities now accept all articles of general provisions as
                            amended by the Department except that in new article V they propose
                            elimination of phrase “other than dutiable sugar or tobacco or dutiable
                            products thereof.” However, if we insist on retention they propose
                            transferring this phrase introduced by “such as dutiable” to the very
                            end of the article.</p>
                        <p>This change is desired to make the article appear bilateral in form. They
                            have dropped proposal to except edible fats and cigarettes from the
                            prohibition against quotas.</p>

                            imported products the product of which is restricted” means now
                            restricted or means present or future restrictions.</p>
                        <p>They now accept petroleum note and will be interested in technical

                        <p>149. Your 396, August 15. Since the last exception in the proviso of new
                            Article V is clearly intended to apply to control programs such as the
                            sugar and tobacco, you may agree to the deletion of the phrase “other
                            than dutiable sugar or tobacco or dutiable products thereof”. In order

                            Law.</p>
                        <p>We have discussed at great length with the Cuban authorities the subject
                            of the prior decree law. The preparation and scope of this decree law
                            present certain difficulties arising mainly out of the fact that Cuban
                            decrees and laws effecting tariff changes always show the new maximum
                            and general rates together with the United States preferences and rates.
                            The Cuban authorities are agreed that the <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166"
                                facs="0232"/>promulgation of tariff changes in any other form would
                            be unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>As a result of our discussions the following proposal regarding the
                            decree law is submitted to the Department for approval:</p>
                        <p>The decree law would contain all changes that have been agreed upon as a
                            result of our negotiations, excepting only those notes which refer
                            solely to agreements between Cuba and the United States. The changes
                            that would appear in the decree law would include: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Changes in the numbers and letters of tariff items.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Changes in classification and nomenclature.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>Changes in general rates.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>

                                <label>6.</label>
                                <item>All notes except those which refer solely to agreements
                                    between the two contracting countries. (These latter notes, as
                                    well as those we wish to bind, will appear in Schedule
                                    I.)</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The decree law in its final form would be submitted to the Department for
                            approval prior to the signature of the agreement. It should be
                            promulgated after the agreement is signed and should become effective
                            shortly before the effective date of the agreement.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the Department’s instruction No. 292 of July 28,
                            Schedule I of the agreement would contain: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The classification, United States preference and United States
                                    rate on all items where the rate is bound—(Columns I and
                                    II).</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The classification and United States preference only in all
                                    items where there has been a change in preference but the rate
                                    left unbound—(Column I).</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>All notes referring to agreements applying only to Cuba and to
                                    the United States and those notes the inclusion of which has
                                    been requested by the Department for the purpose of
                                    binding.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>If the above decree law method is not followed, it would be necessary,
                            under the established Cuban legislative procedure, to issue two decree
                            laws. The first would have to be issued prior to the signature of the
                            agreement and would contain the information previously listed, except
                            that the indicated preference to the United States would be that now in
                            effect and the resulting United States rates would have to be shown.
                            This would involve serious problems and would complicate and delay the
                            work. In the case of items involving consolidations of several items
                            there are several cases where as many as three preferences are involved.
                            Not only are the difficulties of drafting serious, but many of the
                            United States rates as published would appear ridiculous, and as this
                            would be the first public information on the agreement, public opinion
                            would in all probability be aroused against the agreement as a result of
                            the inevitable misinterpretations which would result and which would not
                            be dispelled until the agreement is promulgated.</p>
                        <pb n="167" xml:id="pg_167" facs="0233"/>
                        <p>Following the promulgation of the agreement a second Decree-Law would
                            have to be published incorporating the United States preferentials
                            indicated in Schedule I and the resulting United States rates. The first
                            decree would involve innumerable useless calculations and the issuing of
                            two decree laws increases the chances of error. As under the proposed
                            plan of only one decree-law, all changes appearing in Schedule I, with
                            the exception of notes referring to agreements between the two
                            contracting countries would be shown, we feel very strongly that the
                            problem will be simplified and that the plan should by all means be
                            approved by the Department.</p>
                        <p>However, the Department’s attention is invited to the possibility of this
                            proposal conflicting with the terms of the General Provisions. We have
                            in mind particularly the second sentence of Article VIII where reference
                            is made to “… in force on the day of signature of this Agreement.” If
                            the Department concurs, such conflict may be removed by changing this
                            wording to “… in force on the day this Agreement becomes effective.”</p>
                        <p>As work on the preparation of the decree law will be hindered until the
                            Department’s instructions are received, it is urgently recommended that
                            they be transmitted by cable at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

                            not necessary since they are all provided for in the agreement. This
                            will simplify the work and should enable them to have the decree law
                            printed and ready for promulgation simultaneously with the signing of
                            the agreement.</p>
                        <p>It is our understanding that the decree law should be promulgated

                            become effective immediately prior to effective date of agreement. The
                            Cubans agree with us that the decree law should become effective at
                            midnight September 1 instead of Sunday, September 2. Will the trade
                            agreement be made public immediately after the signing on Friday?</p>

                                Secretary of State</hi></p>
                        <p>At the time of the signing of the Trade Agreements Act, I stated that the
                            authority under this new act of Congress would be exercised with the
                            utmost care, fairness, and intelligence; that the primary object of the
                            Administration’s tariff policy would be to benefit every important
                            American interest; that nothing would be done blindly or recklessly;
                            that the fullest possible information would be first assembled and the
                            needs of business studied; and that the negotiations for the conclusion
                            of reciprocal trade agreements under this Act would be conducted step by
                            step in the light of the information obtained. Today, after more than
                            twelve months’ painstaking and expert study, the United States and Cuba
                            have signed a Trade Agreement calculated to restore the once flourishing
                            trade between the two countries, now reduced to a fraction of its former
                            amount. The agreement is mutually advantageous to the United States and
                            to Cuba. Recognizing that the movement of goods has been seriously
                            handicapped by the tariff barriers which each of the two countries has
                            erected, they have agreed, in this instrument, to make substantial
                            adjustments, which, with equal profit and without dislocating productive
                            forces, will facilitate the sale of more American goods in Cuba and of
                            more Cuban commodities in the United States.</p>
                        <p>In 1924, the total value of our own exports to Cuba amounted to almost
                            $200,000,000; last year, our exports to Cuba were barely onetenth of
                            that amount. We have every hope that the conclusion of this Agreement
                            today will rapidly restore to the American farmer, to the American
                            wage-earner, and to the American manufacturer, the benefits of the
                            important market in Cuba which they formerly enjoyed.</p>

                        <p>Many years before Cuba gained her Independence from Spain, her commercial
                            relations with the United States of America were already great and her
                            prosperity or poverty on many occasions depended upon the American
                            tariffs.</p>
                        <p>When Cuba, with the assistance of the United States, gained her
                            independence, the Government at Washington became aware of the fact that
                            there should exist a commercial Treaty between the two countries which
                            would guarantee preferential rates to the products of the people and
                            industry of the two nations, and this led to the negotiation of the
                            Treaty of December 11, 1902, which is still in force at the present time
                            and which has proved to be highly useful in furthering the commercial
                            relations of Cuba and the United States, although its modification has
                            for some time been considered necessary for the mutual protection of the
                            interests of both peoples.</p>
                        <p>In order that a new Treaty might be negotiated as early as possible, two
                            things were necessary: 1. A Government such as that of President
                            Roosevelt, which would appreciate the great need and convenience of such
                            negotiation, and 2. an American Congress capable of facilitating the
                            negotiation of treaties like the one which has just been signed by their
                            Excellencies Secretary of State Hull, Assistant Secretary of State
                            Welles, Ambassadors Caffery and Márquez Sterling, and by myself as
                            Secretary of State of Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I wish to honestly say that although the new Treaty is of mutual benefit
                            to the two countries, it represents a substantial help for Cuba, a
                            country which has so greatly suffered during the last few years owing to
                            the high tariffs which have been applied by the United States to the
                            products of the soil and industry of our Island.</p>
                        <p>And for that noble act, in the name of the Cuban people, and at the
                            special request of President Mendieta and of his Government, I express
                            our sincere gratitude to President Roosevelt and to the American
                            people.</p>

                        <p>With reference to the Swiss Chargé d’Affaires’s call of August 22, I
                            ascertained that the position of this Government would be that our
                            treaty relations with Cuba were on a special footing specifically
                            recognized in all our unconditional most favored nation treaties.
                            Accordingly, no third country would benefit by reductions granted to
                            Cuba.</p>
                        <p>I also ascertained that the Department of Agriculture had not yet
                            completed its regulations governing the admission of foodstuffs from
                            abroad as a result of the drought and attendant speculation.</p>
                        <p>I informed Mr. Micheli on both these questions Thursday, August 23.</p>

                            agreement which holds such great promise of immediate substantial
                            contribution to the welfare of our respective countries through
                            renaissance of trade upon a sound economic basis of natural

                            States I desire warmly to reciprocate the cordial sentiments expressed
                            in Your Excellency’s message on the occasion of the signing of the trade
                            agreement between the United States and Cuba.</p>
                        <p>This readjustment of the basis upon which the commercial relations
                            between our respective countries have rested since the Convention of
                            1902 to meet the necessities of present-day conditions has been achieved
                            in an exemplary spirit of amity and close cooperation.</p>
                        <p>It is my conviction, not only that the United States and Cuba will
                            immediately feel the beneficial effects of this agreement in increased
                            exchange of products to their mutual general advantage, but that the
                            conclusion of this agreement may serve to initiate a widespread movement
                            toward general reduction of those artificial barriers which have so
                            largely contributed to stagnation of international trade.</p>
                        <p>I am particularly happy to have been associated with Your Excellency in

                        <p>I wish to again ask for assistance in our very difficult situation in
                            consideration of your kindness and good will. Our labor problems are
                            most serious and increasing because of delay in starting the crop. As
                            sugar is our main industry we need a very substantial raw sugar quota
                            which I have anticipated to my people would probably not be less than
                            2,000,000 long tons and a reduction in the duty. These concessions
                            obtained quickly would give the mill owners incentive to pay higher
                            wages and start work. Many thanks with my expression of high regard.</p>

                        <p>Your cable, received last night, has had, of course, my most earnest
                            attention. The economic conditions unfortunately existing in Cuba are
                            well known to me and I fully appreciate the preponderant effect which
                            the situation of the Cuban sugar industry has had in creating these
                            difficulties. It is my intention to recommend immediate remedial action
                            by this Government, which, while not contributing to higher prices to
                            the American consumer of sugar, may yet at the same time increase
                            returns to our own producers and likewise contribute to the economic
                            rehabilitation of Cuba. I earnestly trust that the action proposed will
                            alleviate the distressing conditions to which you refer.</p>
                        <p>Please accept the assurances of my highest consideration.</p>

                            <p>[The records in the files of the Department of State regarding the
                                negotiation of this treaty are fragmentary. In reply to an inquiry,
                                Mr. Sumner Welles, who was Assistant Secretary of State in 1934,
                                wrote on March 1, 1948, to Mr. Robert A. Lovett, Under Secretary of
                                State, a letter containing the following statement: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“It is, however, hardly a matter of surprise to me that the
                                        Departmental files should contain little documentation with
                                        regard to the Treaty of 1934. When the President sent me to
                                        Cuba as Ambassador in the spring of 1933, it was agreed
                                        between us that one of the major objectives of my mission
                                        should be to prepare the way for the negotiation of a new
                                        treaty between Cuba and the United States by which the Platt
                                        Amendment might be abrogated. During the months I was in
                                        Cuba I discussed this objective with certain Cuban leaders,
                                        among them Dr. Cosme de la Torriente, who later became
                                        Secretary of State in the Mendieta Government and under
                                        whose direction the negotiations on the part of the Cuban
                                        Government for the Treaty of 1934 were carried on. There was
                                        no difference of opinion between the Cuban Government and
                                        ourselves at that time as to what the Treaty should contain,
                                        and there was actually very little disagreement as to the
                                        provisions to be included therein. I have a very clear
                                        recollection that Dr. Márquez Sterling, then Cuban
                                        Ambassador in Washington, and I sat down together in my
                                        office in the Department of State and agreed upon a text
                                        which later, with slight amendment, became the definitive
                                        text. I recollect further that the President approved
                                        without change the text agreed upon by the Cuban Ambassador
                                        and myself.” (711.37/3–148)]</p>

                            note that the Department will not issue a license for the export of arms
                            and munitions of war unless it has been informed by your Embassy that it
                            is the desire of the Cuban Government that a particular shipment be
                            authorized. Several manufacturers and exporters have already made
                            application for licenses in accordance with the terms of these

                        <p>Lcdo. Logroño told me that he had discussed my suggestion with the
                            President but that the latter was not inclined to take any action until
                            the return of the Secretary of State to Washington, in view of the
                            understanding stated to have been reached between Dr. Cestero, the
                            Dominican Delegate at the recent Pan-American Conference at Montevideo,
                            and Secretary Hull, to the effect that this whole matter was to be
                            deferred pending the return of the Secretary to the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the President readily admitted
                            the wholesome effect which would be produced in interested quarters by
                            strict compliance on the part of the Dominican Government with the
                            Emergency Law, including that article of the Law providing for the
                            remittance of surplus accumulated in the Emergency Fund to the General
                            Receiver for amortization of Dominican bonds. At the same time, the
                            Minister said, the President was sanguine as to the possibility of
                            reaching an agreement with the bondholders that would enable the
                            Government to use this surplus for other purposes. <pb n="190"
                                xml:id="pg_190" facs="0256"/>As the Department is aware, the purpose
                            which the President has in mind is the application of the surplus, or as
                            much of it as possible, to carrying out the public works program of the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said the President was anxious also to hold the surplus as a
                            bargaining element that might be useful in negotiating the desired debt
                            readjustment, intimating that the depletion of the surplus by making
                            further remittance for amortization would weaken the argument that the
                            Dominican Government requires these funds for other purposes because of
                            decreased revenue. I said I thought the President might be mistaken as
                            to the value of this argument in the forthcoming negotiations, the
                            course of which would probably be determined rather by thorough analysis
                            of the actual financial and fiscal condition of the Dominican Government
                            on the part of the negotiators for the bondholders than by a general
                            assertion on the part of the Government that the funds were needed, it
                            being known that they were to be used for public works. I added that
                            while the President’s wish to use the money for this purpose was
                            understandable, he should not lose sight of the express terms of the
                            Emergency Law as to disposition of these funds, nor of the obligation to
                            comply with the Law in this respect. I did not remind the Minister that
                            the Law itself was in admitted violation of solemn international
                            obligations.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out to the Minister that in view of present prices of the 1942
                            bonds, the discreet application of say, two hundred thousand dollars of
                            the year-end surplus in the Emergency Fund to the purchase of these
                            bonds would make it possible to reduce the debt substantially, so that
                            the Dominican Government would benefit not only through the saving thus
                            effected in subsequent interest payments, but through an exceptionally
                            large decrease in the nominal value of the debt outstanding. I called
                            the Minister’s attention to the fact that, meanwhile, only a relatively
                            small part of the surplus had been drawing any interest from the bank in
                            which the funds are deposited, and that consequently the funds were
                            practically idle. I added that while the purchase of bonds at present
                            market prices could hardly be said to be in the best interest of
                            bondholders who might sell at prevailing prices, it would certainly be
                            in the interest of the Dominican Government as a matter of business
                            only, quite aside from the moral effect of having it understood that the
                            Dominican Government was disposed strictly to comply with the Emergency
                            Law. The Minister was quick to see this point but repeated that the
                            President expected to take no further action in the premises until
                            Secretary Hull returns to Washington and resumes his personal
                            participation in the proposed negotiations.</p>
                        <p>In this relation, I beg leave to advise the Department that in
                            conversation some days ago with Mr. Fred Q. Rickards, Internal Revenue
                            Adviser of the Dominican Government, I learned that the unapplied <pb
                                n="191" xml:id="pg_191" facs="0257"/>surplus in the Emergency Fund
                            at the end of December, 1933, amounted to not less than $424,000. When I
                            mentioned to Mr. Rickards that I had discussed with the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs the possibility of a year-end remittance from the
                            surplus for amortization, Mr. Rickards informed me that it had been
                            “more or less understood” between the Department of State and the
                            unofficial agents of the Dominican Government during the recent
                            conversations in Washington, that no further remittances for
                            amortization would be made until the entire debt question should be
                            settled, presumably with the Central Bondholders Committee or the
                            holders of the Dominican external debt.</p>
                        <p>As, up to the present time, the Department has not advised me of the
                            existence of any such understanding, I have been guided with regard to
                            this question by the Department’s instruction No. 199 of August 25,
                                1933<note n="3" xml:id="d174fn3"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_643"

                            number), in which I was directed to bring to the attention of the
                            Dominican Government the situation arising from the accumulation of a
                            considerable surplus in the Emergency Fund, and the pertinent provision
                            of the Emergency Laws, namely, Article 6 (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)
                            thereof. It will be recalled from my telegram No. 35 of September 6,
                                1933,<note n="4" xml:id="d174fn4"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_645"

                            the enclosure to my despatch No. 1263 of November 4, 1933<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d174fn5"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_655"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Ibid.</hi>, p. 655</ref>; enclosure not printed.</note> (p.
                            19, <hi rend="italic">et seq</hi>.) that I made no formal
                            representations to the Dominican Government in pursuance of that
                            instruction for the reason that it seemed likely at that time that the
                            Dominican Government would make a remittance from the surplus for
                            amortization, as indeed was done on September 14 last, when $100,000 was
                            remitted for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of the present attitude of the Dominican Government, as
                            reported in my despatch above cited and in the present despatch; in view
                            of the fact that I am skeptical as to the accuracy of the Dominican
                            Government’s impression that further negotiations for the readjustment
                            of the external debt service are being deferred at the personal request
                            of the Secretary of State of the United States; in view of the very
                            large surplus now accumulated and unapplied in the Emergency Fund; and
                            in view of the recent indefinite extension of the Emergency Law, with
                            every probability of the steady accumulation of an increasing surplus
                            through steadily increasing customs collections from the low point in
                            1932, I believe that it would be prudent to make a point of keeping
                            clear the record of the American Government’s treatment of this matter,
                            by authorizing me to deliver to the Dominican Government a note
                            expressed substantially in the terms of the enclosed draft.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d174fn6">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0258"/>
                        <p>I would recommend that I be authorized to deliver this note to the
                            Dominican Government at the earliest date possible and preferably during
                            the current month, for the reason, among others, that until the end of
                            this month the note would have reference only to the surplus accumulated
                            in the Emergency Fund during the life of the original Emergency Law. It
                            appears desirable to make a communication to the Dominican Government in
                            the sense of the enclosed draft note (which is in pursuance of the
                            Department’s instruction No. 199 above mentioned) for the further reason
                            that my note of December 12, 1933, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            (copy of which was enclosed with my despatch No. 1343 of December
                                13),<note n="7" xml:id="d174fn7"><ref target="frus1933v05#pg_667"

                                        rend="smallcaps">v</hi>, p. 667</ref>.</note> leaves the way
                            open for the expression of the Department’s hope that the Dominican
                            Government will comply with the Emergency Law in respect of the
                            application of the surplus now accumulated in the Emergency Fund. The
                            statement made on behalf of the Department in my note of December 12,
                            with special reference to the application of the surplus, is of a
                            strictly limited nature, in that it does not, and perhaps could not at
                            that time, express the Department’s desire that the surplus should be
                            applied as stipulated in the Emergency Law. It now appears, however,
                            that the Dominican Government is under the impression that the
                            remittance of the surplus is a matter of indifference to our Government.
                            Such a misunderstanding on the part of the Dominican Government ought, I
                            think, to be cleared up by a more definite statement of the Department’s
                            wishes. The enclosed draft note may serve that purpose. If the
                            Department approves this line of thought and the terms of the proposed
                            note, I shall be glad to be so instructed by telegraph in time to
                            deliver the note as early in the current month as possible.</p>

                            1375 of January 3, 1934, we are now in position to say that the
                            Secretary advises that he was inaccurately quoted in the statement
                            attributed to him by Mr. Cestero. What he did state, was that he could
                            not discuss the matter while away from the records in Washington and
                            that on his return here he would carefully examine the <pb n="193"
                                xml:id="pg_193" facs="0259"/>memorandum handed him. You are
                            authorized to communicate this informally to the Foreign Minister and
                            also in the same manner make him understand that our attitude as
                            indicated in the letters to Mr. Davies<note n="8" xml:id="d175fn8"

                            copies of which you have received, remains unchanged, namely, that it is
                            expected and assumed that they will promptly communicate with the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council relative to the matter in
                            question. Furthermore, you can let it be understood that we will hold
                            entirely aloof from any conferences that may be had beyond supplying any
                            data from the Department’s records that may be desired.</p>
                        <p>You may also add that we are at a loss to understand why the Dominican
                            Government has failed to comply with the terms of Article 6 (<hi

                        <p>2. I spoke to the Minister of Foreign Affairs this morning in the sense
                            of the Department’s telegram No. 2, January 13, 4 p.m., and left with
                            him a memorandum of my oral statement. Minister of Foreign Affairs
                            informed me that Dominican Government would probably send to the United
                            States in the near future Undersecretary of Finance Nicolas Vega and
                            Fred Q. Rickard, internal revenue adviser, to begin negotiations with
                            the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council. The Minister indicated also
                            that the Executive power would probably remit to receiver for
                            amortization under article 6–D of the Emergency Law at least substantial
                            portion of the surplus in Emergency Fund. The Minister said he would
                            probably send me a note in the near future clarifying the position of
                            the Dominican Government in order that all concerned might be reassured
                            of the Government’s good intentions. He concluded by assuring me that
                            none of the statements made to him on behalf of the Department this
                            morning were “disagreeable” to the Dominican Government and said he
                            would lose no time in communicating the substance of my informal
                            representation to the President of the Dominican Republic who is now at
                            Santiago.</p>
                        <p>I believe the informal statements which were made to the Minister this
                            morning will have a very wholesome effect upon the Dominican <pb n="194"

                            been.</p>

                        <p>3. My telegram No. 2, January 16, noon. In response to my inquiry
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me this afternoon that Dominican
                            Government was awaiting advice from Washington as to appointment of
                            subcommittee of Foreign Bondholders Protective Council before sending
                            representatives to begin negotiations on Dominican debt problem and that
                            it was anxious to begin these negotiations as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>With reference to remittance of surplus in Emergency Fund for
                            amortization, however, Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me that the
                            President of the Dominican Republic intended to “fight this matter to
                            the last” making it clear that no remittance will be made pending the
                            result of negotiations above mentioned. This disavowal by the President
                            of the assurances of the Minister of Foreign Affairs as reported in my
                            telegram cited was foreshadowed especially in my despatch No. 1375,
                            January 3 and previous correspondence.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me also that the President had
                            disapproved his suggestion of sending me a clarifying note on the ground
                            that what is now needed on the part of the Dominican Government is
                            “Action” rather than diplomatic correspondence. He added that the
                            President and the Dominican Government had taken my oral statement and
                            memorandum of January 16 as a friendly intimation that action was
                            desired. I assured the Minister that this understanding was quite
                            correct and that it seemed to me highly desirable for the Dominican
                            Government to expedite their proposed action in respect of the
                            negotiations.</p>
                        <p>I did not, however, press the Minister further on the subject of
                            remittance from surplus for amortization. Does the Department desire me
                            to press further for this remittance? I consider it desirable to do so
                            and in more positive terms than have been employed thus far.</p>

                        <p>5. My telegram No. 3, January 25, 6 p.m. As bearing upon the Department’s
                            consideration of its policy with regard to compliance by Dominican
                            Government with article 6 (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) of Emergency Law
                            and generally in the matter of Dominican financial situation … informs
                            me today in absolute confidence that President Trujillo has from time to
                            time for some months received through Messrs. Davies or Newman,<note
                                n="9" xml:id="d178fn9">Oliver Peck Newman, Financial Adviser and
                                Special Emergency Agent for the Dominican Republic.</note> or both,
                            reports of oral but allegedly specific commitments taken in Washington
                            on behalf of our Government on this subject which were evidently at
                            variance with Department’s official instructions to me. I understand,
                            for instance, that it was reported to President Trujillo by them that
                            specific assurances had been given them on behalf of the Department last
                            fall that, provided Dominican Government should undertake negotiations
                            for general settlement of debt problem “within 6 months”, the American
                            Government would not bring up the matter of further remittances for
                            amortization pending conclusion of negotiations. I understand from …
                            also that when I made to President Trujillo last September informal
                            suggestion that remittance of $400,000 from surplus in the Emergency
                            Fund seemed appropriate at that time, the President consulted Messrs.
                            Davies and Newman who reported that the American Government would
                            consider remittance of $100,000 satisfactory. Remittance of this amount
                            only was accordingly made.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, in
                            response to my inquiry as to what news the Dominican Government had of
                            the status of the financial negotiations in the United States, the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me this morning that President
                            Trujillo had just received from Mr. Joseph E. Davies a copy of a
                            pamphlet prepared by Mr. Davies setting forth the Dominican case in
                            these negotiations.<note n="14" xml:id="d182fn14">Copy of the memorial
                                dated March 23, 1934, was transmitted to the Department by Mr.
                                Davies in a letter dated April 13, 1934; not printed
                                (839.51/4104).</note> The Minister said that the Government was much
                            impressed with the completeness of this work.</p>
                        <p>A report had also been received, signed by the Dominican Minister at
                            Washington and by Messrs. Davies and Newman, to the effect that they
                            were hopeful of a successful outcome of the negotiations, although these
                            had not been proceeding very actively in the recent past. The report,
                            according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed gratification at
                            the courteous attention which the Dominican negotiators had received
                            from Mr. J. Reuben Clark, Jr., acting president of the Foreign
                            Bondholders Protective Council, and other officials of that

                        <p>I had a conversation with the Secretary of Finance, Señor Rafael Brache,
                            on the night of June 16 in the course of which he asked me <pb n="198"
                                xml:id="pg_198" facs="0264"/>whether I had any news as to the
                            progress of the Dominican external debt negotiations in the United
                            States. When I told him that I had no recent information as to progress,
                            he mentioned that some opposition had developed on the part of some
                            bondholders, especially Mr. Frank H. Vedder, to the proposition of the
                            Dominican Government for a four year moratorium in the sinking fund
                            payments. He said he was acquainted with Mr. Vedder who had been in
                            business in this country. The Minister said that in his opinion it was
                            desirable in the interests of the bondholders themselves to place no
                            obstacle in the way of the reconstruction of the Republic and to
                            facilitate this reconstruction by President Trujillo’s administration. I
                            said to the Minister that I was confident the Bondholders Protective
                            Council would consider this aspect of the matter in a spirit of entire
                            fairness, although I would not advise the Government to count on the
                            Council’s sanctioning a complete suspension of sinking fund for four
                            years. I added that the basic question seemed to be whether such a
                            complete suspension of the sinking fund was necessary or whether, on the
                            other hand, a rate of sinking fund payments should not be agreed on
                            which would permit the development of the reconstruction program while
                            at the same time providing for regular reduction of the external funded
                            debt at a reasonable rate. The Minister thereupon said that, in his
                            personal opinion, the continuance of some sinking fund payments might be
                            beneficial to the Government in providing an element of financial
                            stability and maintaining the Government’s credit.</p>
                        <p>The Minister alluded to the recent protest of the sugar industry against
                            the proposed levy of export taxes and said that he did not believe the
                            “alarm” of the industry was justified, inasmuch as the Government had
                            merely taken “precautionary” measures in causing the Constitution to be
                            amended as it was recently by the Constituent Assembly. The Minister
                            said that President Trujillo throughout his Administration had been very
                            “fortunate” in all his measures. The Minister evidently desired me to
                            understand that while the recent protest of the sugar industry had been
                            a somewhat unpleasant surprise for the Government, the matter was not
                            deemed serious in view of the assurances given by the President to the
                            sugar companies on June 14. I said that the recent amendments to the
                            Constitution appeared to have caused considerable repercussion in the
                            business community, both here and in the United States, and that the
                            situation might be thought to illustrate the wisdom of keeping in mind
                            in matters of public policy the timeliness of any measures proposed. I
                            said it was my impression that the Government’s recent action in
                            amending the Constitution was regarded in some quarters as having the
                            aspect of a kind of pressure to facilitate the debt negotiations pending
                            in the United States. The Minister pointed out that there <pb n="199"
                                xml:id="pg_199" facs="0265"/>was no direct connection between
                            holders of Dominican bonds, many of whom were not American citizens, and
                            the business interests whose fears had been aroused by the Government’s
                            recent action in amending the Constitution. I asked the Minister whether
                            information was now available as to the number and identity of
                            individual holdings of Dominican bonds. The Minister seemed to be
                            uninformed on this point.</p>
                        <p>The Minister said he was now studying the contract recently signed by the
                            Haitian Government and the National City Bank of New York for the
                            transfer to that Government of the National Bank of Haiti.<note n="16"
                                xml:id="d183fn16">For the plan for the transfer of the National Bank
                                of Haiti, see <ref target="#pg_339">pp. 339</ref> ff.</note> He felt
                            there was a possibility that some similar arrangement might be made in
                            the Dominican Republic to set up a national bank of issue and turn over
                            certain fiscal duties and the functions of the General Receivership of
                            Dominican Customs to it, though he said, of course, it would be expected
                            that the present General Receiver, Mr. Pulliam, would continue to
                            function in that capacity under any such arrangement.</p>
                        <p>I gained the distinct impression from my conversation with the Minister
                            of Finance that the recent protest of the sugar industry against the
                            possible imposition of export taxes and the attitude of other companies
                            that may be affected by the newly instituted policy regarding
                            contractual tax exemptions, were giving the Government concern and
                            causing it at least to pause momentarily in the execution of its
                            program. Incidentally, the Minister said that some measures had been
                            suggested that he himself had undertaken to stop on the ground that they
                            would cause too much alarm in the business world. He did not indicate
                            what these measures were but, judging from rumors current here, it seems
                            possible that they have to do with the possible establishment of certain
                            Government monopolies under some of the newly amended provisions of the
                            Constitution.</p>

                        <p>The proposal as made by the Dominican Republic to the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council, Inc., was prompted by an earnest desire to preserve
                            the credit of the Dominican Republic and to preserve compliance with its
                            obligations to foreign bondholders to the utmost degree, consistent only
                            with its paramount duty to preserve the functions of government under
                            the unprecedented conditions of the worldwide depression from which my
                            government and people have suffered.</p>
                        <p>You will note that this agreement reached by the representatives of the
                            Dominican Republic and the Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, Inc.,
                            contemplates the complete restoration of conditions existing under the
                            outstanding bond contracts, and the present convention between my
                            government and the government of the United States, except only as is
                            therein provided, for the extension of the time for ultimate payment of

                            necessarily involves the complete restoration of the operation of the
                            customs receivership under the treaty with the United States;<note

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your note dated August 7, 1934, in which you advise me that
                            after full consultation and discussion with the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council, Incorporated, the Government of the Dominican
                            Republic will voluntarily make to the holders of its foreign dollar
                            bonds a proposal for the future settlement thereof which involves the
                            reestablishment of the full treaty situation under the Convention
                            between the two Governments of December 27, 1924, the payment of the
                            full interest on the outstanding bonds, the making of amortization
                            payments for the current and future years so as to provide a definite
                            plan for the complete amortization of both bond issues, and other
                            undertakings set out in the proposal.</p>
                        <p>It is with particular pleasure and approval that I have observed your
                            statement that the Government of the Dominican Republic has determined,
                            subject to the terms of the new proposal, immediately to reestablish the
                            full treaty situation, which it modified in 1931; that it will at once
                            repeal the Dominican legislation known as the Emergency Laws
                            inconsistent therewith; and that these measures will bring about the
                            immediate and complete restoration to the general receiver of customs of
                            his full treaty functions in accordance with such proposal. I also
                            observe with satisfaction that the Dominican Government will at no time
                            in the future contend that any act of forbearance heretofore done or
                            exercised by the Government of the United States in relation to the
                            convention between the two countries in connection with the foreign bond
                            control, up to and including the present, has been in fact or shall be
                            in any manner construed by your government to be a waiver by the
                            Government of the United States of any of the terms or obligations of
                            the said convention between the two governments.</p>
                        <p>I have been much gratified to receive from the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council, Incorporated, a letter<note n="20" xml:id="d185fn20"

                                1934, p. 62.</note> stating that the Council has carefully studied
                            the proposal of your Government and that it “has reached the conclusion
                            that considering all the facts and circumstances involved, the proposal
                            of the Dominican Government seems to the Council fair to the Dominican
                            Republic and its people and consistent with the broad equities and
                            long-view interests of the bondholders, being indeed, in some respects,
                            distinctly advantageous to them over their present situation”. It is
                            with especial pleasure that I <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0268"
                            />observe this favorable conclusion of the negotiations in which you
                            have engaged.</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that it should be a matter of great satisfaction and pride
                            to the Dominican people and to your Government that during this period
                            of world depression your Government has maintained prompt payment of
                            full interest on its foreign obligations, and that it now demonstrates
                            its purpose to comply with amortization requirements on bond contracts
                            by making such provision therefor as it feels it is able to make for the
                            protection of the holders of its foreign bonds. In the substantial
                            effort which the Dominican Government is thus making to meet, as far as
                            it feels able, its pledged faith on its financial obligations, the
                            Dominican Government has set an example worthy of emulation.</p>

                            September 5, 1933,<note n="21" xml:id="d186fn21">Not printed.</note> and
                            to previous correspondence from your Legation, regarding the murder in
                            the Dominican Republic of Eduardo Colom y Piris, an American
                            citizen.</p>
                        <p>It appears from the record in this case that Colom was arrested on April
                            29, 1933, while in the Duarte Park in San Pedro de Macorís, on account
                            of certain alleged remarks concerning the President of the Dominican
                            Republic, which remarks, if made, and if they could be construed as an
                            offense under the laws of the Dominican Republic, must have constituted
                            a minor offense. It further appears that, while <pb n="203"
                                xml:id="pg_203" facs="0269"/>Colom was being held in jail awaiting
                            investigation or trial he was secretly removed therefrom by Lieutenant
                            Sindulfo Benavides Minaya, an officer of the Corps of Aides to the
                            President of the Dominican Republic, and was summarily executed by such
                            officer without any pretense of legal justification therefor, except
                            alleged statements derogatory to the President. Sindulfo Benavides
                            Minaya must have been in chargé of the jail or have been assisted in
                            obtaining custody of the victim by the official who was in chargé of it.
                            In these circumstances, this Government has no other alternative than to
                            hold the Dominican Government responsible for the death of the American
                            citizen in question. This fact is not modified, in any way, by the
                            circumstance of the killing of Minaya during an alleged attempt to
                            escape while under arrest awaiting trial for the murder of Colom.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, special reference is made to the decisions of the

                        <p>In the Quintanilla case, a Mexican citizen had been taken into custody by
                            an American deputy sheriff and later found murdered. Although there was
                            no evidence to indicate that the murder had been committed by the deputy
                            sheriff, the Commission held that: <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>The circumstances in the Youmans case were briefly as follows: Youmans
                            and his companions had been attacked by a mob of Mexicans who had
                            surrounded a house in which they had sought refuge. After endeavoring
                            unsuccessfully to quiet the mob, the mayor of the municipality had
                            ordered that state troops proceed to the scene of the disturbance to
                            quell the riot. Upon arriving at the scene of the riot, the troops,
                            instead of dispersing the mob, opened fire on the house, causing the
                            death of one of the Americans. Several members of the mob approached the
                            house from the rear and set fire to the roof. Youmans and his remaining
                            companions were forced to leave the house and, as they did so, were
                            killed by the troops and members of the mob. In holding the Mexican
                            Government responsible in damages for the deaths resulting from failure
                            to provide adequate <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0270"/>protection
                            to the murdered men and for the action of the troops in participating in
                            the murder, the Commission said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Evidence before the Commission does not disclose whose weapons
                                    killed the Americans, but the participation of soldiers with
                                    members of the mob is established. It cannot properly be said
                                    that adequate protection is afforded to foreigners in a case in
                                    which the proper agencies of the law to afford protection
                                    participate in murder.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>These are but two of many available evidences of the applicable principle
                            of international law which establish the existence of liability for
                            wrongful death of foreigners at the hands of officials, under such
                            circumstances as obtained in this case.</p>
                        <p>Whereas, in the two cases just mentioned, there was no evidence to show
                            that the deaths in question resulted from the acts of the respective
                            officials involved, it seems to be clearly established in the present
                            case, by the confession of the murderer as well as by other evidence,
                            that the murder was the act of an official of the Government of the
                            Dominican Republic who was charged by that Government with the duty of
                            protecting the life which he destroyed.</p>
                        <p>You will, therefore, present to the Foreign Office a formal claim for the
                            death of Colom in the sum of $5,000 and give expression to this
                            Government’s hope and expectation that this most revolting murder will
                            be properly disavowed and requited by the prompt payment of the
                            indemnity so clearly owing to the heirs of the deceased.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 241 of March 27, 1934 (File
                            No. 439.11[c] Colom, Eduardo/25 [<hi rend="italic">27</hi>])and its two

                            Colom y Piris, an American citizen, and instructing the Legation to
                            present to the Foreign Office a formal claim for the death of Colom in
                            the sum of $5,000.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with the Department’s instruction, I have transmitted a
                            note, No. 162 of April 4, 1934, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
                            together with copies of the two enclosures to the Department’s
                            instruction. A copy of that note is enclosed herewith,<note n="26"

                        <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0271"/>
                        <p>When I discussed with the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday the
                            matter of the presentation of a formal diplomatic claim in this case,
                            Lcdo. Logroño showed great concern. In referring to my instructions to
                            present the claim, I told the Minister that it was a source of personal
                            regret to me to be obliged, for the first time during my service at this
                            post, to make such a demand upon the Dominican Government, intimating at
                            the same time that the necessity for doing so was the more deplorable in
                            view of the circumstances in which Colom was murdered. The Minister’s
                            concern seemed to have reference, however, rather to the general moral
                            effect of this incident upon the prestige of General Trujillo’s
                            administration and upon its credit in pending financial negotiations in
                            the United States, than to contrition for the inherent brutality of the
                            crime itself and the possibility of its constituting a revelation of the
                            methods sometimes said to be used here in suppressing what is deemed to
                            be political opposition either in act or speech.</p>

                            Piris, an American citizen, in the sum of $5,000. The Department notes

                            the time you discussed this case with him on April 4 last.</p>
                        <p>As you are aware, the purpose of demanding indemnity in this class of
                            cases is not only that of recovering damages for the injured nationals,
                            but also that of indirectly extending protection to other nationals by
                            way of impressing upon the delinquent governments the seriousness of
                            permitting to exist conditions which place in jeopardy the lives and
                            fortunes of foreign nationals. From the standpoint of both of these
                            objectives, it is desired that you keep this case before the attention
                            of the Foreign Office in the sense of the instruction No. 241 of March
                            27, 1934, and that you press for a settlement thereof.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 249 of April 18, 1934, (File No. 439.11 C
                            Colom, Eduardo/32 [<hi rend="italic">33</hi>]), and to previous
                            correspondence with regard to the presentation to the Dominican
                            Government of a formal claim for the murder in the Dominican Republic of
                            Eduardo Colom y Piris, an American citizen, and to inform the Department
                            that since the presentation of this claim by means of my note of April 4
                            I have had several conversations with the Minister of Foreign Affairs on
                            the subject.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly informed me orally that
                            the Dominican Government’s action in this case would be favorable. On
                            one occasion, in discussing the case on April 26 last he stated that,
                            although the Dominican Government’s view of the question was that it had
                            no liability, he believed that in view of the relatively small indemnity
                            demanded and the desire of the Dominican Government to have no question
                            outstanding with our Government that might impede the settlement of
                            other important matters pending with the United States, it was
                            nevertheless likely that the indemnity demanded would be paid.</p>
                        <p>Today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs told me that he had prepared his
                            recommendations on the subject and submitted them to the President some
                            time ago. I assume that his recommendations were in line with his oral
                            statements above reported. Lcdo. Logroño added that the President had
                            turned over to the Legal Adviser of the Executive Power the file in this
                            case in order to obtain that official’s opinion. The Minister expected,
                            however, that the Legal Adviser’s opinion would be rendered very shortly
                            and he intended as soon as that opinion was available to send an
                            official reply to my note of April 4.</p>

                            Foreign Affairs today I referred, as reported in greater detail in my

                            Foreign Office. The Colom y Piris case was mentioned incidentally in
                            this connection. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, without referring
                            explicitly to this case, intimated that he was encountering difficulty
                            in formulating the position of the Dominican Government as to it. He
                            gave me quite clearly to understand that the difficulties in question
                            were related to the attitude of President Trujillo himself, though the
                            Minister did not say so, and assured me that he would do his best to
                            bring this matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

                                xml:id="d192fn29">Despatch No. 1902 not printed.</note> in regard to
                            the claim against the Dominican Government for the murder of Eduardo
                            Colom y Piris, I have the honor to report that I again spoke to the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs today in regard to the case.</p>
                        <p>Lcdo. Logroño stated that he was preparing a draft of a note in the
                            matter for submission to the President for the latter’s approval and
                            that he believed the note would be transmitted to the Legation before
                            October 3 next. It will be recalled that Lcdo. Logroño has made similar
                            promises on several previous occasions.</p>
                        <p>He indicated that the note would probably be brief and would only contain
                            an acknowledgment of the Legation’s note of April 4 and a statement to
                            the effect that the Dominican Government, in paying the indemnity, did
                            so to comply with what might be considered international obligations,
                            although the Government would admit no responsibility in the matter. He
                            added that in his opinion the responsibility of the Dominican Government
                            in this case was not of greater import than would be the responsibility
                            of a householder whose servant broke a window in a neighboring house. He
                            stated that he had discussed the matter with the President on the
                            evening of September 20 and that the President’s views concurred with
                            what he had just told me. It would appear that the Dominican Government
                            may be having difficulty in expressing an admission, and at the same
                            time a denial, of responsibility in the matter.</p>
                        <p>In a general way, I gathered that the difficulty encountered by the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs in formulating a note to the Legation may
                            also be concerned with the fear that, in answering the Legation’s note
                            of April 4, the Dominican Government might imply complicity of the
                            higher authorities in the death of Colom y Piris, a serious matter,
                            whereas the Dominican Government apparently considers the killing of
                            Colom y Piris as an unauthorized act of a subordinate official of the
                            Government, and therefore, a minor matter, not involving the
                            responsibility of the higher authorities to an appreciably greater
                            extent than the killing of Colom y Piris by a private person would have
                            involved their responsibility.</p>
                        <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0275"/>
                        <p>The Minister of Foreign Affairs went on to say, with general reference to
                            the Colom y Piris case, that a matter of major importance to the
                            Dominican Government, that of its funded debt, which had been pending,
                            he said, for a year and a half, had necessarily influenced the
                            Government’s attitude toward other matters which he classed as of
                            secondary importance. This rather frank statement on the part of Lcdo.
                            Logroño again confirms previous reports by the Legation that action was
                            intentionally delayed on matters pending between our Government and the
                            Dominican Government, owing to the presumed lack of attention on the
                            part of our Government, which the Dominican Government appears to have
                            believed should have been given by our Government, to expediting the
                            negotiations concerning the Dominican funded debt.</p>
                        <p>While what I have been able to learn would not appear to be conclusive,
                            the supposed attitude of President Trujillo in regard to the Colom y
                            Piris case has probably been of a two-fold nature. It was probably based
                            in part, until the termination of the debt negotiations,<note n="30"
                                xml:id="d192fn30">See <ref target="#pg_189">pp. 189</ref> ff.</note>
                            on his unfavorable general attitude toward matters pending between our
                            Government and the Dominican Government because of the delay in
                            obtaining a re-adjustment of the service of the funded debt,
                            satisfactory to the Dominican Government. In addition, however, his
                            supposed attitude in regard to the case, from the beginning of it, has
                            probably been based in large part on his desire not to acknowledge the
                            responsibility of the Dominican Government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to advise the Department
                            that Mr. George Kinkel, an American missionary residing in Guayaquil,
                            has through the Consulate General inquired if the Legation can use its
                            good offices with the Ecuadoran Government with a view to obtaining
                            permission for three missionaries to reside in Ecuador. The
                            circumstances as submitted to the Legation are as follows:</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kinkel represents an organization known in Guayaquil as the Uníon
                            Misionera Evangélica and which, according to my information, is
                            maintained by the Gospel Missionary Union with headquarters in Kansas
                            City. This organization desires to send to Ecuador as missionaries Miss
                            Edith Kruse, Miss Mabel Alton, and Miss Alice Schlueter. The Ecuadoran
                            Consulate General in New York, to which application was made for visas,
                            stated that special permission would have to be obtained from the
                            Ecuadoran Minister of Government. On October 19, 1934, Mr. Kinkel
                            applied to the Minister of Government for the necessary permission in a
                            communication in which he stated that, while his organization calls its
                            representatives missionaries, they are not “religiosos” (members of any
                            religious order); and that they teach the poor to read, etc., giving
                            them spiritual instruction concerning a better life. Under date of
                            October 25, the Minister of Government informed Mr. Kinkel that he had
                            telegraphed the Governor of Guayas authorizing the entrance of the three
                            ladies in question for a period of forty days.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Kinkel has requested the Consulate General to bring the matter to the
                            attention of the Legation in the hope that authorization for a longer
                            residence can be obtained.</p>
                        <p>In reply, I have informed the Consulate General that the Legation is
                            unable to take any action without instructions from the Department and
                            that the circumstances are being brought to the Department’s
                            attention.</p>

                                    establishment of Religious Communities, Orders, or Congregations
                                    and Novitiates in the towns where they did not formerly

                                <item>Art. 3. The Minister of the Interior and Police, who is
                                    charged with the execution of the present Decree, may, in
                                    exceptional cases, permit the entrance of a foreign religious
                                    person (<hi rend="italic">religioso</hi>) into the country for a
                                    period which shall not exceed forty days.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>The foregoing decree was issued for the purpose of clarifying Articles 5
                            and 6 of the Law of Worship of October 13, 1904, which read as follows: <list>
                                <item>Art. 5. In conformity with the Constitution, the immigration
                                    of religious communities is prohibited.</item>
                                <item>Art. 6. The foundation of new religious orders is likewise
                                    prohibited as is also the novitiate for the future in convents
                                    providing for perpetual retirement or a contemplative
                                    life.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>As will be observed, Articles 5 and 6 of the Law of Worship refer
                            specifically to religious communities or orders. Art. 1 of the decree of
                            September 22, 1927, prohibits the immigration of “religiosos”, a word
                            which in its broader sense may mean a “religious person” and is used
                            more specifically as designating members of religious orders. That the
                            decree is directed primarily against members of religious orders would
                            seem to be indicated by the phrase “whatever may be the Religious
                            Community, Order, or Congregation to which they belong” as well as by
                            the text of Art. 5 of the Law of Worship. However this may be, it
                            appears that in practice the Ecuadoran Government has interpreted the
                            decree of September 22, 1927, as prohibiting the immigration of clerical
                            persons, both regular and secular, and that the decree has been rather
                            strictly enforced against the clergy of the Catholic Church. On the
                            other hand, it seems that for many years Protestant missionaries have
                            experienced little or no difficulty in entering Ecuador for
                            residence.</p>

                                Missionaries</hi>.</p>
                        <p>The recent action of the Minister of Government in reply to Mr. Kinkel’s
                            application would seem to indicate a change in the official attitude
                            towards Protestant missionaries.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed the matter with Mr. John D. Clark, a British subject,
                            who has resided in Ecuador for a number of years on behalf of the
                            Christian and Missionary Alliance, of New York City. This is the most
                            important of the Protestant missionary organizations represented in
                            Ecuador. Mr. Clark informs me that up to very recently persons sent to
                            Ecuador for missionary work by his organization experienced no
                            difficulty in obtaining visas from Ecuadoran consular officers in the
                            United States and were admitted without question on arrival. He states,
                            however, that in August of this year the local authorities in Guayaquil
                            were criticized for having admitted without special permission Mr.
                            Robert B. Brown, a member of the New York Board of the Alliance, who
                            visited Ecuador temporarily, and whose admission as a tourist was
                            subsequently authorized by the Minister of Government. Early in
                            September, the Guayaquil authorities detained pending authorization of
                            the Minister a missionary, Mr. D. F. Siemens, who had previously resided
                            in Ecuador and was returning from a vacation in the United States. Mr.
                            Siemens had been granted a visa by the Ecuadoran consular representative
                            in Los Angeles and his readmission was eventually authorized by the
                            Minister of Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Clark believes that there is a tendency on the part of the
                            authorities to interpret and apply existing legislation more strictly as
                            respects Protestant missionaries. He said that this might be due to
                            opposition to their activities on the part of either Catholics or
                            Socialists.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the matter with Mr. Clark, I made it very plain that I was
                            merely seeking information and that he must not assume that the Legation
                            would be in a position to take the matter up with the Ecuadoran
                            Government.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>.</p>
                        <p>While it might appear that there is some room for argument as to whether
                            Protestant missionaries are “religiosos” within the meaning of the
                            decree of September 22, 1927, it is probable that the Ecuadoran
                            Government will hold that the interpretation of Ecuadoran legislation is
                            a question for its decision and that, if it chooses to place
                            restrictions on the entrance of Protestant missionaries, it has the
                            right to do so provided there is no discrimination as respects nationals
                            of different countries.</p>
                        <p>I am inclined to doubt if it would be advisable or serve any useful
                            purpose for the Legation to make any representations, informal or <pb
                                n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0281"/>otherwise, in behalf of Mr.
                            Kinkel or in any other similar cases in which Protestant missionaries
                            may be denied permission to reside in Ecuador.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, it may be recalled that, although a liberal, the
                            present President of Ecuador was elected with the support of the
                            Conservative Party which is ardent in its attachment to the Catholic
                            Church.</p>

                            assistance from Mr. George Kinkel, an American missionary residing in
                            Guayaquil, in obtaining permission for three missionaries to reside in

                            missionaries, it has the right to do so, provided there is no
                            discrimination as among the nationals of different countries, and that
                            it would be inadvisable for the Legation to make any representations in

                        <p>2. We have in mind a plan for dealing with the abnormal situation in
                            Central America arising out of non-recognition of the Martínez regime
                            which we would like to submit for your comment and suggestions in the
                            light of any talks you may have had at Montevideo. If you approve we
                            will take it up with the President and, subject to his authorization,
                            broach it in Central America.</p>
                        <p>As you will recall, Martínez came into power in December, 1931, following
                            a revolution. Having been Minister of War at the time of the revolution
                            he was clearly barred from recognition under the terms of the Central
                            American 1923 General Treaty of Peace and Amity.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d197fn3"><hi rend="italic">Conference on Central American
                                    Affairs, Washington, December 4, 1922–February 7, 1923</hi>
                                (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1923), p. 287.</note> The
                            other four Central American states declined to recognize him, and the
                            United States, while of course not a party to the Treaty, nevertheless
                            declined recognition, in line with our policy of supporting the efforts
                            of the Central American states to discourage revolution in their
                            countries. Salvador and Costa Rica both denounced the Treaty, their
                            denunciation taking effect January 1 of this year. The Treaty, under its
                            terms, remains in effect among the other three states. We are now
                            advised that Costa Rica has recognized Martínez as of January 1.</p>
                        <p>The plan we have in mind to deal with this situation is as follows: That
                            agreement be reached between the Presidents of Guatemala, Honduras and
                            Nicaragua providing in effect that, in view of the denunciation by Costa
                            Rica and Salvador of the Treaty, and pending a revision of that Treaty,
                            the three Presidents declare that their Governments, <pb n="217"
                                xml:id="pg_217" facs="0283"/>while regarding the Treaty as being in
                            force with respect to the relations maintained by the three states with
                            each other, do not regard it as being in force with respect to the
                            relations of those states with Costa Rica and Salvador. Following the
                            signature of such an agreement, the three Governments in question would
                            extend recognition to the Martínez Government; the United States would
                            extend recognition simultaneously. The agreement between the three
                            Presidents would also provide for the calling at a later date of another
                            Conference of the Central American states to consider a revision of the
                            General Treaty of Peace and Amity and such action relating to the other
                            treaties signed in 1923 as might appear appropriate. It is our idea that
                            this subsequent Conference should not be held in Washington. If the
                            Central American states desired us to be present unofficially as
                            observers, we would of course be willing to do this and to assist in any
                            way we appropriately could.</p>
                        <p>Our thought is to broach this plan informally to President Sacasa of
                            Nicaragua through Minister Lane, with the suggestion that Sacasa, if the
                            idea appeals to him, either might put it forward as his own initiative
                            with the Presidents of Guatemala and Honduras; or, if Sacasa preferred,
                            Mr. Lane could visit Guatemala (Minister Hanna is absent) and suggest to
                            President Ubico that he take the initiative in the matter.</p>
                        <p>It would be our consistent purpose throughout the suggested negotiation
                            to have the initiative taken by the Central American States and to have
                            any suggestions emanating from us regarded as strictly confidential. Our
                            participation in the matter, consequently, would be strictly behind the
                            scenes. If the plan is carried out, the obvious advantages are the
                            possibility of immediate recognition of the Government of Salvador by
                            our own Government after such action had been taken by the other Central
                            American Governments and subsequently the amendment of the principal
                            treaties and conventions of 1923 in such a manner as experience has
                            shown to be desirable to those of the Central American Governments as
                            wish their continuance.</p>

                        <p>For Phillips from Hull. Your January 3, 5 [<hi rend="italic">2</hi>] p.m.
                            I am interested in proposed Salvadoran recognition plans. There was no
                            definite effort to bring out this matter at Montevideo. The Central <pb
                                n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0284"/>American delegations did not
                            undertake to discuss it with me to this end. The Salvadoran delegate did
                            urge recognition and I indicated kind feelings toward his government but
                            offered no definite comment on recognition. Sorry cannot offer any
                            light. However, from this distance I can see no objection to submitting
                            this to the President for his approval.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: I am submitting for your
                            consideration, with the approval of the Secretary of State, who has been
                            consulted by cable, a suggested procedure for arriving at the
                            recognition of the present government of El Salvador by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The Central American countries, meeting in Washington, in 1923, at the
                            invitation of the Government of the United States, signed a Treaty of
                            Peace and Amity, intended principally to discourage revolution, in
                            which, among other things, they agreed not to recognize as president, in
                            the case of a Central American Government coming into power through a
                            revolution or <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>, anyone who had been a
                            leader of the revolution or <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> or who
                            had held a cabinet office in the six months preceding the revolution or
                                <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi>.</p>
                        <p>In December, 1931, a military revolt in El Salvador resulted in the
                            elevation to the presidency of General Maximiliano Hernández Martínez.
                            Since General Martínez had been Minister of War until within two or
                            three days prior to the revolution, the other Central American Republics
                            declined to recognize him as President. In accordance with a policy,
                            already announced and well established, of supporting the Treaty, the
                            United States also declined to recognize General Martínez.</p>
                        <p>Subsequently, however, both El Salvador and Costa Rica denounced the
                            Treaty in accordance with provisions contained therein, to take effect
                            as of January 1, 1934, and on that date Costa Rica extended recognition
                            to the government of General Martínez. His government is still
                            unrecognized by Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In view of the denunciation of the Treaty by El Salvador and Costa Rica,
                            it is suggested that the three remaining Central American <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0285"/>countries, to which the Treaty still
                            applies, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, might agree among themselves
                            to regard the Treaty as being in force with respect to the relations
                            maintained by said three States with each other, but not in force with
                            respect to the relations of those States with Costa Rica and El
                            Salvador. Since the Treaty is the only obstacle to recognition of El
                            Salvador, the agreement not to apply its terms to countries that have
                            denounced it would be followed by the recognition of the present
                            government of El Salvador by the three Central American countries
                            mentioned, and by the United States.</p>
                        <p>The agreement would also contemplate the calling, at some future date, of
                            another conference of the Central American States to consider a revision
                            of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity and such action relating to the
                            other treaties signed in 1923 as might appear appropriate. It is
                            believed that such a conference should be held in some other place than
                            Washington; and that the United States should take no active or leading
                            part in the proceedings, while holding itself ready to lend unofficial
                            aid or counsel, in the role of an observer, if requested to do so by the
                            Central American States.</p>
                        <p>It is the intention, if the present plan meets your approval, to instruct
                            Minister Lane, in Nicaragua, to suggest it informally to President
                            Sacasa with the suggestion that the latter, if the idea appeals to him,
                            put it forward as his own initiative with the Presidents of Guatemala
                            and Honduras.</p>
                        <p>It would be our purpose throughout the suggested negotiation to have the
                            initiative taken by the Central American States and to have any
                            suggestions emanating from this country regarded as strictly
                            confidential.</p>
                        <p>Reports from El Salvador indicate that General Martínez has given his
                            country a relatively efficient government and is strongly supported by
                            public opinion. His government has been recognized by a majority of the
                            principal nations of the world. There are indications that the three
                            Central American Governments which have not recognized El Salvador would
                            be glad to extend recognition if they could do so consistently with
                            their treaty obligations. The procedure suggested herein, by leading to
                            the recognition of El Salvador by the three Republics of Central America
                            which have withheld recognition, and by the United States, would
                            constitute another and important step in the establishment of normal,
                            friendly relations among all the nations of America.</p>
                        <p>Faithfully yours,</p>

                        <p>2. Chargé d’Affaires of Honduras informed me confidentially this morning
                            that he had been instructed by his Government to ascertain the point of
                            view of Nicaraguan Government regarding Costa Rican denunciation of
                            Central American treaty of 1923 and also to obtain the opinion of this
                            Legation. Dr. Gomez Osorio added that he had conferred with President
                            Sacasa and that both had the following impression: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>As under article 18 of treaty denunciations would not appear
                                    possible until January 1, 1934, no denunciation can take effect
                                    until one year after that date (January 1, 1935).</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>Treaty is thereby violated by Costa Rican action but is not
                                    broken. I told Chargé d’Affaires that the interpretation of the
                                    terms of a treaty is outside of the province of this
                                    Legation.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Prior to Chargé’s call I had made appointment to see President Sacasa on
                            another matter at noon. He referred to having received telegram from
                            Mrs. Sacasa, who flew to Tegucigalpa on Friday at the invitation of
                            President of Honduras, stating that she had just received an invitation
                            to visit San Salvador on her return trip and proposed to do so. The
                            President said that her telegram did not indicate whether invitation had
                            been extended by President Martínez but that in any case visit would be
                            purely private and should not be given any further significance. He said
                            he did not propose to recognize the present government of El Salvador.
                            (He said he had no official notification that Costa Rica had recognized
                            General Martínez government.) He stated he considers that treaty is an
                            assurance against revolutions and particularly against military <hi
                                rend="italic">coups d’etat</hi> and as such should be kept in force,
                            perhaps with such modifications as would enable all Central American
                            countries to adhere in harmony with their respective constitutional
                            provisions. He added that he is certain Guatemala and Honduras will act
                            with Nicaragua in supporting treaty. He expressed his regret that all
                            Central American governments had not acted in identical manner,
                            concerted action among them being in his opinion essential to their good
                            relations with one another. The President’s statement regarding
                            Nicaraguan attitude was voluntary on his part, I not wishing, in the
                            absence of instructions to the contrary, to have him infer from any
                            question on my part that we expected Nicaragua to adopt any attitude
                            different from that which has been maintained here. I did not mention to
                            the President my visit from Honduran Chargé d’Affaires.</p>

                        <p>With respect to reports regarding friction between Nicaragua and
                            Honduras, Chargé told me he had given statement this morning to
                            Associated Press that such reports are unfounded. The President likewise
                            said that one reason for Mrs. Sacasa’s trip to Honduras was to give
                            evidence of good relations existing. As Sandino’s so-called
                            representative Dr. Zepeda has told me of possibility of armed conflict
                            between the two countries it is possible that such a condition may be a
                            pretext for his having requested 20,000 rounds of ammunition from the
                            Government (General Somoza told me that he had learned confidentially

                        <p>2. Your 2, January 8, 8 p.m. It has come to our attention that the three
                            Central American Governments which have not recognized the government of
                            General Martínez in El Salvador would in fact be glad to extend
                            recognition if they could do so consistently with their treaty
                            obligations, thereby clearing up the anomalous situation which has so
                            long existed in Central America and constituting another important step
                            in the establishment of normal friendly relations among all the nations
                            of America.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing in mind you are instructed to approach President
                            Sacasa in strict confidence with the suggestion that he and the
                            Presidents of Honduras and Guatemala might desire to reach an agreement
                            more or less in the following terms: “In view of the denunciation by
                            Costa Rica and El Salvador of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity
                            signed at Washington by the five republics of Central America on
                            February 7, 1923, and pending a revision of that Treaty, the three
                            Presidents signing this agreement declare that the Governments of the
                            three States over which they respectively preside shall regard that
                            Treaty as being in force with respect to the relations maintained by
                            said three States, with each other, but not in force with respect to the
                            relations of those States with Costa Rica and El Salvador.”</p>
                        <p>You may suggest to President Sacasa that if the plan appeals to him, he
                            may wish to put it forward as his own initiative with the Presidents of
                            Guatemala and Honduras.</p>
                        <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0288"/>
                        <p>It is contemplated that such an agreement between the three Presidents
                            would clear the way for and be followed immediately by the recognition
                            of the present government of El Salvador by the three Central American
                            Governments and the United States acting independently.</p>
                        <p>The agreement as indicated would contemplate the calling at some early
                            date of another conference of the Central American States to consider a
                            revision of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity and such action
                            relating to the other treaties signed in 1923 as might appear
                            appropriate, as well as such other matters as might seem of common
                            advantage. It is our thought that such a conference should be held in
                            some place other than Washington and that the United States should take
                            no active or leading part in the proceedings, while holding itself ready
                            to lend unofficial aid or counsel in the role of an observer if
                            requested to do so by the Central American States.</p>
                        <p>In your conversations with President Sacasa, you should bear in mind that
                            it would be our purpose throughout the suggested negotiation to have the
                            initiative taken by the Central American States and to have any
                            suggestions emanating from us regarded as strictly confidential.</p>
                        <p>A strictly confidential intimation has been made to this Government by
                            the Government of El Salvador of its desire to have a new Central
                            American Conference called. We are likewise given to understand that the
                            Government of Costa Rica would not actively oppose the holding of such a
                            conference. In our judgment, should the present abnormal situation which
                            exists with regard to the Government of El Salvador be terminated, the
                            holding of the suggested Central American Conference in the manner above
                            described would be of decided usefulness both to the Central American
                            nations themselves and to the relations between the Central American
                            nations and this Government.</p>
                        <p>Please confer with President Sacasa at the earliest opportunity and
                            report in full by cable.</p>

                        <p>4. I took up with President Sacasa today the subject contained in the
                            Department’s telegram 2, January 9, 2 p.m., and emphasized the
                            desirability of the action being initiated by him. He said that the
                            proposal had his enthusiastic approval and that he would immediately
                            consult a few close advisers to make certain that there would be no <pb
                                n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0289"/>legal objections and then
                            inform me as to the specific steps he would propose to take. His present
                            intention would be, he said, to send personal representatives, one to
                            Tegucigalpa and the other to Guatemala, to obtain the reaction of the
                            respective Presidents and if favorable then to make public a telegram to
                            those Presidents setting forth the proposal. He stated that he is
                            certain that the President of Guatemala will agree and is fairly
                            confident that President of Honduras will concur.</p>
                        <p>He made, however, the following suggestions: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That following phrase be amended “but not in force with
                                    respect to the relations of those states with Costa Rica and El
                                    Salvador” as he appears to feel that the specific reference to
                                    Costa Rica and El Salvador might cause unnecessary irritation
                                    and thus serve to hinder successful culmination of plan. He
                                    likewise suggested that something to the following effect be
                                    added “they propose the calling at some early date of another
                                    Conference of the Central American States to consider a revision
                                    of the General Treaty of Peace and Amity and such action
                                    relating to the other treaties signed in 1923 as might appear
                                    appropriate, as well as such other matters as might seem of
                                    common advantage”.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>That he be authorized to have his representatives orally
                                    inform the Presidents of Guatemala and Honduras that his
                                    proposal has been discussed with me and that I have given him to
                                    understand that it meets with the Department’s approval and that
                                    our Government will, acting independently, recognize the present
                                    Government of El Salvador immediately following or
                                    simultaneously with the recognition by Nicaragua, Honduras and
                                    Guatemala. He states, I think with reason, that Honduras and
                                    Guatemala will immediately wish to know our attitude and that
                                    much time will be gained by his being able to give that
                                    assurance at the start. Because of discussion which has already
                                    begun in the press of possible recognition of El Salvador by the
                                    three Governments concerned and by the United States, he stated
                                    he considers the element of time to be essential; otherwise the
                                    negotiations may be seriously jeopardized by editorial comment.
                                    I concur. The press of today contains despatches from Panama
                                    indicating possibility of Conference of Central American
                                    countries there. As Panama is in public mind generally
                                    identified with United States influence, I think that perhaps an
                                    unfavorable impression would be created were conference to be
                                    held there. I respectfully suggest Mexico City would be an
                                    admirable meeting place. Such a choice would serve to disarm the
                                    suspicions which have existed there regarding our aims in
                                    Central America and might tend to bring about closer cooperation
                                    with Mexico on matters affecting this continent.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>I should be grateful to have at the earliest possible moment an
                            expression of the Department’s views of the President’s suggestions (1)
                            and (2). The President assured me that he appreciates the confidential
                            nature of this matter.</p>

                        <p>6. My 4, January 10, 5 p.m. When I called on the President this morning
                            he showed me a rough draft of an agreement, a protocol which he proposed
                            to submit through a confidential representative first to the President
                            of Salvador and then to Presidents of Honduras and Guatemala. Costa Rica
                            having recognized Salvador and having officially since confirmed a
                            letter of December 23, 1932, from Minister of Foreign Affairs to
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua, that it favored the calling of
                            a conference for revision of treaty of 1923, the approval of the
                            Government of Costa Rica would not in President Sacasa’s opinion seem
                            necessary at the outset although he stated he would advise that
                            Government later as a matter of courtesy.</p>
                        <p>This evening subsequent to my telephone conversation with Assistant
                            Secretary Welles I had a further conference with the President and told
                            him that his proposed agreement with certain changes (to which he
                            acquiesced) met with our approval in principle and that his
                            representative was at liberty to advise the other interested
                            Governments, orally and confidentially, that President Sacasa’s proposal
                            has our approval and that we are prepared to recognize present
                            Government of Salvador as soon as recognition is accorded by Guatemala,
                            Honduras and Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The President’s proposed agreement, as amended at an interview this
                            evening, which he emphasized was roughly drawn is substantially as
                            follows (obviously the language is imperfect in several instances from a
                            legal point of view but I considered it wise to refrain from objecting
                            as long as the principle were obtained): <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>4. Your 6, January 11, 10 p.m. The Department is deeply gratified by the
                            approval by President Sacasa of the friendly suggestion offered.</p>
                        <p>The form of the agreement as proposed by President Sacasa appears
                            satisfactorily to provide for the desired objectives.</p>
                        <p>In view, however, of the fact that the Governments of Guatemala and
                            Honduras, together with the Government of Nicaragua, are the
                            participants in the proposed agreement, it would seem to the Department
                            better policy for the representative of President Sacasa first to visit
                            the President of Guatemala and the President of Honduras before
                            discussing the question at issue with President Martínez. It is feared
                            that possible friction might develop if Senator Sacasa entered into his
                            proposed conversation with President Ubico after discussion with
                            President Martínez. Please convey this suggestion tonight to President
                            Sacasa informally and explain to him fully the reasons behind it.</p>
                        <p>Please express to President Sacasa the Department’s appreciation of his
                            offer to keep you advised of developments and advise him of the interest
                            with which we shall follow the course of the negotiations.</p>

                        <p>1. President Sacasa has undertaken as of his own initiative to suggest
                            that he and the Presidents of Honduras and Guatemala reach an agreement
                            substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In view of the fact that the General Treaty of Peace and Amity
                                    is in full force with respect to Guatemala, Honduras and
                                    Nicaragua and that having been denounced by El Salvador and
                                    Costa Rica has ceased to be in effect with respect to relations
                                    between the first three and the last two, and it being of the
                                    greatest importance for the peace of Central America that the
                                    Treaty be revised, the following is agreed upon to be published: <list>
                                        <label>1.</label>
                                        <item>The Governments of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua
                                            shall immediately recognize the Government of El
                                            Salvador over which General Martínez presides.</item>

                                        <item>The Governments of Central America shall accredit
                                            representatives to the conference which will take place
                                            for the purpose indicated.”</item>

                        <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0292"/>
                        <p>Announcement of this agreement would be followed immediately by the
                            recognition of the present Government of El Salvador by the three
                            Central American Governments and by the United States acting
                            independently. The proposed agreement also contemplates the calling at
                            an early date of a conference of the Central American States to consider
                            matters of common interest.</p>
                        <p>President Sacasa intends sending as his representative his cousin,
                            Senator Crisanto Sacasa Saturday morning by airplane to Guatemala,
                            Tegucigalpa, and San Salvador. He has been authorized through the
                            American Minister in Managua to permit his representative to advise the
                            other interested Governments, orally and confidentially, that his
                            proposal meets with the approval of this Government and that the United
                            States is prepared to recognize the present Government of Salvador as
                            soon as recognition is accorded by Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
                            You may confirm this understanding if you are approached by the
                            President or Minister of Foreign Affairs in the matter.</p>
                        <p>In the opinion of President Sacasa, since Costa Rica has recognized
                            Salvador and has since officially confirmed a letter of December 23,
                            1933, from her Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs of Nicaragua, that it favored the calling of a conference for a
                            revision of the Treaty of 1923, the approval of the Government of Costa
                            Rica would not seem necessary at the outset, although President Sacasa
                            intends to advise the Costa Rican Government later as a matter of
                            courtesy.</p>

                        <p>9. Department’s 4, January 12, 5 p.m., does not appear to have been filed
                            until 11:09 last night and was consequently not received here until this
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>The President whom I left just before noon told me that the procedure
                            contemplated is as follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>Senator Sacasa was to leave for San Salvador about noon (have
                                    ascertained from Pan American Airways that he actually did
                                    leave). Senator is to thank General Martínez for kindness to
                                    Mrs. Sacasa on her recent trip and to say that he is also
                                    proceeding to Guatemala and Honduras to confer with respective
                                    Presidents with a view to obtaining closer cooperation among
                                    Central American states having in mind revision of general
                                    treaty of 1923 and that he will confer further General Martínez
                                    on his return trip. (Protocol to be signed is not to be shown to
                                    anybody in El Salvador until it has been signed by Presidents of
                                    Guatemala and Honduras).</item>

                                    Salvador to Guatemala tomorrow morning by plane and submit
                                    unsigned copy of protocol to President Ubico (translation of
                                    text as signed by President Sacasa yesterday has been
                                    transmitted in my 8, January 13, 1 p.m.). If Ubico approves the
                                    text, signed original is then to be offered him for his
                                    signature (since seeing the President he has sent me word that
                                    President Ubico has telegraphed he will be glad to receive the
                                    Senator tomorrow morning).</item>

                                <item>If signed in Guatemala similar procedure is then to be
                                    followed in Tegucigalpa, San Salvador and San José in that
                                    order.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>As the procedure outlined does not envisage the discussion of the
                            question at issue with President Martínez until Senator Sacasa has
                            interviewed Presidents Ubico and Carías it would seem that the
                            suggestion made in the Department’s telegram under acknowledgment is to
                            be followed. President Sacasa told me, however, that he is fully alive
                            to the danger of the agreement being frustrated because of friction
                            between President Ubico and General Martínez and that he accordingly had
                            instructed his cousin to deal with each in the most tactful manner so as
                            to avoid injuring their susceptibilities.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that it would be helpful if our representatives
                            in Guatemala exert informal good offices with the respective Governments
                            explaining our position in order to facilitate the mission of Senator
                            Sacasa. I told him I would transmit his suggestion to the
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>In regard to my inquiry as to whether it would be legally possible for
                            the five “Presidents of the Republics of Central America” to sign, as
                            such, an agreement prior to the recognition of General Martínez by
                            Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras, the President said that the protocol
                            is intended to be a private arrangement between the five.</p>

                        <p>11. My 9, January 13, 3 [<hi rend="italic">2?</hi>] p.m. At President
                            Sacasa’s request I called on him at 10 o’clock tonight. He showed me
                            what purported to be true reading of cipher message from Crisanto Sacasa
                            in Guatemala stating that “President Ubico desires a direct suggestion
                            from the Department of State and is ready to consult”. The President
                            said that he had instructed Senator Sacasa in reply to await in
                            Guatemala the result of the suggestions which he hoped the Department
                            would make. He said that he considers it essential to the successful
                            conclusion of the project that some word be sent by the Department to
                            President Ubico <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0295"/>immediately to
                            the effect that the Department has learned of President Sacasa’s plan
                            and that the Department is in sympathy with it and hopes that General
                            Ubico will agree thereto. (The President said that the foregoing
                            telegram from Guatemala is the first word he has had from Senator Sacasa
                            since his departure and accordingly does not know whether the document,
                            translation of which was sent in my telegram 8,<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d208fn8">January 13, 1 p.m., <ref target="#pg_226">p.
                                    226</ref>.</note> has yet been shown to General Ubico. For that
                            reason the President expressed the belief that it would be advisable for
                            the time being not to mention that document in any suggestion which the
                            Department might see fit to make to Guatemala).</p>
                        <p>The President said that the Congress of El Salvador sent to Nicaraguan
                            Congress on Friday a message requesting that latter exert influence on
                            Nicaraguan Government to recognize General Martínez and that unless
                            prompt action be taken by Guatemala, it may be thought that steps
                            towards recognition will be as a result of congressional pressure. He
                            said he wished to avoid this impression being created. He expressed the
                            hope that it might be possible for the Department to talk by telephone
                            to President Ubico tomorrow (Monday) thus enabling Senator Sacasa to
                            proceed to Tegucigalpa Tuesday. If it would be impracticable to talk
                            directly with General Ubico he suggested that American Chargé d’Affaires
                            at Guatemala be instructed to acquaint the President at once with our
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated the suggestion made to me Saturday, as reported in
                            my 9, January 13, 3 p.m., that Minister Lay be apprised of our attitude
                            so as to be in a position to advise President Carías.</p>

                        <p>1. Your 1, January 12, 5 p.m., and 3, January 15, 2 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >1</hi>] p.m. Acting Foreign Minister has just informed me that
                            President Ubico is notifying President Sacasa at once that he agrees to
                            his plan and will be glad to fix date for recognition announcement.
                            Apparently Crisanto Sacasa gave President Ubico the impression that the
                            plan was suggested to President Sacasa by the American Government which
                            at first caused unfavorable reaction as President Ubico felt that if the
                            suggestion came from Washington it should have been made to him rather
                            than to President Sacasa. However, I feel that I have corrected that
                            impression by assurances that the plan was wholly initiated by
                            Nicaraguan Government. Acting Foreign Minister made clear that
                            Guatemalan agreement was chiefly due to the Department’s sympathetic
                            attitude toward plan.</p>

                        <p>12. Information contained in Department’s telegrams 5, January 15, 1
                            p.m., and 6, January 15, 2 p.m., was orally communicated to President
                            Sacasa yesterday afternoon. This morning on receipt of Lawton’s January
                            15, 6 p.m., to the Department I called on the President who said he was
                            asked to send for me with regard to developments in Guatemala. He
                            referred to report from Guatemala published in press this morning to the
                            effect that in political circles there it is considered that Guatemala
                            will be an important factor in the problem of the recognition of El
                            Salvador by the rest of Central America. I said that I had learned that
                            apparently Crisanto Sacasa had given President Ubico the impression that
                            the plan for the recognition of El Salvador had been suggested to the
                            Niearaguan Government by the United States Government. I urged that he
                            instruct Crisanto” Sacasa in the latter’s negotiations with the
                            President of Honduras to be careful to prevent this impression from
                            being created. The President said he would telegraph his cousin
                            substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In your conversations with President Carías remember that the
                                    plan which was proposed by me and was then discussed with
                                    American Minister here, has the approval of the United States
                                    Government.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>I pointed out to the President that his plan, being different in various
                            aspects from that suggested by the Department, may with truth be stated
                            as being his. The President said he felt sure that his cousin did not
                            give the impression, as reported in Lawton’s January 15, 6 p.m., but
                            that Ubico wished to take the credit for the proposal as the
                            abovementioned press report indicates.</p>
                        <p>The President said that his cousin following the despatch of his telegram
                            of January 14 (quoted in my 11, January 14, midnight) had apparently
                            awaited the result of expected conversation between Ubico and the
                            Department’s representative and had not as yet shown Ubico the draft
                            protocol, although his instructions were to stress three points to
                            Presidents Ubico and Carías, (1) joint resolution [<hi rend="italic"
                                >recognition?</hi>] of El Salvador by Nicaragua, Honduras and
                            Guatemala, (2) revision of treaty by all Central American countries, (3)
                            maintenance of treaty by Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua until
                            revised.</p>
                        <p>Foregoing not repeated to Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>Am sending supplementary telegram which am repeating to Guatemala.</p>

                        <p>14. Informed by Niearaguan Government officials that Honduran Chargé
                            d’Affaires left for Tegucigalpa this morning by plane to set forth to
                            his Government the views of President Sacasa in connection with the
                            proposed recognition of El Salvador.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of a talk which I had with him when I returned on
                            January 9 his call of January 8 I have had no further conversation with
                            Gomez Osorio subsequent to that mentioned in my 2, January 8, 8 p.m.
                            President Sacasa tells me that he has discussed his plan with him only
                            in a general way, it being his idea that details shall be taken up with
                            President Carías by his cousin, Senator Crisanto Sacasa, who has been
                            discussing matters with President [of] Guatemala.</p>

                            about Salvadoran situation. He expressed the positive opinion that
                            existing non-recognition policy had good effect in keeping down
                            revolutions and should be preserved. He also stated that the present
                            President of Salvador had no right to reelection under the Constitution
                            without being out of office 6 months. He then suggested that if he were
                            content to go out for 6 months and allow his successor under law to act
                            in the meantime and then secure his own election to the presidency our
                            Government could properly recognize him and his Government. This for
                            whatever it may be worth. Skinner Klee of Guatemala, Foreign Minister,
                            strongly supports present non-recognition policy.</p>

                        <p>1. President Sacasa has undertaken as of his own initiative to suggest
                            that he and the Presidents of Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica and the
                                <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> President of El Salvador reached an
                            agreement substantially as follows:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows text of draft agreement quoted in telegram No. 8, January
                            13, 1 p.m., from the Minister in Nicaragua, <ref target="#pg_226">page
                                226</ref>.]</p>
                        <p>President Sacasa has sent his cousin, Crisanto Sacasa, as his
                            representative to present the foregoing suggestion to the other
                            Presidents of Central America. His plan is understood to be to visit
                            Guatemala, Tegucigalpa, San Salvador and San José in the order named.
                            The American Minister in Managua has authorized President Sacasa to
                            permit his representative to advise the other interested governments
                            orally and confidentially that his proposal meets with the approval of
                            this Government and that the United States is prepared to recognize the
                            present government of El Salvador as soon as recognition is accorded by
                            Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. You may confirm this understanding if

                        <p>The Minister of Guatemala called to see me this morning. He stated that
                            he had just received a cable from his Government instructing him to
                            confirm the statements made to President Ubico both by Senator Sacasa,
                            the emissary of the President of Nicaragua, and by the American Chargé
                            d’Affaires in Guatemala that the United States Government favored the
                            suggested proposal of the President of Nicaragua looking towards
                            recognition of the Government of Salvador by the Governments of
                            Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, and subsequently by the Government of
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>I told the Minister that the attitude of the Government of the United
                            States towards the initiative taken by President Sacasa was that
                            indicated and that this Government strongly favored the proposal if it
                            met with the common agreement of the Governments of <pb n="235"
                                xml:id="pg_235" facs="0301"/>Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua as a
                            means of normalizing conditions in Central America and avoiding a
                            continuation of an abnormal situation which might tend to create
                            misunderstanding in Central America and which at the same time prevented
                            a resumption of normal and friendly relations between Salvador and the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>The Guatemalan Minister stated that President Ubico had informed him that
                            he was entirely in accord with the idea of an agreement between the
                            three republics for recognition of Salvador provided the United States
                            in fact approved the proposal. The Minister stated that in his opinion
                            this was merely a first step and that this first step could be
                            advantageous only if the five governments joined immediately thereafter
                            in a Central American conference to agree upon the contractual relations
                            which should exist between the five republics and to take the place of
                            the relations entered into in 1923 which had now been seriously modified
                            by the fact that Costa Rica and Salvador are no longer parties to the
                            1923 treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Minister spoke at some length regarding the satisfactory manner in
                            which President Martínez had maintained order in Salvador and the manner
                            in which he had at the same time provided for a very great measure of
                            liberty of speech and of the press. He was insistent that the relations
                            between his country and Salvador were entirely satisfactory and that the
                            step which it was now proposed to take to enter once more into formal
                            official relations was eminently desirable.</p>
                        <p>He expressed his personal hearty approval of the proposal emanating from
                            President Sacasa and of his complete identification with the point of
                            view adopted by the Department of State.</p>

                        <p>15. At the request of the President I called on him this evening. He
                            showed me two messages dated today from Guatemala, (1) from President
                            Ubico stating that Crisanto Sacasa and he had agreed that recognition of
                            El Salvador by Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras be made on January 25
                            and proposing that after recognition representatives of Nicaragua and
                            Guatemala should confer in Guatemala to fix date for inviting to a
                            conference delegates of those parties interested in Central American
                            treaties; (2) from Crisanto Sacasa confirming agreement with Ubico as to
                            January 25; stating that Ubico has discussed project with President
                            Carías and that everything is arranged between them except fixing the
                            date of recognition; suggesting that President Sacasa send a radio
                            telegram to Carías immediately; stating that Ubico thinks the suggested
                            protocol unnecessary as the questions covered therein can be discussed
                            by Nicaragua and Guatemala as soon as recognition is extended.</p>
                        <p>The President in expressing his disapproval of the proposed modification
                            of his plan stated that the Ubico project would entail a violation of
                            the general treaty on the part of the three countries; that the
                            recognition would have no purpose unless it be shown that the treaty
                            remains in force between the three; and that the action proposed would
                            destroy the idealism in the treaty. He expressed his fear lest
                            Guatemala, once the recognition were granted, would not agree to the
                            calling of a conference. The President said that he proposed tomorrow
                            morning early to telegraph to (1) President Carías to await the arrival
                            of Crisanto Sacasa, regarding whose trip he has been informed, before
                            definitely committing himself, (2) President Ubico that the date
                            proposed is entirely agreeable but requesting him earnestly to
                            reconsider the Sacasa proposal because of the importance <pb n="237"
                                xml:id="pg_237" facs="0303"/>of the maintenance of the spirit of the
                            treaty in keeping peace in Central America.</p>
                        <p>President Sacasa requested me to suggest to the Department that
                            telegraphic instructions be sent to our representatives in Guatemala and
                            Tegucigalpa to express to the respective Governments the hope that they
                            will support his proposal, providing for the maintenance of the treaty
                            as between the three and for the calling of a conference of the five
                            countries. I told him that I would be glad to transmit his request.</p>
                        <p>Assuming that Crisanto Sacasa’s telegram correctly sets forth Ubico’s
                            views (Ubico’s telegram appears to be silent as to the protocol and it
                            is not clear, from what Lawton in his January 17, 5 p.m.<note n="14"

                            include Honduras in the proposed preliminary talks regarding conference
                            to discuss treaty and (2) for the three countries to grant recognition
                            without appropriate reference to treaty of 1923.</p>

                        <p>3. Telegram from Minister at Managua January 17, 10 p.m.<note n="17"
                                xml:id="d223fn17">See penultimate paragraph of telegram No. 15, <hi
                                    rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> I inquired of Foreign Office
                            this morning as to whether President Ubico objected to first part of
                            Sacasa plan, namely, that immediately prior to recognition the three
                            Presidents should announce their agreement on continued validity of
                            Treaty as between themselves and on <pb n="238" xml:id="pg_238"
                                facs="0304"/>calling a conference of the five countries. I pointed
                            out that, although I had as yet received no instructions as to how the
                            Department would view recognition if this first step were omitted, the
                            Department had expressed its sympathy with the plan as originally
                            proposed by President Sacasa and not with recognition alone. Acting
                            Minister frankly admitted his Government was none too enthusiastic about
                            the proposal but said President Ubico had agreed to recognition because
                            he did not desire to stand out alone against the other Central American
                            States and the United States. Once recognition was agreed upon Ubico had
                            little interest in the other features of plan although he is willing to
                            participate in Central American conference. He feels the spirit and
                            principle of treaty are necessarily lost by recognition and that it is
                            useless to try to justify it by an explanation beforehand. Although
                            agreeing the treaty remains in force between Guatemala, Nicaragua and
                            Honduras, since none of them have denounced it, he feels it is useless
                            to pretend that recognition of Martínez is not a violation of its terms.
                            Finally, although willing enough to participate in a conference, it is
                            evident that Guatemalan Government would not take a new or modified
                            treaty very seriously. Notwithstanding these views Acting Foreign
                            Minister promised to point out to the President the fact that a
                            preliminary announcement in the sense indicated above was an essential
                            feature of the Sacasa plan and to see if he would approve it. Decision
                            on this point may not be reached until late this evening or
                            tomorrow.</p>

                            Please see President Ubico immediately and say that the Department very
                            much hopes that he will support Sacasa’s proposal as set out in Sacasa’s
                            draft protocol.</p>
                        <p>For your information, Sacasa’s draft protocol reads as follows:</p>

                            13, 1 p.m., from the Minister in Nicaragua, printed on <ref

                        <p>We agree with Lane’s reasons as set out in last paragraph of his No. 15.
                            Moreover, we feel it highly advisable, for the best interests of the
                            Central American states themselves, that the agreement between the
                            Presidents should provide definitely for the calling of a conference.
                            For your information, Lane has reported that President <pb n="239"
                                xml:id="pg_239" facs="0305"/>Sacasa considers his protocol as a

                        <p>16. My 15, January 17, 10 p.m. The President having left suddenly this
                            morning for León to attend a funeral I called on his private secretary
                            and on his brother Federico Sacasa jointly to ascertain latest
                            developments and to acquaint them with the substance of Lawton’s January
                            17, 5 p.m. They showed me paragraph 1 (telegram sent last night by
                            President Sacasa to President Carías) stating that Crisanto Sacasa who
                            had been unexpectedly delayed in Guatemala would soon proceed to
                            Tegucigalpa to submit protocol to Carías and urging Carías to postpone
                            definitive action on Ubico’s suggestion until he had had an opportunity
                            to consult with Crisanto Sacasa.</p>

                        <p>The private secretary of President Carías called at the Legation today to
                            inquire on behalf of the President as to the attitude of the United
                            States Government toward recognition of the present government of
                            Salvador in accordance with the plan proposed by President Sacasa. I
                            told him I was authorized to tell the President that my Government was
                            prepared to recognize the present government of Salvador as soon as
                            recognition is accorded by Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras. President
                            Carías told me later that Crisanto Sacasa was expected here from
                            Guatemala on January 20th and that while he (Carías) has agreed with
                            President Ubico upon recognition of Salvador he will await arrival of
                            Sacasa before deciding whether the Honduran Government would recommend
                            according recognition before or after holding a conference to draft the
                            proposed protocol. He seemed, however, to favor President Sacasa’s plan
                            rather than the modification proposed by President Ubico.</p>

                        <p>6. Your 4, Urgent, January 18, 2 p.m., received in its entirety January
                            19, 8 a.m. Have just had a long talk with President Ubico. Although
                            personally against recognition he is willing to carry out the agreement
                            to recognize Martínez January 25 and to join with President Sacasa after
                            recognition in inviting the five Central American Presidents to a
                            conference to be held in Guatemala in February for the purpose of
                            drawing up new treaties. He will not agree to enter into a private
                            arrangement in the sense proposed by President Sacasa before recognition
                            because he is afraid one or more of the Presidents parties to the
                            agreement would, once recognition was accorded Martínez, go back on
                            their word and refuse to participate in the conference. <pb n="242"
                                xml:id="pg_242" facs="0308"/>I asked him what difference there would
                            be between that and a refusal by one or more Governments of the
                            invitation to a conference issued after recognition. He replied that in
                            the latter case it would not matter as, if Martínez declined to
                            participate, he would lose the sympathy of the other republics and
                            become isolated. In other words, President Ubico does not want to
                            bargain with Martínez about recognition.</p>
                        <p>As to the necessity of referring to the 1923 treaty at the time of or
                            prior to recognition, he feels that such reference is useless in so far
                            as justifying the step in the light of the treaty is concerned. He does
                            not understand how President Sacasa or the Department can feel that the
                            treaty is not being violated. His position is that Salvador has not
                            denounced the treaty and that it is still in force with respect to
                            Salvador for all states that continue to be parties. He points out that
                            the Salvadorean denunciation was effected by a government which, by the
                            terms of the treaty itself, could not be recognized and that
                            consequently such denunciation could not be valid for the other
                            contracting states. Holding this view, he feels that any reference to
                            the treaty in connection with the recognition of Martínez would be
                            merely “eye wash” and would impress no one. However, he agrees that the
                            treaty continues in force for Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua and he
                            has no objection to the various Foreign Ministers pointing out that fact
                            to the press at the time recognition is announced. Beyond that he will
                            not go.</p>
                        <p>President Ubico is definitely of the opinion that a new treaty is
                            necessary to the peace of Central America; but he feels that in order to
                            be effective such a treaty should provide sanctions in the form of
                            collective investigation and, if necessary, force. He says that a treaty
                            without such sanctions would be no more than a “scrap of paper”.
                            Incidentally that term has been used in the past few days by several
                            Guatemalan officials all of whom are convinced, despite every
                            explanation of the contrary view, that recognition of Martínez is a
                            flagrant violation of the 1923 treaty. This attitude unfortunately
                            carries with it a somewhat cynical conception of the American
                            Government’s regard for international conventions and will inevitably
                            lessen the respect in which any future Central American treaty of peace
                            and amity is held, unless such treaty provides sanctions. Although many
                            Guatemalan officials (not including the President or Acting Foreign
                            Minister) feel that Martínez has done a good job and that it would be
                            well to regularize relations with him, none of them feel that, in order
                            to do so, it is worth while to violate as important an instrument for
                            peace as the 1923 treaty. President Ubico, on the other hand, contends
                            that Martínez actually is weaker today than formerly and he insists
                            there is real danger of trouble in Salvador, especially if he is <pb
                                n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0309"/>recognized. In answer to my
                            inquiry as to whether, since he did not favor recognition of Martínez
                            (although willing to accord it), he had any alternative suggestion, the
                            President said that if it were up to him he would leave matters as they
                            are.</p>
                        <p>Of course it is evident that personal and political prejudices have much
                            to do with the Guatemalan attitude; yet I feel certain there exists a
                            real disillusionment over what is considered the sudden and somewhat
                            casual manner in which it is proposed to break the terms of the 1923
                            treaty. It has been pointed out to me both by the President and the
                            Acting Foreign Minister that the United States played a leading part in
                            obtaining acceptance of the treaty and that the course pursued by the
                            various republics with respect to Martínez was mainly due to its strong
                            urging.</p>

                        <p>9. Your 4, January 10, 5 p.m., penultimate paragraph. We strongly doubt
                            the advisability of Mexico City as meeting place. As long as Mexico
                            adheres strictly to the Estrada Doctrine (and there is no indication she
                            will do otherwise) the holding of the Conference in Mexico would be
                            tantamount to abandoning the principle (which the Central American
                            states themselves are understood to be desirous of continuing in
                            workable form) of discouraging revolutionary movements through the
                            non-recognition of Governments coming into power by revolution.
                            Moreover, Ubico’s antipathy for Mexico would raise a difficulty.</p>
                        <p>As regards Panama, if the Central American states should agree on that

                                    stating that he does not consider his plan indicates lack of
                                    correctness and loyalty nor that it implies conditional
                                    recognition of Martínez but rather that it tends to justify step
                                    without releasing parties concerned from terms of treaty.
                                    Telegram adds that Sacasa earnestly hopes that Ubico and he will
                                    adopt a concerted attitude together with Honduras and the

                        <p>10. Your 20, January 19, 8 p.m., and Lawton’s January 19, 1 a.m. In view
                            of apparent impasse reached by Crisanto Sacasa with Ubico please see
                            President Sacasa and say that, in view of this and of the desirability
                            of avoiding development of a situation which might imperil the
                            realization of President Sacasa’s plan, we suggest it would be advisable
                            for President Sacasa to revert to the procedure originally in mind. This
                            procedure, which involves an understanding between the Presidents of
                            Nicaragua, Guatemala and Honduras that pending a revision of the 1923
                            Treaty they will regard it as being in force among each other but not in
                            force with respect to the relations of those three states with Costa
                            Rica and El Salvador, is apparently acceptable to Ubico. For instance,
                            it is noted from Lawton’s January 19, 1 a.m., that Ubico has “no
                            objection” to the foreign ministers of the three states pointing out
                            that the treaty continues in force for their states at the time
                            recognition of El Salvador is announced. Ubico is willing to agree to
                            recognize Martínez and after recognition to join in inviting the five
                            states to a Conference.</p>
                        <p>This procedure would safeguard the essential points of President Sacasa’s
                            proposal, namely, maintenance of the treaty as between the three states
                            and the calling of a conference of the five countries.</p>
                        <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0311"/>
                        <p>Of course the invitation to the Conference could appropriately be issued
                            by the three states (including Honduras) who would reach agreement as to
                            the meeting place.</p>
                        <p>Apparently Ubico’s main difficulty is his unwillingness to join in an
                            agreement signed by Martínez prior to extending recognition to the
                            Martínez regime. It seems to us unwise to press him further on this
                            point.</p>

                            called on the President at 3 p.m., today and discussed with him the

                                    pending before January 25 is very short and negotiation over
                                    some point may cause unexpected further delay.</item>

                        <p>23. In my conversation with the President this afternoon prior to the
                            receipt of the Department’s 10, January 20, 3 p.m., I expressed my
                            personal view, pointing out that I had no authorization from the
                            Department to say so, that Ubico’s objections seemed to me to be merely
                            objections as to the form of the Sacasa plan. … I told him that I
                            thought he could, without sacrificing the principles of his plan, grant
                            concessions to Ubico. … On his agreeing to what I suggested personally,
                            I told him I would submit to him this evening (when he had an engagement
                            to dine with us at the Legation) a draft of a telegram to the
                            Department, I wishing to make certain that I would correctly represent
                            his views.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime the Department’s telegram 10, January 20, 3 p.m.,
                            arrived.</p>
                        <p>Tonight my telegram No. 21, January 20, midnight, was shown to President
                            and Federico Sacasa both of whom said that it represented President’s
                            views and that it was substantially similar to instructions sent to
                            Crisanto Sacasa today.</p>
                        <p>I have emphasized to the Department the point, which may appear
                            insignificant, that Sacasa agreed to accept Ubico’s reported views in
                            principle prior to receipt of suggestions from Department (tonight I
                            acquainted President with views contained in Department’s 10, January
                            20, 3 p.m.). I had in mind that Ubico would be flattered to think that
                            he had compelled Sacasa to accept his point of view and that, on the
                            other hand, Sacasa could feel with truth that he had generously granted
                            concessions to Ubico.</p>

                        <p>24. Having in mind the very limited period of time prior to the proposed
                            date of recognition (January 25), I spoke to the President this morning
                            with a view to’ encouraging acceleration of negotiations. This afternoon
                            the President showed me true reading of telegram sent this afternoon to
                            Crisanto Sacasa in Tegucigalpa urging him that agreement be reached with
                            President Carías today so that Crisanto <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247"

                            the following procedure: <list>

                            in Salvador, it might be better to wait a few days before fixing another

                                Ubico believes that any statement to this effect made previous to or
                                simultaneous with recognition might give impression that recognition
                                was being made contingent upon the calling of a conference to which
                                Ubico was opposed.</p>
                            <p>General Carías sent a telegram yesterday to President Ubico with a
                                view to reconciling differences in methods.</p>
                            <p>Senator Sacasa feels that if date for recognition January 25 is
                                postponed suspicions will be aroused and discussions drawn out for a
                                long time.</p>
                            <p>I suggest that President Sacasa redraft his proposed plan quoted in

                        <p>25. I called on President Sacasa this morning and showed him telegrams of

                                    <ref target="#pg_247">p. 247</ref>.</note> He showed me (1)
                            telegram from President Ubico referred to in Lawton’s January 22, 1
                            p.m., (2) telegram sent by President Sacasa yesterday to Crisanto Sacasa
                            in Tegucigalpa requesting latter to telegraph reaction of Carías as to
                            procedure to be followed in order that telegram of Ubico might be
                            answered, and (3) letter from Crisanto Sacasa dated January 22nd urging
                            that there be no postponement of date of recognition.</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that the telegrams which I had received indicated that
                            Presidents Ubico and Carías are now in agreement with the procedure
                            outlined in President Sacasa’s talk with me on January 20 (as
                            transmitted in my 21, January 20, midnight) but that question of date of
                            recognition appeared to be unsettled. On this point he said that while
                            he would greatly prefer to adhere to date already suggested (January 25)
                            he would be willing to abide by the wishes of Presidents Ubico and
                            Carías. (Crisanto Sacasa in his letter of January 22, strongly urged the
                            President not to permit anyone to influence him to delay
                            recognition.)</p>
                        <p>In the strictest confidence the President showed me a letter dated
                            January 20 from General Martínez thanking him for sending Crisanto
                            Sacasa to Guatemala and stating that recognition would be accorded
                            January 25. In view of this apparent understanding on the part of
                            Martínez, a postponement might be difficult to explain to him.</p>
                        <p>Am repeating above to the Legations at Tegucigalpa and Guatemala with the
                            request that they telegraph me the date agreed upon.</p>

                            returned yesterday from Montevideo informed me this morning that
                            arrangements had been definitely made with Governments of Honduras and
                            Guatemala for recognition by the three Governments of El Salvador

                            of Nicaragua to the principles of treaty of 1923.</p>

                            of Martínez by the three republics tomorrow morning. The Guatemalan
                            Foreign Minister will telegraph the Salvadoran Foreign Minister that
                            recognition is accorded and the Foreign Office will at the same time
                            give out a statement to the press. This last will point out that the
                            1923 treaty has been denounced by Costa Rica and Salvador but that it
                            remains in force for Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. President Ubico
                            himself will make no statement.</p>

                        <p>7. My telegram No. 6, January 24, 4 p.m. President this morning showed me
                            copy of resolution (<hi rend="italic">acuerdo</hi>) issued today in
                            which he announces substantially as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>That in consideration of the fact that it is the obligation of
                                    Central Americanism to facilitate all measures in order that the
                                    five countries of the Isthmus may enjoy the most complete
                                    development of their internal political aspirations and occupy
                                    the international position to which they are entitled, he,
                                    President Carías, resolves to authorize the recognition of
                                    General Martínez and that in view of the treaty of 1923 having
                                    been denounced by Costa Rica and El Salvador and in view of the
                                    fact that it is best for the interests of Honduras to adjust its
                                    relations with the other states which were bound by this treaty,
                                    Carías further resolves to declare the treaty as continuing in
                                    force between Honduras and Nicaragua and Guatemala until a new
                                    convention is agreed upon between the five states of Central
                                    America; the Minister for Foreign Affairs being charged with
                                    making this resolution known to the other interested
                                    parties.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>This resolution will be telegraphed by the Honduran Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Salvador and to Silverio
                            Lainez, Honduran confidential agent in San Salvador, with instructions
                            to the latter to express to General Martínez on behalf of President
                            Carías and Señor Bermudez their sincere conviction that the
                            reestablishment of diplomatic relations will insure a more effective
                            cooperation in favor of their common interests.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: In my letter to you of
                            January 8th last, the Department submitted for your approval a suggested
                            procedure for arriving at the recognition of the present government of
                            El Salvador by the United States. The course as suggested was approved
                            by you.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to say that the negotiations undertaken were carried out
                            successfully and that the Governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and
                            Honduras, as the result of the initiative taken by President Sacasa of
                            Nicaragua, have today accorded formal recognition to the Government of
                            El Salvador. The foreign ministers of the three Governments mentioned
                            have at the same time announced that the provisions of the Treaty of
                            Peace and Amity of 1923 are still binding in so far as their own
                            Governments are concerned. The three Governments have likewise agreed
                            upon, and will in the immediate future make public, an invitation to the
                            Governments of El Salvador and Costa Rica which have denounced the
                            Treaty of 1923 to join with them in a new Central American conference
                            for the purpose of revising the 1923 treaty and of negotiating such
                            other common agreements as may seem desirable.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States has not recognized the Martínez
                            government in El Salvador, as you will recall, because of the fact that
                            so long as the provisions of the Central American Treaty of Peace and
                            Amity of 1923 remained binding upon the Central American governments,
                            the republics of Central America could not themselves extend recognition
                            and it was believed that since the Central American republics had
                            entered into that treaty for the announced purpose of discouraging
                            revolutions in Central America, the Government of the United States
                            should cooperate with them in that effort. Now, however, since the
                            Government of Costa Rica is no longer bound by the provisions of that
                            treaty in view of its denouncement thereof and in view of the
                            announcement by the Governments of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras
                            that the provisions of the treaty are no longer binding upon El Salvador
                            and Costa Rica, and since all of the governments of Central America have
                            accorded official recognition to the Martínez government in El Salvador,
                            there would seem to be every reason why this Government without delay

                            independently in the matter and not conjointly with the three Central

                        <p>30. My 28, January 25, 1 p.m. The President informed me this morning that
                            in his opinion no further steps will be taken in connection <pb n="257"
                                xml:id="pg_257" facs="0323"/>with proposed conference to be held in
                            February until Government of El Salvador is recognized by Government of
                            the United States. As soon as El Salvador is recognized by us he expects
                            that President Ubico will make the move. He said that he personally
                            hopes that conference will be held in “neutral” place and specifically
                            mentioned Panama as desirable, particularly he said because of the
                            possibility that Panama might be included within the terms of the new
                            treaty which it is proposed should be concluded. While he said that the
                            agenda for the proposed conference had not been officially discussed he
                            expressed the belief that the question of the political union of the
                            Central American states (including Panama) might be brought up. He
                            expressed himself as being strongly in favor of such a union because of
                            the economies which could thereby be effected by all the countries and
                            said that the attitude of the United States Government towards such a
                            proposal would have an important effect.</p>

                            for trade between the United States and El Salvador, consideration is
                            being given to the possibility of concluding a mutually advantageous
                            trade agreement between the two countries. Some seventy-five per cent of
                            El Salvador’s exports to the United States consist of coffee. In the
                            proposed agreement, therefore, the United States might undertake that
                            this product should continue to be admitted free of duty in return for
                            reductions in duties by El Salvador on important products of the United
                            States. It is possible that in the course of exploratory conversations
                            El Salvador might wish to bring to the attention of the United States
                            other products, in addition to coffee, on which concessions would be
                            desired. Sympathetic consideration would be given to any such proposals,
                            although it is believed that in view of the importance of coffee in El
                            Salvador’s trade with the United States a guarantee of continued free
                            entry of this product would be equivalent in value to concessions by El
                            Salvador on the principal products imported from the United States.</p>

                        <p>The trade agreement might also contain a provision for unconditional and
                            unrestricted most-favored-nation treatment, subject to the usual
                            exception regarding Cuba, and other generally recognized exceptions;
                            provision against quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports of
                            products respecting which tariff concessions are granted by each party
                            under the agreement; provision against increased internal taxes on such
                            products; and national treatment with respect to internal taxes on all
                            products.</p>
                        <p>Please communicate the above to the Government of El Salvador and inform
                            it that if it is prepared to begin exploratory conversations along the
                            lines above indicated the Department will send you very shortly a
                            statement regarding the concessions which would probably be requested by

                            Salvadoran Government whether it is prepared to initiate exploratory
                            conversations at an early date. Since this Government is planning to

                            other Central American countries it seems appropriate to inquire as a
                            matter of courtesy whether the Salvadoran Government desires a similar
                            announcement to be made with respect to that country.</p>

                        <p>48. Referring to your telegram No. 32, August 30, 7 p.m., sometime ago I
                            made inquiry of the Foreign Minister whether the Salvadoran Government
                            was prepared to initiate exploratory conversations at an early date
                            regarding the possibility of concluding a trade agreement between the
                            two countries. He agreed in principle with the plan but <pb n="259"
                                xml:id="pg_259" facs="0325"/>said he would have to consult the
                            Minister of Finance. Yesterday I received a note from the Foreign
                            Minister in which he stated that the matter had been referred to the
                            Minister of Finance for his consideration and opinion and he would
                            advise me as soon as he had his reply.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office feels that for the present it would appear preferable
                            not to give public notice of the intention to negotiate the agreement
                            with Salvador until after the Finance Minister has had an opportunity to
                            study the matter and give his ideas.</p>

                            No. 48 of August 31, (5 p.m.) in reply to Department’s telegram No. 32
                            of August 30, (7 p.m.) informed the Department that the Foreign Office
                            felt that for the present it would be preferable not to give public
                            notice of intention to negotiate an agreement with El Salvador until
                            after the Finance Minister had had an opportunity to study the subject.
                            Apparently overlooking the information furnished in this telegram,
                            announcement was made that El Salvador had agreed to undertake
                            conversations looking to a trade agreement. Inasmuch as this publication
                            appeared simultaneously with like publications regarding other Latin
                            American countries, it produced no reaction here. El Salvador therefore
                            is not yet in the position of having expressed a desire to negotiate a
                            commercial agreement.<note n="40" xml:id="d267fn3">For information that
                                El Salvador was ready to enter into conversations regarding a new

                        <p>This cotton tariff law is purely nationalistic in its motivation and does
                            not represent an attempt to raise a duty before starting to negotiate a

                            which would not be a concession in fact but a return to <hi

                        <p>I have already called the attention of the Minister of Foreign Relations
                            to the fact that this legislation was directly contrary to the attempt
                            now being made to break down trade barriers. The Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs agreed with my opinion, but expressed inability to do anything
                            about this law which had been passed by the Legislative Assembly to
                            encourage cotton growing in the country.</p>
                        <p>Considering the above facts, does the Department still desire me to <pb

                            despatch No. 93 of November 2, 1934, in regard to a recent increase in
                            the tariff on cotton imported into El Salvador.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the first paragraph on page 2 of your despatch, wherein
                            it is stated that in giving public notice of intention to negotiate a
                            trade agreement with El Salvador the Department apparently overlooked
                            information furnished by you to the effect that the Salvadoran Foreign
                            Office felt that for the time being it would be preferable not to give
                            such notice, you are informed that before the public notice was given
                            the Minister of El Salvador, in conversation with Assistant Secretary
                            Welles, stated that he had been instructed by his Government to state
                            that the Government of El Salvador desired to negotiate a trade
                            agreement with the United States. Upon being told by Mr. Welles that
                            public notice of the negotiation would be given simultaneously with
                            notices regarding negotiations with the other Central American
                            republics, the Minister said that he appreciated this courtesy on the
                            part of the Department and was entirely in accord with the public notice
                            being given.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above, the Department is of the opinion that its attitude
                            with respect to the raising of tariff rates at the present time on
                            commodities imported principally from the United States, as set forth in
                            its instruction No. 42 of October 26, 1934, is well taken. It is
                            suggested, therefore, that, unless you perceive objections other than
                            those raised in your despatch under acknowledgment, you bring the
                            Department’s view of the increase in tariff on imported cotton
                            informally to the attention of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

                        <p>Mr. J. Lawrence Gilson, Chairman of the Bondholders Protective Committee
                            for the External Bonds of the Republic of El Salvador, called on Mr.
                            Welles; Mr. Wilson was present. Mr. Gilson stated that his Committee was
                            concerned over the failure of Salvador to make any remittances so far
                            this year under the temporary agreement for servicing the bonds. He said
                            that the Committee expected that nothing would be received for the next
                            few months and that by next May, when the payment on the coupons was
                            due, no funds would be available.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gilson said that he had carried on considerable correspondence with
                            President Martínez and the Finance Minister of Salvador. The Salvadoran
                            Government took the position that in view of the “trend of the times”,
                            lack of funds on the part of the Government, onerous provisions of the
                            loan contract, et cetera, interest on the bonds should be cut about
                            fifty per cent. In this connection Mr. Gilson referred to an
                            “understanding” reached by the Government of Salvador with the bankers
                            at the time the loan was floated that if the Republic carried out its
                            obligations under the contract over a period of eight or ten years, the
                            bankers would endeavor to refund the outstanding balance and have the
                            interest rate reduced. (So far as I know this is the first we have heard
                            of such an “understanding”, and as Salvador met her obligations from the
                            time of the loan in 1922 down to February 1932, it may be that President
                            Martínez is seeking some relief on the basis of this arrangement.)</p>
                        <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0333"/>
                        <p>Mr. Gilson referred to the defaults which took place in February 1932 and
                            said that he considered the Department’s position as “entirely correct”
                            in declining to take up with Salvador, as provided in the loan contract,
                            the question of a collectorship of customs, in view of the fact that
                            there was no recognized government to deal with. Mr. Gilson referred to
                            the fact that the situation was perhaps different now that we had
                            recognized the Martínez government, but he made no request for any
                            action looking to the establishment of a collectorship; on the contrary,
                            he said that in his view he did not think it necessary to have a customs
                            collectorship installed in Salvador since the Government had ample funds
                            to pay on the basis of the present temporary agreement, and the
                            bondholders would be willing to agree to an extension of this temporary
                            agreement on reasonable terms. Mr. Gilson said that the purpose of his
                            visit was to request the Department to instruct Dr. Corrigan, the new
                            Minister, to say to the Salvadoran Government on his arrival that we
                            felt that Salvador should continue its payments under the terms of the
                            temporary agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles said that this was the first information we had received that
                            the remittances were not being made currently under the temporary
                            arrangement. He said that we would instruct the Chargé d’Affaires at San
                            Salvador to look into the situation and give us full information. Mr.
                            Gilson said that he would be glad to send a memorandum to the Department
                            giving all the information which his Committee possessed, and which we
                            could send to the Chargé d’Affaires for his information. Mr. Welles
                            suggested that Mr. Gilson get in touch with the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council, since this Salvadoran situation would fall within
                            the field of the Council. Mr. Gilson said that his Committee was a going
                            concern, that it had taken effective action in behalf of the holders of
                            Salvadoran bonds, and that he was not sure there was anything the
                            Foreign Bondholders Protective Council could do in the matter, but that
                            he would be glad to get in touch with that organization and talk over
                            the situation.</p>
                        <p>During the conversation Mr. Gilson mentioned that the Committee had had
                            some difficulties with the Salvadoran Government over the question of
                            payment of the expenses of the Committee, particularly legal expenses,
                            which Mr. Gilson said had been heavy. The Salvadoran Government had
                            refused to contribute to the Committee’s expenses, which necessarily had
                            become a chargé on the bondholders. Mr. Gilson said the bondholders had
                            “agreed” that 15% of the coupons should be deducted for the Committee’s
                            expenses; he mentioned that the members of the Committee received
                            remuneration in the sum of $3,000 annually each.</p>

                            that funds which should accrue to the bondholders are being diverted by
                            the Republic for purposes directly contrary to the terms of the Loan
                            Contract.</p>
                        <p>I will appreciate very much your consideration of this matter and would
                            respectfully suggest that the Department of State is now in a position
                            where it can be of material assistance to a large number of citizens of
                            this country who are owners of these bonds and are dependent upon them
                            for a large part of their income.</p>
                        <p>Should you desire more copies of this Memorandum I will be very glad to
                            forward them to you at any time.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Gilson called to see me two days ago and in his conversation said
                            that he felt it was desirable not to suggest any change in the existing
                            arrangement between the Government of Salvador and the bondholders until
                            after the next Presidential elections had taken place. I said that, in
                            general, I concurred in his opinion, but stated that I did not wish to
                            make any definite statement in the matter until after receipt of the
                            requested report from the American Legation in San Salvador. I further
                            said that I would let him know when the report had been received and

                        <p>Mr. J. Lawrence Gilson, Chairman of the Bondholders Protective Committee
                            for the External Bonds of the Republic of Salvador, telephoned me from
                            New York. He referred to his recent conversation with Mr. Welles, and
                            said that day before yesterday he had received a cable from the Finance
                            Minister of Salvador reading in translation as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Government resolved to pay coupon up to June. We request

                        <p>Mr. Gilson said that it appeared that President Martínez wanted to reduce
                            the bond interest by about 50%, and that this was evidently a move to
                            initiate discussions with this object in view. He said that the attitude
                            of the Committee had been to do nothing to disturb the present
                            arrangement, to endeavor to extend the present arrangement for another
                            year and then, following the election and inauguration of a new
                            President early in 1935, to take up the matter of a revision of the 1922
                            loan contract on an equitable basis. He said that the Committee had not
                            yet replied to the recent cable from the Finance Minister and did not
                            wish to do so until it had an expression of our views in the matter.</p>
                        <p>I said that I did not see how we could advise his Committee as to the
                            attitude it should take in this matter. I said that once the Committee
                            had determined upon the course of action it thought well to pursue we
                            would of course be interested in being advised thereof. Mr. Gilson then
                            said that the Committee would take the matter under consideration and
                            would write us a letter indicating what it proposed to do and probably
                            inquiring whether we had any comments to make.<note n="53"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 165 of April 11, 1934 and No. 28 of August
                            30, 1934,<note n="54" xml:id="d276fn1">Instruction No. 28 not
                                printed.</note> and to report that this study was begun immediately
                            upon my arrival here. I had before sailing from New York a conference
                            with Mr. Gilson the Chairman of the Bondholders Protective Committee,
                            who gave me a complete summary of the salient facts in connection with
                            the history of the loan and its present status. I have been in close
                            touch with Mr. William Renwick, Fiscal Agent for the Loan, and have had
                            several conferences with him and members of his staff. Mr. Renwick
                            brought in Mr. John Armstrong, representing the British Bondholders,
                            last month and the matter was also discussed from their point of
                            view.</p>
                        <p>With particular reference to Mr. Gilson’s contention “that the Republic
                            of El Salvador is financially able to meet its external obligations” but
                            “that funds which should accrue to the bondholders are being diverted by
                            the Republic for purposes directly contrary to the terms of the Loan
                            Contract” I beg to report that the first part of Mr. Gilson’s contention
                            is probably true. The second part “that funds which should <pb n="271"
                                xml:id="pg_271" facs="0337"/>accrue to the bondholders are being
                            diverted by the Republic for purposes directly contrary to the terms of
                            the Loan Contract” is open to question and has an important bearing on
                            the first. About twenty-five per cent of the total revenue is devoted to
                            the military expense, maintenance of National Guard and Police. Under
                            the circumstances now obtaining and for a time at least a large part of
                            this expenditure might fairly be charged against the maintenance of
                            public order. There is a strong undercurrent of unrest fomented by
                            communistic indoctrination which would become immediately manifest at
                            any sign of weakness in the government either moral or physical. The
                            authorities here recognize this quiescent but powerful opposition and it
                            is their first consideration. Therefore, a considerable portion of this
                            expenditure might be justified even from the bondholders point of view
                            because a successful subversive movement would certainly imperil their
                            investment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Renwick and Mr. Armstrong both agree with me that the first
                            consideration is that the face value of these bonds be safeguarded and
                            the conservation of their validity as an obligation of this Salvadoran
                            government be maintained so that the investors may sometime get back
                            their principal.</p>
                        <p>The actual facts that confront the bondholders is not what the Republic
                            of El Salvador is financially able to do under normal circumstances but
                            what the Government of El Salvador will do under the special set of
                            circumstances which govern. In this connection the position of the
                            Department is important.</p>
                        <p>In order that the Department may be informed as to all phases of the
                            Salvadoran Government’s attitude, I relate a conversation with … He told
                            me that this as well as other Latin-American governments are inclined to
                            construe the “good neighbor” policy into a license to do as they please
                            with regard to financial obligations owed to foreigners. He cynically
                            observed that the only reason that they had respected their obligations
                            formerly was through fear of the State Department and that this fear was
                            now removed. I felt that he over-drew the picture but I was compelled to
                            give some weight to his opinion because it is confirmed in some degree
                            by Mr. Renwick’s reports to me of his visits with the Minister of
                            Hacienda. His mental attitude, according to this informant, is not such
                            as to inspire a feeling of confidence that he wants to make a bona-fide
                            effort to do all that is reasonably possible under the Loan Contract. It
                            is characterized rather by an effort to postpone or evade its
                            fullfillment.</p>
                        <p>With reference to such an attitude I told Mr. Renwick that the “good
                            neighbor” policy did not imply lack of interest in the rights and
                            interests of our citizens but only the belief that moral pressure was
                            superior to physical force in protecting those interests. I was careful
                                <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0338"/>to keep within the meaning
                            of public statements which have been made by the Secretary on these
                            points in order to remain in line with the Department’s policy.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of Hacienda is demanding a flat fifty per cent reduction in
                            interest rate on the A, B and C bonds with no amortization for two or
                            three years. “B” bonds are the British owned issue. Mr. Renwick informs
                            me that there is a wide difference between the “A” and “C” bonds which
                            might warrant separate treatment on the part of the government. The
                            holders of the “A” bonds invested actual money in good faith and are
                            entitled to the most favorable treatment possible. The “B” bonds were
                            issued against claims many of them exaggerated or of doubtful validity.
                            The Salvadoran Government did not receive anything like one hundred per
                            cent value for these bonds and might justly request a readjustment as
                            regards this issue. Of course most of them were sold by the original
                            holders and are now in the hands of people who bought them in good
                            faith. All issues are now in default and I fear will remain so until a
                            new agreement is reached. The Minister of Hacienda is not disposed to
                            renew the temporary agreement. He wishes to proceed at once to a
                            reconsideration of the 1922 contract and a new deal. Mr. Renwick would
                            like to have these conversations take place in Washington. All that I
                            have said here about the position of the Minister of Hacienda is from
                            information furnished me by the Fiscal Representative or members of his
                            staff.</p>
                        <p>The position taken by the Legation in these conversations is comprised in
                            and did not go beyond what I have expressed in a letter on the subject
                            addressed to Mr. Renwick, copy of which is appended.<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d276fn2">Not printed.</note> I sent this letter in order
                            that Mr. Renwick might make what use he could of the fact that he had a
                            communication from me which would indicate that the watchful interest
                            and moral forces of the Government are still active in protecting and
                            aiding American interests.</p>
                        <p>I am enclosing with this despatch a memorandum from Mr. William
                                Renwick<note n="55" xml:id="d276fn3">Not printed.</note> giving his
                            view point of the present status of the loan negotiations.</p>

                        <p>Mr. F. J. Lisman, of the Bondholders Protective Committee for Republic of
                            El Salvador External Bonds, called on Mr. Welles. He stated that Mr.
                            Gilson, Chairman of the Committee, had died about <pb n="273"
                                xml:id="pg_273" facs="0339"/>ten days ago, following a rather
                            prolonged illness; that the Committee had elected a Mr. Lowber, Trust
                            Officer of the Manufacturers’ Trust Company, to succeed Mr. Gilson as a
                            member of the Committee. It has not yet been decided, according to Mr.
                            Lisman, whether the Chairman of the Committee will be Mr. Lavis or Mr.
                            Lisman.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lisman said that the Committee was receiving remittances regularly,
                            and that the money was now in the bank to pay interest on the A and B
                            bonds due January 1, 1935. In this connection he left the attached
                            letter from Mr. Bradford, Secretary of the Committee,<note n="56"
                                xml:id="d277fn1">Not printed.</note> setting out the increase in
                            customs revenues for July and August over the respective months of last
                            year. Mr. Lisman said that since last March the Committee had been
                            endeavoring to obtain a reply from the Salvadoran Finance Minister on
                            the Committee’s proposal that the existing temporary agreement should be
                            extended to be in effect during the calendar year 1935. He said that the
                            Finance Minister had sent mere acknowledgments but had expressed no
                            views on the proposal. The time is now getting short, and the Committee
                            hopes to avoid the unpleasant situation which would result if by January
                            1, 1935, when the present agreement expires, there has been no agreement
                            negotiated to cover the immediate future. He said that the Committee
                            felt that it would be impossible to negotiate a permanent arrangement
                            before January 1, 1935, and that in any case it would be preferable to
                            extend the temporary agreement so as to afford sufficient time to
                            negotiate the permanent agreement after the new administration comes
                            into office in Salvador next March. In this connection Mr. Lisman handed
                            Mr. Welles the attached copy of a letter which the Committee proposes to
                            send to the Finance Minister.<note n="56" xml:id="d277fn2">Not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. Welles said that this was in effect the position indicated by Mr.
                            Gilson some time ago. He said that it was obviously in the best
                            interests of all concerned to avoid an embarrassing situation next
                            January. He said that in view of the efforts made by the Bondholders
                            Committee since last March to obtain some indication of the opinion of
                            the Salvadoran Government on the proposal for an extension of the
                            temporary agreement, he would be prepared to send an instruction to Dr.
                            Corrigan to inquire, orally and informally, what the intentions of the
                            Salvadoran Government were in the matter. He said that he felt this was
                            all that the Department could do under existing circumstances. Mr.
                            Lisman said that he would appreciate this action very much and thought
                            it would be decidedly helpful.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lisman added, in the course of the conversation, that the Committee
                            hoped the negotiations for the extension of the agreement might take
                            place with the Salvadoran Minister in Washington; otherwise <pb n="274"
                                xml:id="pg_274" facs="0340"/>the Committee would have to send
                            someone to Salvador as it had been very careful to keep Mr. Renwick out
                            of any of these negotiations, feeling that otherwise his cordial
                            relations with the Salvadoran Government might be prejudiced.</p>

                            was transmitted a copy of a memorandum of a conversation held on October

                            and in consideration of the present internal political situation with a
                            presidential campaign in progress, probably the most feasible thing
                            would be an extension of the present temporary contract. He further
                            informed me that he would discuss that matter with the President and
                            also with the Minister of Finance and would let me know their views

                        <p>Mr. F. J. Lisman and Mr. Fred Lavis, of the Bondholders Protective
                            Committee for El Salvador Bonds, called on Mr. Welles. Mr. Wilson was
                            present. Mr. Lisman referred to a telephone conversation he had had with
                            Mr. Wilson on November 13, (see memo, of that date)<note n="60"
                                xml:id="d280fn60">Not printed.</note> said that the Committee had
                            held its meeting on November 16, and that as yet no reply had come from
                            the Salvadoran Finance Minister to the Committee’s letter of last
                            October.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lavis said that reports from Mr. Renwick were to the effect that the
                            Salvadoran Finance Minister maintained that Salvador could not continue,
                            in an extension of the present temporary agreement, to make the same
                            interest payments, and that some reduction in interest would have to be
                            effected. The Minister’s reason for this was the difficulty Salvador was
                            meeting in marketing its coffee crop, due to restrictions on imports in
                            Germany. Mr. Renwick had advised Mr. Lavis that in his own opinion it
                            would probably be impossible for Salvador, because of the coffee
                            difficulties, to continue the present interest rates; Mr. Lavis,
                            however, stated that he doubted whether this represented a considered
                            view on Mr. Renwick’s part …</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lavis said that he felt the Salvadoran Finance Minister was probably
                            confusing two matters: one, his natural desire to obtain a reduction in
                            interest on any definitive settlement; and, two, the matter of a mere
                            extension for one year of the existing temporary arrangement. Mr. Lavis
                            said that the members of the Committee felt that they owed it to the
                            bondholders to do everything possible to obtain an extension of the
                            present temporary arrangement for one year in <pb n="276"
                                xml:id="pg_276" facs="0342"/>order to have an opportunity to work
                            out with the new Administration, which would come into office next
                            March, a definitive settlement. The Committee had, therefore, determined
                            to send a representative to Salvador to discuss the matter with the
                            Government, and Mr. Lavis would be the representative; he plans to leave
                            by Grace Line steamer on November 24.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lavis said that he would not desire to go to Salvador if there was
                            any objection on the part of the Department. Mr. Welles said that, on
                            the contrary, he thought it was a wise move and that Mr. Lavis’s visit
                            should be of assistance to the bondholders. Mr. Lavis then said that he
                            hoped he could count upon the support of Dr. Corrigan in his
                            negotiations. Mr. Welles said that, as Mr. Lavis knows, Dr. Corrigan was
                            fully informed in the matter and had recently expressed interest to the
                            Foreign Minister in this matter through his inquiry as to the views of
                            the Salvadoran Government on the Committee’s proposal for an extension
                            of the present agreement. Mr. Welles said that, while he was sure Dr.
                            Corrigan would be glad to discuss the situation fully with Mr. Lavis, he
                            thought it would be unwise for Dr. Corrigan to associate himself with
                            Mr. Lavis in any way in the latter’s negotiations, or to accompany him
                            in his visits to the Salvadoran authorities. Mr. Lavis stated that he
                            shared this view.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that Doctor
                            Miguel Araujo, Minister for Foreign Affairs, called on me this afternoon
                            and reported the action of the Council of Ministers on the two questions
                            I had discussed with him informally earlier in the week.</p>
                        <p>First, he stated that his Government was now ready to enter into
                            conversations with reference to a new Trade Agreement with the United
                                States.<note n="62" xml:id="d282fn62">For correspondence concerning
                                the trade agreement, see <ref target="#pg_257">pp. 257</ref>
                                ff.</note></p>
                        <p>Second, in answer to my question with reference to an agreement on the
                            Foreign Loan Contract, (Department’s instruction No. 39 of October 19,
                            1934) he said that inasmuch as a representative of the Bondholders
                            Protective Committee was coming to Salvador early in December,
                            (Department’s instruction No. 47 of November 22, 1934) the Council of
                            Ministers has decided that they would like to conclude an entirely new
                            and permanent agreement while he is here instead of extending the
                            present temporary arrangement and that they would like to have my
                            assistance in working out this new agreement.</p>
                        <p>I informed him that it was not a matter in which my Government was
                            directly concerned but because citizens of the United States were
                            holders of the bonds we would like to see their interests protected. In
                            view of this, I told him that the negotiations should be carried on
                            between his Government and the Bondholders representative and that I
                            would remain outside. On his insistence that I lend my aid to the
                            discussion, I assured him in very general terms that I was always ready
                            to be helpful in any way possible and that my informal opinions would
                            always be available.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I may say that this Government had practically agreed to
                            extend the present temporary agreement for a year with the idea of
                            postponing the discussions until after the inauguration of the new
                            administration in March but the arrival of Mr. Lavis has caused them to
                            change their minds.</p>

                            November 30, <pb n="278" xml:id="pg_278" facs="0344"/>1934, I have the
                            honor to report that Mr. Fred Lavis called on me on December 4th to
                            inform me of his arrival. He stated that he held power of attorney from
                            the Bondholders Protective Committee for El Salvador bonds. He informed
                            me of his intention to begin negotiations with Salvadoran Government
                            either to extend the present temporary agreement which expires December
                            31, 1934 or to make a new agreement for payment of service on the loan.
                            I discussed the situation with him as directed by the Department and
                            gave him the benefit of the Legation’s information in the matter. Mr.
                            Lavis called frequently after that and kept the Legation informed as to
                            the status of his negotiations. He told me that Mr. Armstrong
                            representing the British Bondholders had come over from Guatemala to aid
                            him in the negotiations. He also furnished copies of his correspondence
                            with the Government, which copies are on file in the Legation.</p>
                        <p>On Monday December 17th Mr. Lavis called on me to inform me that his
                            various conversations with the Minister of Hacienda of El Salvador had
                            produced no results, and that Mr. Armstrong had gone back to Guatemala
                            leaving in his hands the representation of the British interests. He had
                            made various propositions none of which had been either accepted or
                            refused. He stated that he was leaving by Grace Line Steamer on Saturday
                            December 22nd without having accomplished his objective. I told him I
                            would consider whether another informal approach by me to Minister
                            Araujo could be of any help and if I decided that it might, I would call
                            upon him. After careful consideration I felt that another call upon the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs would be compatible with the Department’s
                            instruction No. 39 of October 19, 1934.</p>
                        <p>The following morning I made an appointment with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, Doctor Araujo. When I arrived for the interview Subsecretary
                            Doctor Arturo Avila was also present. I emphasized the fact that my
                            visit was a friendly one and in no sense official but I felt that it
                            might be worthwhile to discuss some features of the failure to reach an
                            agreement about the loan contract. I pointed out the undesirability of
                            the publicity that would undoubtedly be given to Mr. Lavis’ failure to
                            reach an understanding and the prejudicial effect that it would have
                            upon Salvadoran credit.</p>
                        <p>I discussed some provisions of the offer which Mr. Lavis had indicated
                            would be satisfactory and pointed out the advantages which might accrue
                            to Salvador by taking advantage of them.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Araujo then asked me if I would mind going with them to the
                            President so that they might put the matter before him in the same
                            light. I consented, insisting upon the entirely informal and unofficial
                            status of our visit. The matter was then laid before President Menendez
                                [<hi rend="italic">Martínez</hi>] by Doctor Araujo in substantially
                                <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0345"/>the manner detailed above.
                            The President listened and without making any commitments said that he
                            would call in the Minister of Hacienda and take the matter up with
                            him.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Araujo and Doctor Avila both assured me after we left the
                            President that they were quite sure that the matter would be
                            arranged.</p>
                        <p>The following morning the Minister of Hacienda, Doctor Menendez Castro,
                            called upon me at the Legation and gave me a long explanation of his
                            position, the great losses from the recent hurricane, the necessity for
                            heavy expenditures in the interest of public order, etc. I expressed my
                            regrets at his failure or inability to reach an agreement with Mr. Lavis
                            and tried to turn his mind toward the advantage that would accrue to
                            Salvadoran credit by coming to an understanding with Mr. Lavis, now
                            representing both British and American Bondholders.</p>
                        <p>I apprised Mr. Lavis and Mr. Renwick, the local representative of the
                            loan, of these informal conversations with Government officials. They
                            then decided to re-open negotiations in the hope that Mr. Lavis would
                            not have to go home without having reached an agreement.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased to report that the later negotiations were successful. Mr.
                            Lavis called at the Legation this morning on his way to the boat and
                            informed me that after considerable discussion and some minor changes
                            the final draft of an agreement between the Government and himself for
                            the Bondholders Protective Committee was signed this morning.</p>
                        <p>The new agreement is also temporary. It provides for a complete
                            discussion of the entire Contract beginning in March of 1935. It also
                            states that a concession in interest rates will be part of the new
                            agreement and that its provision will be retroactive and effective from
                            December 31, 1934, the date of expiration of the present agreement. A
                            copy and translation will be forwarded by next airmail.<note n="63"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to your despatch 1024,
                            September 9, and the Department’s instruction 303, September 26,
                                1933,<note n="1" xml:id="d284fn1">Neither printed.</note> regarding
                            the desire of Guatemala to open conversations with the United States
                            with a view to concluding a commercial treaty.</p>
                        <p>This Government is now prepared to enter into exploratory conversations
                            regarding the possibility of negotiating a reciprocal trade agreement.
                            The Department desires that these conversations take place at Guatemala
                            and accordingly you are requested to take up the matter with the
                            Minister of Foreign Affairs. You may suggest to him that these
                            conversations might proceed on the following basis:</p>
                        <p>Since over 90 percent of the imports into the United States from
                            Guatemala consist of coffee and bananas, which are admitted free of
                            duty, the agreement might fairly provide that this Government would
                            continue to accord free entry to these products in return for
                            concessions by Guatemala on products imported from the United States. It
                            is possible that in the course of the exploratory conversations
                            Guatemala may wish to bring to the attention of the United States other
                            products in addition to bananas and coffee on which concessions would be
                            desired. While sympathetic consideration would be given to any such
                            proposals, it is believed that in view of the importance of coffee and
                            bananas in Guatemala’s trade with the United States a guaranty of
                            continued free entry of these products would be equivalent in value to
                            concessions by Guatemala on the principal products imported from the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Foreign Minister’s suggestion regarding sugar this
                            Government is not at this time in a position to indicate whether any
                            provision could be made regarding the treatment of this product. In
                            regard to his suggestion concerning a loan or credit facilities as a <hi
                                rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> by the United States, this
                            Government could not entertain any proposals of this kind.</p>
                        <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0347"/>
                        <p>In addition to provisions of the character indicated above, the trade
                            agreement might provide for unconditional and unrestricted most favored
                            nation treatment, subject to the usual exception regarding Cuba, and
                            other generally recognized exceptions; provision against quantitative
                            restrictions (quotas) on imports of products respecting which tariff
                            concessions are granted by each party under the agreement; provision
                            against increased internal taxes on such products; and national
                            treatment with respect to internal taxes on all products.</p>
                        <p>If the Foreign Minister is prepared to begin exploratory conversations
                            along the general lines indicated the Department will send you as soon
                            as possible a statement regarding the concessions which would probably
                            be requested by the United States.</p>
                        <p>You should make it perfectly clear that the intention of this Government
                            is solely to explore the situation to determine whether negotiations, if
                            undertaken, would be likely to meet with success.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s airmail instruction No. 9 of January 4, 1934
                            (received January 15th subsequent to the receipt of the confirmation
                            copy by regular pouch) regarding the possible opening of conversations
                            between the United States and Guatemala with a view to concluding a
                            commercial treaty. I took up the question of the possibility of opening
                            such conversations with the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
                            stated that he would be glad to go into the matter further upon the
                            receipt of a memorandum listing the concessions which would probably be
                            requested by the United States side by side with those which might be
                            offered to Guatemala. He added that in his opinion President Ubico would
                            be interested in the possibility of a commercial treaty, but that he
                            preferred not to take the matter up with the President until he could
                            present him a memorandum along the lines indicated. I conveyed to him
                            the Department’s suggestions as to the basis on which the conversations
                            could proceed; and he indicated his interest in the concessions which
                            might be proposed by the United States for Guatemalan products. He
                            mentioned particularly his Government’s interest in possible better
                            treatment on sugar; but I explained that the United States Government
                            was not at this time in a position to indicate whether any provision
                            could be made as to that product. In any case, the Minister preferred
                            not to express any definite opinion <pb n="282" xml:id="pg_282"
                                facs="0348"/>as to the specific suggestions, since he is anxious
                            first to know what concessions would be requested by the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>I assured Licenciado Saenz de Tejada that I would communicate at once
                            with the Department, and that I hoped in a short time to be able to
                            provide him with a statement such as he desired.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the
                            Department’s instruction No. 9 of January 4, 1934, and the Legation’s
                            despatch No. 52 of January 16, 1934, with reference to the opening of
                            conversations with the Government of Guatemala, having in mind the
                            possible conclusion of a commercial treaty, as well as the Legation’s
                            despatch No. 232 of June 27, 1934,<note n="2" xml:id="d286fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> in connection with the imposition of a German quota
                            on imports of Guatemalan coffee.</p>
                        <p>I have just been informed by Licenciado Skinner Klee, Guatemalan Foreign
                            Minister, that in addition to the concern which the Government is
                            feeling with regard to the threatened imposition of a German quota it
                            has just been learned that France has placed a quota on banana imports
                            and has fixed the amount at approximately five thousand tons for the
                            last half of the present calendar year. This amount is about one ship
                            load for the larger vessels of the United Fruit Company. Further, since
                            the restriction provides that the entire quota may be taken at any one
                            time, Dr. Skinner Klee felt that the shipment would in all probability
                            be made from Santa Marta in Colombia and this would mean no further
                            banana sales for Guatemala to France. However, since such exports have
                            previously been slight and the greater part of the income therefrom
                            derives to the United Fruit Company, it would appear that the Foreign
                            Minister is needlessly worried.</p>
                        <p>The developments reported by Dr. Skinner Klee have increased the desire
                            of his Government to negotiate a trade arrangement with the United
                            States which would open up a broader market for Guatemalan products,
                            especially for a larger percentage of Guatemalan coffee which has
                            heretofore been shipped to Germany. In a number of conversations which I
                            have had recently with the Minister for Foreign Affairs he has
                            manifested his interest as well as his anxiety in this connection. He
                            appears to be a strong advocate for the increase <pb n="283"
                                xml:id="pg_283" facs="0349"/>of trade between Guatemala and the
                            United States even to the extent of making the latter the exclusive
                            market for Guatemalan sales. Should this eventuate he advocates greatly
                            increased imports from the United States to the extent of making us the
                            sole source of supply for such products as we are able to furnish.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Skinner Klee brought up the subject again only this morning, when I
                            called upon him in connection with another matter, and told me that he
                            proposed to request formal authority of President Ubico to enter into
                            negotiations for a trade agreement with the United States which might
                            accomplish what he has in mind. It was not indicated, however, whether,
                            in preliminary conversation with regard thereto, the Guatemalan
                            Government would endeavor to insist upon a preferential rate on sugar
                            exports, as was indicated in the Legation’s despatch first
                            mentioned.</p>

                        <p>24. Department’s instruction No. 9, January 4, 1934. The Department
                            wishes to commence exploratory conversations as soon as possible. It is
                            therefore preparing a study of the trade between the two countries and a
                            list of the concessions which would probably be asked of Guatemala. This
                            list will be forwarded to you shortly. It is hoped that Guatemala in
                            turn will be in a position to expedite its own study in order that
                            actual conversations can be initiated in Guatemala not later than
                            September 1. Please ascertain and report whether this is agreeable to
                            the Government of Guatemala. It is desired that no publicity be given
                            matter for time being.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Department’s
                            telegram No. 24 of July 17 expressing its desire to begin exploratory
                            conversations with regard to the conclusion of a reciprocal trade
                            agreement between the United States and Guatemala, I have the honor to
                            report that the Minister for Foreign Affairs in conversation with me
                            this morning confirmed my previous impression reported in my telegram
                            No. 47 of July 18, 10 a.m., and my despatch No. 247 of July 16, 1934,
                            that it would be agreeable to this Government to begin such
                            conversations.</p>
                        <p>I informed Licenciado Skinner Klee of the Department’s readiness to enter
                            into exploratory conversations and its desire that they should commence
                            not later than September 1st. The Minister expressed himself as being
                            heartily in favor of opening such conversations and informed me that he
                            is only waiting some more definite advice concerning the real intentions
                            of Germany relative to the threatened imposition of a coffee quota
                            before committing his Government to a definite date for the opening of
                            conversations. He added, however, that in all probability September 1st
                            would be a satisfactory date.</p>
                        <p>In the course of our conversation, Dr. Skinner Klee stated that he felt
                            that regardless of the difficulties which had arisen recently with
                            Germany and France as well as other trade complications to the
                            disadvantage of Guatemala, he was strongly of the opinion that Guatemala
                            should have a special trade agreement with the United States which would
                            intensify their commerce and especially give to Guatemala a larger
                            market for its products in the United States. He said that Guatemalan
                            imports from Japan were now at the rate of approximately $70,000 per
                            month and that Japan purchased practically nothing of Guatemala. He said
                            this was a condition which should not be permitted to continue
                            indefinitely. He added that the merchandise being imported from Japan is
                            of decidedly inferior quality but that it would take Guatemalan
                            consumers sometime to learn this and that the absurdly low prices for
                            this merchandise are a tremendous inducement to the purchaser.</p>
                        <p>The Minister then went on to observe that Guatemalan coffee, bananas and
                            chicle enter the United States free of duty and he seemed to think that
                            there is not much probability that a duty will be imposed on them. At
                            the same time he appeared to recognize that an assurance that these
                            products would continue to enter the American market free of duty would
                            furnish a guarantee for the future which would be of value to Guatemala.
                            I told him that it is to be presumed <pb n="285" xml:id="pg_285"
                                facs="0351"/>that my Government would endeavor to negotiate trade
                            agreements with the other Latin American countries and that, although it
                            may not be probable, it is possible that circumstances would arise in
                            such negotiations which would make it desirable for my Government to
                            offer special inducements to some other coffee producing country for the
                            importation of its coffee into the United States. I told him that I was
                            saying this without any information from my Government to that effect,
                            and that I was sure he would understand that I was not implying anything
                            in the nature of a threat but was merely pointing out a common sense
                            view of the matter which Guatemala should not overlook. I told him that
                            I felt confident that it is the desire of my Government, and that
                            certainly it is my own, that any special trade arrangement with
                            Guatemala should be for the mutual benefit of both countries, and that
                            he could count on our effort to make the arrangement of benefit to
                            Guatemala.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the foregoing Dr. Skinner Klee told me that Dr.
                                López<note n="3" xml:id="d289fn3">President of Colombia.</note> when
                            here had not seemed to be pleased with the proposed trade arrangement
                            between the United States and Colombia<note n="4" xml:id="d289fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#pg_66">pp. 66</ref> ff.</note> and had expressed
                            doubt as to whether it would be acceptable to his Government when it is
                            inaugurated.</p>
                        <p>The Minister, as on former occasions recently, expressed himself as being
                            unqualifiedly of the opinion that a special trade agreement should be
                            and can be made between Guatemala and the United States which would be
                            to their mutual advantage. As heretofore, he expressed himself as
                            strongly of the opinion that Guatemala should broaden the market for its
                            products in the United States and should purchase a greater percentage
                            of its importations in the market of the United States.</p>

                        <p>51. My despatch No. 258, July 24. Minister for Foreign Affairs told me
                            this morning that under existing circumstances he could hardly expect in
                            near future a definition of Germany’s attitude on trade matters with
                            Guatemala but that regardless of Germany’s attitude his Government
                            expects to give consideration to any proposals the Government of the
                            United States might care to make when the prospective conversations are
                            opened about September 1st.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my recent despatches in
                            connection with the proposed commercial agreement between the United
                            States and Guatemala, I have the honor to report that in conversation
                            with the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning he mentioned the
                            following matter to me.</p>
                        <p>He stated that a concession which the United States might make and which
                            would be of material benefit to Guatemala would be to impose a <pb
                                n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0353"/>duty on chicle imported into
                            the United States, and then exempt Guatemala from the payment of the
                            duty. Dr. Skinner Klee said this arrangement would tend to correct the
                            contraband traffic in chicle originating in Guatemala and exported to
                            the United Spates through Belize and Mexico as being of origin in
                            British Honduras and Mexican territory. He was of the opinion that
                            thirty thousand quintals yearly would be a conservative estimate of the
                            quantity of such chicle on which this Government is losing the export
                            tax of $5.00 per quintal. The Minister added that there was an even
                            greater loss to Guatemala arising from the much lower wages paid for
                            gathering this contraband chicle and the further fact that these wages
                            are paid with merchandise furnished by merchants in British Honduras and
                            Mexico. He estimated that the total loss might be reasonably fixed at
                            somewhere between $300,000 and $400,000 annually.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the foregoing Dr. Skinner Klee suggested that, if this
                            arrangement could be made, this Government might forbid the shipment of
                            alcoholic and spirituous liquors in transit through Guatemalan ports,
                            and thus extend its assistance in preventing the contraband shipment of
                            such liquors to the United States. He recalled in this connection the
                            shipment of liquor which was recently landed at Puerto Barrios in bond
                            (See my despatch No. 324 of August 31, 1934<note n="5" xml:id="d294fn5"
                                >Not printed.</note>) and immediately trans-shipped to other ports,
                            probably with the United States as its ultimate destination.</p>

                        <p>Inasmuch as Guatemala has expressed its desire to negotiate a commercial
                            agreement with the United States, the general purpose of which it is
                            clearly understood will be to remove or reduce existing barriers to

                        <p>I have consulted with Mr. Marsh in this connection and he has informed me

                            despatch No. 332 of September 5, 1934, reporting that the Guatemalan
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, in discussing with you the proposed trade
                            agreement between the United States and Guatemala, stated that a
                            concession which the United States might make would be to impose a duty
                            on chicle and exempt Guatemala from its effect.</p>
                        <p>In its negotiation of trade agreements under the Trade Agreements Act of
                            June 12, 1934,<note n="10" xml:id="d299fn10">48 Stat. 943.</note> the
                            Department does not contemplate departing from its policy of
                            unconditional and unrestricted most favored nation treatment, subject to
                            the usual exception regarding Cuba, and other generally recognized
                            exceptions. Moreover, the authority conferred upon the Executive by the
                            Trade Agreements Act does not extend to transferring tariff items from
                            the free to the dutiable list, nor to effecting any tariff reductions on
                            dutiable items in excess of fifty per cent. Inasmuch as chicle in its
                            natural state is on the free list, it is evident that the only
                            concession that could be granted would be one providing that this
                            product should continue to be admitted free of duty. Furthermore, under
                            the policy of most favored nation treatment this Government would not
                            discriminate in favor of the product of one country as against the
                            product of another unless the latter discriminated against the trade of
                            the United States or unless the acts or policies of such country were
                            such as to defeat the purposes of the Act.</p>
                        <p>In your conversations with officials of the Guatemalan Government on the
                            subject of the proposed trade agreement you may make such use of the
                            foregoing information as you may consider desirable.</p>

                            No. 332 of September 5, 1934, with regard to the proposed commercial
                            agreement between the United States and Guatemala and to report that
                            when I called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning he again
                            brought up the matter of contraband shipments of chicle from Guatemala
                                <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0356"/>with relation to contraband
                            shipments of alcohol from Puerto Barrios. I thereupon communicated to
                            the Minister the essence of the Department’s instruction No. 90 of
                            October 2, 1934, which was in reply to the despatch under reference.</p>
                        <p>In subsequent discussion the Minister inquired if it might not be
                            practicable to include in the prospective trade agreement an obligation
                            on the part of Guatemala to prevent contraband shipments of alcohol and
                            liquor from Guatemalan ports in return for an obligation on the part of
                            our Government to prevent the entry into the United States of contraband
                            shipments of chicle. He added in this connection that much chicle
                            originating in Guatemala is now being shipped to the United States
                            through Belize. I inquired of him how the American authorities would be
                            able to determine whether the chicle reaching the United States was of
                            contraband origin and he replied that the object he had in view might be
                            attained if the United States should require all shipments of chicle
                            from Belize to be accompanied by documents showing that the chicle
                            originated in British Honduras.</p>
                        <p>The Minister stated that he would like me to present the foregoing idea
                            for consideration in Washington.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to previous reports
                            concerning the proposed trade agreement with Guatemala, I have the honor
                            to transmit herewith a copy and translation of a letter which the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs here addressed to the Minister of Hacienda
                            on November 21, 1934.<note n="11" xml:id="d302fn11">Not printed.</note>
                            A copy of the letter was given to me informally and in confidence by Dr.
                            Skinner Klee. It appears that the Minister of Hacienda is seeking some
                            plan to restrict imports from countries, such as Japan, with which
                            Guatemala has an unfavorable balance of trade, and has requested the
                            advice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dr. Skinner Klee proposes to
                            solve this problem by establishing a differential tariff which will
                            impose a surtax on imports from countries with which Guatemala has an
                            unfavorable balance of trade, the amount of the surtax to be based on a
                            comparison of imports and exports of such countries by semesters.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to think that there is good
                            prospect for some such solution as this to be adopted. The Executive has
                            ample authority under its extraordinary powers to cover this matter by
                            executive decree.<note n="12" xml:id="d302fn12">By telegram No. 4,
                                January 29, 1935, 3 p.m., from the Minister in Guatemala, the
                                Department was informed that an Executive decree had been issued
                                January 26, 1935, increasing import duties 100% on all merchandise
                                from countries whose exports to Guatemala during the calendar year
                                1934 increased 100% in volume, and stating that its purpose was to
                                conserve the Guatemalan market for countries which purchase
                                Guatemalan products (611.1431/86).</note></p>

                                >Not printed.</note> in connection with the consideration which the

                            the wishes of the Guatemalan Government in suppressing the entry into
                            the United States of contraband chicle by the requirement of

                            I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the study being made by
                            the Committee as well as of the doubt expressed as to whether <pb
                                n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0358"/>the adoption of a requirement
                            for certificates of origin would be sufficient in itself to reduce
                            substantially shipments of contraband chicle out of Guatemala. I also
                            advised the Minister for Foreign Affairs that it would be of assistance
                            to the Inter-Departmental Committee if it could be provided with a
                            definite suggestion from this Government as to the nature of the
                            assistance by means of documentary requirements that is desired by this
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>In reply to my note I have now received a note dated December 20, 1934,
                            from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a copy and translation<note

                            herewith. It will be observed that the Minister of Finance and Public
                            Credit states that the procedure of requiring certificates of origin
                            would be absolutely useless in attempting to shut off the contraband
                            trade in chicle. It will be noted also that the note makes no definite
                            suggestion in response to the invitation set forth above.</p>

                            December 22, 1934, concerning trade in contraband chicle, the Department
                            observes that the Guatemalan Foreign Minister’s reply to your note No.
                            76, of November 19, 1934, merely states that if the United States should
                            require certificates of origin on chicle, that measure would be
                            “completely useless” in aiding the Guatemalan Government to suppress
                            contraband traffic in chicle.</p>
                        <p>In view of the negative nature of this reply, the Department will not
                            give any further attention to this subject unless the Guatemalan

                        <p>There are a great many aspects of this question which, I feel, should
                            receive the early attention of the Department. During the eighteen years
                            [in] which United States military forces have been present in Haiti,
                            large stocks of military and nonmilitary material have accumulated and
                            numerous buildings, both temporary and permanent, have been erected on
                            Government or privately owned land. It is believed that these structures
                            and a part of the stock of supplies on hand are not of sufficient value
                            to justify the expense of transportation to the United States, either
                            for sale or for use by the American Government there. It would seem that
                            in the disposition of this property our Government is offered an
                            excellent opportunity to make a generous gesture to the Haitian
                            Government which, properly handled, would have an excellent effect both
                            here and throughout Latin-America. Conversely, I feel that if our
                            Government should pursue a commercial dollars and cents policy, in
                            disposing of this property, the amount of money actually to be saved to
                            the Treasury could in no way compensate for the good will which might
                            otherwise be obtained. If existing statutes conflict with such a course,
                            the Department may wish to consider the advisability of having
                            appropriate legislation introduced at the next session of the United
                            States Congress.</p>
                        <p>The Garde d’Haiti, which has been built up to its present state of
                            efficiency through the efforts of American Marine Corps officers, is now
                            to be placed on its own resources with the sole assistance of a small
                            American Military Mission. The Garde d’Haiti has never owned its <pb
                                n="294" xml:id="pg_294" facs="0360"/>own rifles and the enclosed
                                letter<note n="4" xml:id="d305fn3">Not printed.</note> from General
                            Clayton B. Vogel, Commandant of the Garde, shows that the Marine Corps
                            proposes to sell the rifles, bayonets and scabbards now used by it for
                            the total amount of $36.645.00. While it is not questioned that this is
                            a reasonable price, if account be taken of the use they have had of
                            them, it is suggested that the interested departments of our Government
                            might be consulted with the object of materially reducing this figure.
                            It would of course be made clear to the Haitian Government that this
                            action was being taken as an expression of our good will. In addition to
                            these articles, the Garde d’Haiti is undoubtedly in need of other
                            equipment now carried by the First Brigade in Haiti which could be
                            transferred to it at a small, if not nominal, cost.</p>
                        <p>It is brought out in the attached memorandum that the Haitian Government
                            has, at various times, advanced the claim that American military forces
                            seized arms and equipment of the Haitian army at the time of the
                            original occupation and, furthermore, that buildings of the Haitian
                            Government, notably the barracks occupied by the Second Regiment, have
                            not been adequately paid for. While it was clearly brought out in the
                            letter of the Navy Department, dated February 6, 1933, to the Department
                            of State, a copy of which was forwarded to this Legation with

                                printed.</note> that this claim is without any serious foundation,
                            it occurs to me that an arrangement might advantageously be made with
                            the Haitian Government by which the latter would agree to withdraw any
                            claim for damages which it might have against the United States in
                            return for such generous treatment as we might be able to accord to it
                            in connection with the disposition of Government property.</p>
                        <p>The enclosed memorandum also raises the question of claims of private
                            citizens against the American Government for both official and
                            unofficial acts of the Marine forces in Haiti. It is my opinion that
                            this question is one which should receive very careful consideration at
                            this time. If we disregard it, we shall undoubtedly be plagued for a
                            long time after the withdrawal of our forces with many claims for
                            damages suffered by individual Haitians at our hands, claims which,
                            regardless of their frivolous nature, will be a source of constant
                            embarrassment. It would appear that this would be an advantageous moment
                            to work out, together with the Haitian Government if need be, some
                            program which will forestall future difficulties.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the settlement of claims, the services of a competent
                            Haitian lawyer will be required and I particularly invite the
                            Department’s attention to the recommendation in the enclosed memorandum
                            that an appropriation be made available to the Legation to employ such
                            services.</p>
                        <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0361"/>
                        <p>While I realize that many of the question[s] raised in this despatch and
                            the enclosed memorandum will have to be settled by the people here on
                            the ground, nevertheless I consider that before any final decisions can
                            be made here it will be necessary to have a general statement of policy
                            from the interested departments in Washington, together with precise
                            information as to the legal position which will be taken by the
                            Comptroller General in connection with the disposal of Government
                            property.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Department will have available information
                            concerning the manner of withdrawal of our forces from Santo Domingo and
                            Nicaragua which will be of assistance in determining the best course of
                            action in the present case. It is probable that the Comptroller General
                            has, in the past, rendered decisions concerning the sale of Government
                            property to foreign governments under similar circumstances. It is
                            requested that any of this information which might be of use to the
                            Legation be forwarded to Port-au-Prince.</p>
                        <p>Despite the fact that almost a year remains before the withdrawal of the
                            Marine forces from Haiti, it is urgently recommended that the questions
                            raised herein, concerning the sale of rifles and other equipment to the
                            Garde d’Haiti, and the disposal of Marine Corps property, be given the
                            Department’s early consideration.</p>

                            accompanied the President. The President and his party were driven
                            through the streets of the city to the temporary presidential palace
                            where approximately three hundred persons including Haitian and American
                            officials and citizens had gathered to greet him. Brief speeches were
                            made by both Presidents following which a private conversation was held
                            the subject and communiqué of which is to be announced in a communiqué
                            issued by the Haitian Government. Text of speeches and communiqué will
                            be forwarded to the Department by air mail. The main points to be
                            referred to in the communiqué are: (1) announcement of complete
                            Haitianization of the Garde on August 1st and withdrawal of Marine
                            forces during the fortnight following—the President referred to this in
                            his speech; (2) announcement of the action of the Congress authorizing
                            the President to give a portion of Marine Corps equipment in Haiti to
                            the Haitian Government; and (3) announcement that negotiations would
                            shortly be undertaken for conclusion of a commercial treaty.</p>
                        <p>Following reception the President returned to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Houston</hi> receiving President Vincent on board about noon. I was
                            able to be present <pb n="298" xml:id="pg_298" facs="0364"/>at this
                            meeting. The visit of the President was an unqualified success from
                            every point of view. The President expressed himself to me as being
                            greatly pleased with the visit. While, of course, full reports have been
                            forwarded by the press the President felt that an official report should
                            be sent to the Department for such use as it may wish to make of it.</p>

                            provisions of Articles I, II and V of the Accord of August 7, 1933.</p>
                        <p>The proposed note will have the effect of placing into force the informal
                            agreement reached between President Roosevelt and President Vincent in
                            their conversations at Cape Haitian on July 5 for the complete
                            Haitianization of the Garde d’Haiti on August 1, 1934, and the
                            withdrawal of the Marine Forces now in Haiti within the following

                            morning, expressed the hope that a prompt reply could be received from
                            the Department so as to permit the proposed exchange of notes to be
                            effected at as early a date as possible. It is respectfully requested
                            that the Department telegraph the Legation authorization for the
                            exchange of notes together with any changes in the text thereof which
                            may be necessary.</p>
                        <p>For the information of the Department, I have the honor to enclose copies
                            of the communiqué issued by the Haitian Government following the
                            conversations of July 5 at Cape Haitian. While the communiqué was
                            originally drafted by the Foreign Office, certain necessary changes in
                            the text thereof were made by the Legation prior to submitting it to the
                            President. The President personally inserted the words appearing at the
                            end of the second paragraph, “a fortnight later,” instead of, “on August
                            15, 1934,” as originally provided, with the understanding that this
                            expression when rendered into French would furnish a certain latitude
                            with regard to the date of final evacuation. The revised communiqué
                            proved acceptable to President <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0365"
                            />Vincent and was published by the Government in the form of a
                            communiqué in the semi official <hi rend="italic">Haiti-Journal</hi>
                            with the English text appearing as the original and the French text
                            given as a translation.</p>
                        <p>The Commandant of the Garde d’Haiti informs the Legation that plans are
                            being completed for the carrying out of the new arrangement and the
                            Director of the American Scientific Mission has indicated his intention
                            of turning over his service to the Haitian Government as of the same
                            date, August 1. It has been learned informally that the First Brigade
                            has received no information from the Navy Department concerning the date
                            when transports or other vessels will be furnished to evacuate the
                            members of that organization.</p>

                            <p>During the conversation held today, July fifth, in Cape Haitian,
                                between President Roosevelt and President Vincent, the following

                                        and upon the request of the Haitian Government, it has been
                                        agreed that the Garde d’Haiti will be turned over to
                                        complete Haitian command on August 1, 1934. All American
                                        Marine forces now in Haiti will be withdrawn a fortnight
                                        later.</item>

                                    <item>President Roosevelt informed President Vincent of the
                                        action of the Congress of United States which authorized him
                                        to present to the Haitian Government a portion of the
                                        equipment belonging to the American Government, now in use
                                        by the Garde d’Haiti and Marine forces in Haiti.</item>

                                        governments for the conclusion of a commercial treaty the
                                        underlying principles of which have been under discussion

                                have served to reaffirm the feeling of friendship and cordiality
                                existing between the United States and Haiti, a feeling which was
                                signally marked in the course of their conversations held last April
                                in the city of Washington, D. C.</p>

                                n="16" xml:id="d313fn16">Not printed.</note> relating to the

                            located in Haiti.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the list of property set forth in the Navy
                            Department’s letter is somewhat smaller than that contained in the lists
                            referred to in the Department’s telegraphic instruction No. 51 of June
                            21, 1934. After checking these lists with the Navy Department’s letter,
                            you will please report by telegraph whether in your judgment the
                            property as listed in the Navy Department’s letter is adequate to cover
                            the commitment made by President Roosevelt to President Vincent, and
                            authorized in the law mentioned in the Department’s telegraphic
                            instruction referred to above. It is noted in this connection that the
                            three 37 mm saluting guns are not included in matériel listed in the
                            Navy Department’s letter. Please discuss this with the Brigade Commander
                            and submit, in the telegraphic report requested above, your
                            recommendations with respect to including these three guns in the
                            matériel to be transferred.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the last paragraph of the Navy Department’s letter, the
                            Department is of the opinion that it should be possible to <pb n="302"
                                xml:id="pg_302" facs="0368"/>effect the transfer of the property and

                            mentioned by means of an exchange of notes between the Legation and the
                            Haitian Government. Please discuss this immediately with the Haitian
                            Government and advise by telegraph whether the suggested procedure is
                            agreeable to that Government.</p>

                            contained in Navy Department’s letter of June 10.</p>
                        <p>While quantities of individual items now on hand have in certain
                            instances decreased since the original lists were prepared it is
                            believed that transfer of such property in addition to transfer of
                            additional property as set forth below will nevertheless comply with
                            both spirit and letter of commitments made by our Government vis-à-vis
                            the Haitian Government. General Little concurs in this view and General
                            Vogel has expressed satisfaction with property on lists which will
                            presumably be turned over by the Haitian Government to the Garde
                            d’Haiti.</p>
                        <p>It is understood that proper authorization has now been received for
                            transfer of following: (1) radio station complete, (2) one hangar, (3)
                            all telephone wire, (4) all buildings and appurtenances on land owned by
                            the Haitian Government or held under leases or easements, (5) certain
                            surveyed hospital equipment, (6) items as included on list in Navy
                            Department’s letter referred to with differences explained above. All
                            classes of property which have previously been directed by headquarters
                            United States Marine Corps to be surveyed and sold in Haiti are at
                            present being prepared for delivery to the Haitian Government. We all
                            agree that no property should be sold under any circumstances.</p>
                        <p>With reference to three 37 mm guns Generals Little, Vogel, and I agree
                            that for various reasons it will not be desirable to transfer such
                            equipment. I do not believe that the Haitian Government expects to
                            receive the guns referred to.</p>

                            Affairs has informally agreed to effect exchange of notes as suggested

                            all obligations under existing leases and easements <pb n="303"

                            Haitian Government, together with a draft of an agreement to modify the
                            agreement of August 7, 1933, relating to the withdrawal of the marine
                            forces in Haiti.</p>
                        <p>The Department has duly noted your reference to the change made
                            personally by President Roosevelt with respect to the wording “a
                            fortnight later” instead of “on August 15, 1934”, as submitted in the
                            Haitian draft enclosed with your despatch under acknowledgment. The
                            Department has accordingly changed the wording at the end of the first
                            paragraph in the draft note and redrafted the draft agreement to conform
                            with the wording used by President Roosevelt, as well as eliminating any
                            reference to treaties in Article III, as treaties cannot be modified by
                            executive agreement.</p>

                            together with the redrafted form of agreement and state that it is not
                            the desire of this Government in any way to retard the withdrawal of the
                            marine forces, but in view of the fact that President Roosevelt himself
                            desired a change in the wording in the communiqué, it is highly
                            desirable that the President’s wording be used. If the Haitian
                            Government agrees to substitute the redrafted note and agreement for its
                            original drafts, you may proceed to exchange notes and to sign the
                            agreement immediately, using the principle of the <hi rend="italic"

                            receipt of Your Excellency’s note of July 21, 1934, in which you state
                            that, during the conversations held at Cape Haitian on July 5 last
                            between His Excellency, President Vincent, and His Excellency, President
                            Roosevelt, at the request of the Haitian Government and in view of the
                            rapid progress of the Garde d’Haiti, an understanding was reached to
                            terminate on August 1, 1934, the services of the American officers in
                            that organization and that, a fortnight later, the Marine Brigade will
                            be withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>With a view to giving effect to this understanding, Your Excellency has
                            communicated to me, on behalf of Your Government, a draft accord with
                            the request that I communicate to you, with the least possible delay,
                            the views of my Government with regard to it in order that a date in the
                            near future may be fixed for the signature of the accord to be reached

                            draft of the accord transmitted by you meets with its approval. It is
                            proposed, therefore, that, if convenient to you, July 24 next be set for
                            the date of signature.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, permit me to express the deep appreciation of my
                            Government of the reference made to the President of the United States
                            in Your Excellency’s note. It is needless to assure Your Excellency that
                            the friendly disposition shown by the President of the United States is
                            prompted by the desire, as he himself said in his address at Cape
                            Haitian on July 5 last, to see the spirit of friendship and
                            understanding that exists between the Governments and peoples of Haiti
                            and the United States continue and become even stronger as the years go
                            on.</p>

                                August 21 next has been set aside as the day to celebrate the
                                beginning of a new era in Haiti and as one who has worked
                                consistently to bring about that which you will celebrate on that
                                day I wish to be one of the first to extend to you, and through you,
                                to the people of Haiti, my heartiest congratulations and good wishes
                                for the future of the next oldest republic of our hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>Since my visit to Haiti in 1917, I have followed developments in your
                                country with the greatest interest and it has been my sincere desire
                                to see relations between our two countries placed on the friendliest
                                possible footing. To this end, since my coming into office, the
                                Government of the United States has sought to withdraw from all
                                participation in Haitian internal affairs.</p>
                            <p>The Haitianization of the Garde and the withdrawal of the American
                                Marines have been accomplished at a date earlier than was thought
                                possible largely through the close cooperation and good will
                                existing between the Haitian and American officers and men which has
                                made possible rapid progress in the handing over to Haitian officers
                                of the high commands. But the wise administration of Your
                                Excellency, and the sense of responsibility and sincere desire of
                                those in Haiti charged with the Executive, Legislative and Judicial
                                functions of the Government, to see a Haiti united to meet the
                                problems confronting all nations today, have also, I feel, been
                                important factors in bringing about this happy solution which we all
                                join you in celebrating.</p>
                            <p>Finally, it is my earnest hope that the plan now under consideration
                                by the Haitian Government providing for the complete withdrawal of
                                the Government of the United States from all participation in the
                                administration of Haitian finance, which I feel represents the limit
                                to which my Government can properly go, and yet remain faithful to
                                its obligations, may prove acceptable, and that following the
                                conclusion of a new treaty putting an end to those now in existence,
                                we may in the future be bound only by those ties of friendship and
                                mutual beneficial economic intercourse which should unite friendly
                                and neighboring republics.</p>
                            <p>I have but recently returned to Washington after the conclusion of my
                                long voyage to Hawaii, but the memory of my delightful visit to Cape
                                Haitian and the warm and friendly reception accorded me by Your
                                Excellency and all officials of the Haitian Government is still
                                fresh in my mind.</p>

                            new thing to Your Excellency’s attention when I point out that, without
                            need of going <pb n="309" xml:id="pg_309" facs="0375"/>farther back,
                            from 1926–1927 to 1930–1931, the Republic of Haiti received from the
                            United States 72.60 per cent of its total imports, while the United
                            States, for the same period, absorbed only 8.21 per cent of Haitian
                            exports. Your Excellency is familiar with the situation which these
                            figures reveal.</p>
                        <p>I must add that, in 1931–1932, out of a total of 37,305,551 gourdes
                            imports, Haiti purchased from the United States the amount of 25,12,282
                            gourdes, while, for the same year, the United States bought from Haiti
                            only in the amount of 2,925,762 gourdes out of total exports 36,106,394
                            gourdes.</p>
                        <p>My Government thinks, and rightly, that certain Haitian products, sugar,
                            alcohol, rum, fig-bananas, for example, might find an advantageous
                            market in the United States, which is the more desirable because this
                            flow of trade would permit us, as much as possible, as it developed, to
                            equalize the direct balance of payments between our two countries. My
                            Government, also, believes that the best means of assuring this happy
                            result, would be to establish between the two countries a New Commercial
                            Treaty which would favor and encourage, by way of reciprocity, the flow
                            of imports from Haiti into the United States.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that I have been
                            charged to begin, without any unnecessary delay, negotiations to these
                            ends, if the Department of State deems such negotiations opportune, as
                            does the Government of Haiti, and values as it does the efficaciousness
                            of such a treaty and the reciprocal advantages which will result from it

                            the question at considerable length of reciprocal trade relations
                            between Haiti and the United States; he spoke of the great good which
                            would come to Haiti if a better market could be found in the United
                            States for certain Haitian products which were not in competition with
                            those produced in the United States; he mentioned Haitian coffee, which
                            100 years ago went exclusively to the United States; he also mentioned
                            Haitian rum, which was a specialty of its own, different from that of
                            Cuban or any other type of rum; he hoped <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310"
                                facs="0376"/>very much that something could be done to equalize or

                            two countries.</p>

                        <p>Reference is made to the note of January 13, 1934, from the Minister of
                            Haiti expressing the interest of his Government in the negotiation of a
                            new commercial treaty for the promotion of trade between the United
                            States and Haiti.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is prepared at once to institute a
                            study of the trade relations between the two countries with a view to
                            determining the possibility of concluding a mutually profitable
                            agreement, and is instructing the Minister of the United States at Port
                            au Prince to explore the situation in consultation with the authorities
                            of the Haitian Government with a view to submitting recommendations
                            regarding the terms of such an agreement. If, as a result of these
                            studies, both Governments consider that a mutually advantageous
                            agreement might be concluded this Government, for its part, will be
                            happy to proceed with negotiations to this end.</p>

                            which was today handed to the Minister of Haiti,<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d326fn26"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> in regard to
                            the exploration of the possibility of concluding a mutually advantageous
                            trade agreement between the two countries. In accordance therewith you
                            are instructed to explore the situation in consultation with the Haitian
                            authorities with a view to submitting recommendations regarding the
                            terms of such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>In considering the terms of a reciprocal trade agreement with Haiti it is
                            necessary to keep in mind the relation of such negotiations to similar
                            negotiations between the United States and other countries. In
                            conformity with the principle of unconditional most favored nation
                            treatment a concession by the United States on any given product <pb
                                n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0377"/>of one country must be extended
                            freely to the like product of other countries. Consequently it is
                            necessary as a general rule in carrying out a reciprocity program to
                            confine the concessions made to each country to products of which that
                            country is an important source of imports into the United States. It is
                            evident that if a concession were granted to one country on a product
                            which is of outstanding importance to another, and if the latter by
                            virtue of the most favored nation principle obtained the benefit of the
                            concession freely, the basis for later negotiations with such other
                            country would be impaired. Normally in such negotiations concessions
                            will be confined to products of which each country is the chief source
                            of imports into the United States. Statistical studies indicate that
                            under such a plan an ample basis for bargaining with the most of the
                            important countries of the world could be maintained.</p>
                        <p>However, a preliminary survey indicates that the only important product
                            of which Haiti is the chief source of imports into the United States is
                            logwood, which is at present free of duty. This Government might
                            therefore undertake in the proposed agreement that no duty shall be
                            imposed on this product. With respect to such products as coffee and
                            bananas on the other hand, the situation is different. Other countries
                            are far more important as sources of imports of these products than is
                            Haiti and if the United States undertook in an agreement with Haiti that
                            coffee and bananas should continue to be free of duty the basis for
                            bargaining with Brazil, Honduras and other countries might be impaired.
                            Consequently if such products as coffee and bananas were dealt with in
                            the proposed agreement it would probably be necessary to postpone
                            actually bringing the agreement into force until agreements have been
                            negotiated with other countries interested in these products.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing considerations two alternatives present
                            themselves as follows: <list>
                                <label>1)</label>
                                <item>The proposed agreement might contain commitments by the United
                                    States respecting only those products of which Haiti is the
                                    chief source of importations into the United States. Such an
                                    agreement could be brought into force independently of
                                    agreements to be negotiated between the United States and other
                                    countries. If an agreement along these lines were decided upon a
                                    careful study should be made of Haiti’s production and trade
                                    with a view to determining whether there are any special
                                    products, other than logwood, of which Haiti is, or is likely to
                                    be, the chief foreign source of importations into the United
                                    States. While such an agreement would probably directly benefit
                                    only one Haitian product this Government would be prepared to
                                    renew in the proposed agreement the provision for general
                                    unconditional most favored nation treatment contained in the
                                    Executive Agreement signed July 8, 1926.<note n="27"

                                    a source of such imports into the United States than is
                                    Haiti.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>In considering the concessions to be granted by Haiti to the commerce of
                            the United States due regard must be had for the value of the
                            concessions which the United States is likely to be in a position to
                            offer in return; and for the effect of any concessions by Haiti on the
                            revenues of that country. Any concessions or commitments requested of
                            Haiti should be confined to products of which the United States is
                            clearly the chief source of imports into that country. This is desirable
                            because, if a concession were made by Haiti to the United States on a
                            product of which another country is the chief source of Haiti’s imports
                            and to which Haiti accords most favored nation treatment, such other
                            country would be the principal beneficiary of any such concession and
                            Haiti’s bargaining position in any negotiations which might later be
                            entered into with the country concerned would be unnecessarily
                            impaired.</p>

                                n="28" xml:id="d327fn28">Lucien Hibbert, the Haitian Minister of
                                Finance to May 1934, had accompanied the President of Haiti on his
                                visit to the United States in March-April, 1934. See <ref

                            to become acquainted. The conversation commenced in a rather general way
                            about business and economic conditions in Haiti. The Minister of Finance
                            then gradually proceeded to refer to conditions and to the trade
                            relations between his country and the United States and also his country
                            and France. He pointed out that Haiti bought from the United States far
                            more than she sold; that she sold most of her coffee to France and this
                            trade with France would be increased under the comparatively recent
                            trade agreement entered into between the two governments.<note n="29"

                            reciprocity trade agreement between our <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313"
                                facs="0379"/>two governments which would increase the volume of
                            mutually reciprocal and profitable trade between the two countries. He
                            stressed different phases of these possibilities, including such items
                            as bananas and sugar especially, and he stated he wanted his country to
                            sell 30,000 tons of sugar to us. His plea was that these expanded trade
                            relations between our two countries would be extremely helpful to Haiti
                            just now in the way of improved business conditions, improved living
                            standards, and improved government credit, both internal and external.
                            He did not press, on the occasion of this visit of himself and the
                            President of Haiti, the question of dealing anew and finally with the
                            external debt of Haiti and United States supervision of the fiscal
                            affairs of his government. I inferred that they had in mind the idea of
                            completing a suitable commercial treaty arrangement at the earliest
                            possible date—presenting much data, memoranda, etc., as a basis while
                            they were here on this visit and otherwise laying all the foundations
                            for speedy negotiation and completion of the commercial agreement
                            proposed. He stated that business was fairly good in his country and
                            that there was and had been comparatively little unemployment.</p>
                        <p>I replied to the Minister of Finance by offering the usual expressions of
                            welcome and of the warm friendship for the officials of his government
                            and the people of his country on the part of the officials and people of
                            my country. At the outset I had assured the Finance Minister of the keen
                            interest of my government in the progress and welfare of his people, and
                            I stated that we would be only too glad to proceed to the extent of
                            receiving from him and his President any and all facts, data, and
                            memoranda, for purposes of trade agreement negotiations at the earliest
                            possible date; that until Congress passed the pending measure providing
                            the Executive branch of the government with authority to negotiate such
                            arrangements in the manner and to the extent provided for in the bill,
                            we would not be in a position to enter upon formal negotiations nor to
                            make public the preliminary conversations in connection with such
                            planned negotiations. I assured the Minister of Finance and his
                            associates present that I was opposed to driving any hard bargains with
                            his government in the present circumstances at least; that I much
                            preferred to meet his government a full half way and in fact to be
                            really liberal in entering into the proposed reciprocal trade
                            arrangements; that I might repeat what I had said to the Haitian
                            Delegation to Montevideo,<note n="30" xml:id="d327fn30">See <ref

                            the effect that my government was three times as anxious to clear up any
                            complicated relationships with the Haitian Government pertaining to
                            financial phases and get them behind us for all time, than even the
                            Haitian Delegation could possibly be; that I could reiterate this in
                            stronger terms if possible. I stated generally <pb n="314"
                                xml:id="pg_314" facs="0380"/>that my government desired to enter
                            into more satisfactory trade relations with many other countries—all of
                            them based upon the principle of equal and mutual profit; that in some
                            instances steps towards ironing out, improving and clearing up any
                            existing economic or financial relationships with his or other
                            countries, might call for patience and a greater length of time than
                            might be expected, or, on the other hand, such objective might be
                            brought about within a short period of time; that this observation was
                            not intended for his government any more than any and all others, but
                            was a precautionary remark. I reminded him that the United States
                            purchased more from Latin America as a whole than it sold to that
                            region, just as it bought more from the Orient than it sold to it; that
                            these triangular trade conditions did really exist, and that while every
                            two nations should exhaust all reasonable efforts to expand as fully as
                            possible their trade relations to the extent mutually profitable, there
                            were in fact numerous instances where this would not be possible—as in
                            the case of Brazil and the United States in which the United States
                            purchased only the amount of coffee it needed and Brazil had to sell the
                            balance in other parts of the world, or in the case of Chile with her
                            nitrates, or the Argentine with her wheat and meats, etc., etc. I
                            referred to the proximity of Haiti to the United States and to the
                            special connections by steamship and aeroplane lines with the consequent
                            convenience to both nations which should make possible a steady increase
                            in commerce, and I stated that apart from our friendly interest in the
                            people of Haiti and our desire to aid them in every feasible way, we
                            could well join in their view about agreements to improve their business
                            relations.</p>

                            that it would be advisable to have the conversations conducted in

                            the Haitian Minister would be advisable. May I suggest to the Haitian
                            Government that his departure about August 2 after the return of

                        <p>81. Department’s telegram No. 68, July 26, 3 p.m. My idea in having De la
                            Rue proceed August 2 was not only for commercial treaty negotiations but
                            the importance of having him available during August for possible

                            modifications in contract as well as to assist Blanchet later when our
                            Government is ready to begin preliminary conversations looking towards

                            Haiti, expressing the interest of his Government in the negotiation of a
                            new commercial treaty for the promotion of trade between the United
                            States and Haiti, and to the memorandum of February 20, 1934, which was

                            possibilities of concluding a mutually advantageous trade agreement
                            between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>On June 12, 1934, the President of the United States of America approved

                            agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof.<note

                        <p>Referring to the memorandum of the 15th of August, current, by which the
                            Department of State was good enough to inform the Minister of Haiti that
                            an inter-Departmental Committee, composed of officers of the various
                            interested Departments, has been charged to study the possibility of
                            concluding, between the United States and Haiti, a commercial Agreement
                            which would be mutually advantageous and that this Committee is ready to
                            receive the proposals of the Haitian Government, the Minister of Haiti
                            has the honor to make known to the United States the views of his own
                            Government, as follows:</p>
                        <p>In the first place, it gives great satisfaction to the Haitian Government
                            to render homage to the alert and decisive spirit of the United States
                            Government which, in the persistent crisis in world commerce—a commerce
                            the contraction of which has already caused so serious a prejudice to
                            all—has resolutely undertaken to reestablish the currents of interchange
                            which have been broken by irritated nationalisms or to strengthen the
                            currents weakened by too long a stagnation, or to excite new currents by
                            bilateral arrangements, based on equity, good sense, and reciprocity of
                            advantage.</p>
                        <p>It also gives great satisfaction to the Haitian Republic to contemplate
                            on this solid basis a useful commercial treaty with the United States
                            according to the promise of His Excellency President Roosevelt, the
                            realization of which promise will mark the new era which is beginning in
                            the relations of the two countries.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Haitian Republic has always been one of the most
                            faithful customers of the United States. She is a faithful customer
                            today as yesterday. And there was a time when the United States appeared
                            among the best customers of Haiti.</p>
                        <p>A hundred years ago the excellent coffee of Haiti was consumed in the
                            United States almost to the exclusion of any other coffee. At that
                            far-off period the United States consumed twenty-seven million pounds of
                            coffee, of which some twenty-five to twenty-six millions of <pb n="318"
                                xml:id="pg_318" facs="0384"/>pounds came from the Haitian Republic.
                            Haitian coffee is no longer consumed here, except by a very few persons
                            who prefer it; unfortunately, this has been the case for a long time
                            past.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, Haitian coffee is much sought after in Europe. It is
                            in constant demand, particularly in France, in Italy, and in the
                            Scandinavian countries which absorb, every year, all of the insufficient
                            crop of Haiti.</p>
                        <p>Today—and for a long time past—the United States furnishes the Haitian
                            Republic with the greater part of her imports, while taking only an
                            insignificant portion of her exports.</p>
                        <p>Official statistics show that for the years 1929–1934 Haiti has bought
                            from the United States twelve times more than the United States has
                            bought in Haiti: while seventy-two percent of Haitian imports come from
                            the United States, only six percent of Haitian exports go to the United
                            States. Such a situation is tolerable in normal times. Haitian sales,
                            principally in Europe, cover Haitian purchases from the United States,
                            although the commercial balance between Haiti and the United States is
                            favorable to the United States in the proportion of sixty-six
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>But in abnormal times, in the crisis which still rages and which has
                            caused almost all the national economies to withdraw into themselves
                            under the protection of forced quotas, this situation imperils Haitian
                            economy which rests precariously on the sale of its principal exportable
                            produce and a purely fiscal customs regime.</p>
                        <p>The only theoretical means of reducing, for the Haitian Republic, the
                            risks inherent in this situation, is to seek to establish a certain
                            equilibrium in foreign purchases and sales by the application of the
                            “give and take” which others do not hesitate to apply against Haiti.</p>
                        <p>It is neither the intention nor the desire of the Haitian Government to
                            apply, in the commercial relations between Haiti and the United States,
                            this rule which France and Italy, finding themselves, with respect to
                            Haiti, in a position similar to that of Haiti with respect to the United
                            States, have applied against Haiti for the legitimate defense of their
                            respective economies.</p>
                        <p>Haiti would not think of having recourse to it except at the last
                            extremity, that is to say, if she should be in the position of being
                            forced to do so in order to subsist. But she well realizes that other
                            things being equal, and even when conditions are more or less slightly
                            different, the United States market, because of its nearness and its
                            enormous productive capacity, is for her a natural market of supply,
                            quite as it ought to be or to become for Haiti an enormous natural
                            outlet for the sale of her own products.</p>
                        <p>In order to allow the Haitian Republic in her present situation—which is
                            so manifestly disadvantageous with respect to the United <pb n="319"
                                xml:id="pg_319" facs="0385"/>States—to maintain her purchases here
                            at their present level and to increase the volume, as it is desirable to
                            do, it seems to be extremely necessary that the United States
                            Government, acting with perfect awareness of the situation, should aid
                            her to increase her power to purchase from the United States by
                            according to her a treatment facilitating the entry into the United
                            States market and the sale therein of the products of her soil and her
                            industry.</p>
                        <p>It is for this reason, which is at the same time so simple and so
                            reasonable, that the Haitian Government proposes, with all confidence,
                            that the United States Government should consent to the broadest
                            possible special treatment in favor of the following Haitian
                            products:</p>
                        <p>Rum made from pure sugar-cane juice, sugar, coffee, cacao, long-staple
                            cotton, pita, logwood, cachou nuts, goat skins, fig bananas, and other
                            fresh and preserved fruits, Haitian pulse, as well as embroidery work
                            and hand-made lingerie, etc., etc.</p>
                        <p>Some of the articles mentioned above are already carried on the free list
                            of the United States tariff. The Haitian Government thinks that, in the
                            interest of the economic development of the country, it would be well to
                            assure the maintenance of such exemptions.</p>

                            of America to Haiti on which tariff concessions are being sought by the
                            United States in the proposed trade agreement between the two
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the concessions requested are only for reductions <pb
                                n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0386"/>in the duties now being imposed
                            on the corresponding commodities in the Haitian tariff. In two
                            instances, however, reclassification and duty reductions are requested.
                            Moreover, with respect to paper and cardboard commercial advertisements,
                            as well as cardboard containers of imported articles, the requested
                            duty-free entry of these articles is merely for the sake of the removal
                            of barriers to trade. In no case has preferential treatment been
                            requested for products of the United States of America as compared with
                            similar products from any third country. For the sake of convenience,
                            opposite each of the items listed there are indicated the paragraph
                            number in the Haitian tariff, the rate of duty now required to be
                            imposed, and the proposed duty to be provided for in the trade
                            agreement.</p>
                        <p>At a later date it is planned to submit to the Haitian Government a draft
                            of the text of the proposed trade agreement for study by the Haitian
                            Government prior to reaching a common agreement and understanding as to
                            the terms and provisions to be contained therein. In order to save time,
                            however, it is deemed advisable to submit at present the list of
                            specific tariff concessions being sought by this Government, referred to
                            as Schedule I, with a view to affording the Haitian Government ample
                            time to study these proposals. The United States Government in
                            submitting the attached list of desired concessions reserves the right
                            to request, in the course of subsequent negotiations, the modification
                            of certain burdensome regulations affecting imports in general that
                            would not call for reductions in duty but that would tend toward the
                            removal of restrictions on trade.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States is prepared to receive and give
                            serious consideration to any proposals which the Haitian Government may
                            choose to present in connection with the general terms and provisions of
                            the proposed trade agreement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In connection with the proposed trade
                            agreement between the United States and Haiti, you are informed that a
                            list of specific concessions has not been officially requested of the
                            Department by the Haitian Government. Both the Haitian Minister and Mr.
                            de la Rue have, however, made known in a general way the nature of the
                            concessions being sought by Haiti, and the Department has deemed its
                            expedient to indicate informally to them the extent to which this
                            Government will probably be able to meet the wishes of the Haitian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>On one commodity, rum, it is likely that a reduction in duty of <pb
                                n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0387"/>from $5.00 to $2.50 per gallon
                            can be granted, although the Haitian desire for a separate
                            classification of sugar-cane rum is considered impracticable on grounds
                            of policy and administration. On fresh pineapples we will probably be
                            able to reduce the tariff from $0.50 to $0.35 per crate and from 11/6
                            cents to 9/10 cents each in bulk. In addition, this Government is
                            prepared to agree to maintain sisal and logwood on the free list for the
                            life of the agreement. With respect to coffee, cocoa-beans, bananas and
                            goatskins, the fact that Haiti is a very minor supplier makes it
                            impossible, under our most-favored nation policy, to give Haiti a
                            guaranty of continued free entry without seriously impairing our
                            bargaining position with other more important suppliers. In connection
                            with these products, however, the Department will be pleased to give
                            Haiti an undertaking in the form of an unconditional most-favored nation
                            provision, which will assure her continued free entry on an equality
                            with any major suppliers that may be guaranteed such treatment in later
                            trade agreements.</p>
                        <p>By virtue of this suggested unconditional most-favored nation provision,
                            Haiti could expect in all probability to receive the benefits of tariff
                            reductions on such commodities as long-staple cotton, cashew nuts,
                            orange peel, hand embroidery, limes, and logwood extract if, as is
                            considered likely, such reductions are agreed to in trade agreements
                            with the major suppliers of these products in the course of the next few
                            months. As in the case of binding on the free list commodities of which
                            Haiti is a minor supplier, the granting of tariff reductions on these
                            products to Haiti at the present time would seriously impair the
                            position of the United States in its negotiation of agreements with the
                            leading suppliers.</p>
                        <p>The Department is of the opinion that the possible concessions indicated
                            above fully meet the desires of the Haitian Government as made known to
                            the Department with the exception of one requested concession on sugar.
                            The request of Haiti that she be granted a quota substantially greater
                            than the one prescribed for 1934 cannot be acceded to because of the
                            discrimination that it would involve. However, it has been brought to
                            the attention of the Haitian Minister and of Mr. de la Rue that Haiti
                            continues to enjoy the right to export unlimited quantities of
                            “draw-back” sugar to the United States; and it is believed that the
                            problem of disposing of the Haitian export sugar crop might well be
                            taken care of through that means.</p>
                        <p>The above is for your strictly confidential information and to serve you
                            as background in case the subject of the proposed trade agreement is
                            brought up in any conversations you may have either with President
                            Vincent or with Monsieur Blanchet, who is now on his way to

                            officials regarding the proposed trade agreement please impress upon
                            them the great importance of not disclosing any of the suggested
                            concessions to Haiti which would be contingent upon the success of trade
                            agreement negotiations with other countries.</p>

                        <p>On the subject of the contemplated commercial treaty between the United
                            States and Haiti, it is necessary not to lose sight of the fact that it
                            ought to be a mutually advantageous treaty as President Roosevelt has
                            promised, as President Vincent has announced and as the special
                            situation of Haiti with respect to the United States gives reason to
                            hope.</p>
                        <p>Haiti purchases from the United States ten times more than the United
                            States purchases in Haiti.</p>
                        <p>Haiti desires to increase as much as possible the volume of her purchases
                            in the United States and it goes without saying that this result cannot
                            be obtained except on condition of increasing in some way Haiti’s power
                            to purchase in the United States, for, in the last analysis, domestic
                            and international commerce is nothing but an exchange of commodities and
                            of services.</p>
                        <p>It follows that the best and perhaps the only practical means of
                            increasing such purchasing power is to facilitate the entry and
                            distribution of Haitian products in the United States market.</p>
                        <p>It is hardly necessary to point out that the whole production of
                            Haiti—whether the present production or an increased production—could be
                            easily absorbed by the enormous consumption of the United States market
                            without its being even’ noticed and therefore without the slightest
                            disturbance to the economy of the United States.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government is in accord with the United States Government in
                            recognizing and taking note of the fact that the great obstacle to
                            commerce and to the reestablishment of normal conditions of
                            international exchange comes from the high tariffs and the restrictions
                            which almost everywhere constitute real barriers.</p>
                        <pb n="323" xml:id="pg_323" facs="0389"/>
                        <p>In this connection, it must be admitted that the Haitian customs tariff
                            which was recast in 1926, and has not been modified since 1926, is not
                            at all a prohibitive or a restrictive tariff; it only contains some
                            duties which constitute protection for some industries of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>And it is important to note that Haiti is, first of all, a small
                            agricultural country for which it is materially impossible to purchase
                            without selling abroad and which, furthermore, is afflicted with a
                            customs regime which is almost exclusively fiscal; its budget is
                            supplied by the export and import duties raised in accordance with the
                            tariff in force, which duties constitute its principal revenues.</p>
                        <p>Hence arises the almost insurmountable difficulty of lowering the custom
                            charges without reducing the vital resources of the country, which
                            resources are, furthermore, pledged.</p>
                        <p>Having no customs barrier of her own, the Haitian Republic cordially
                            desires to contribute in her modest way, and in harmony with the United
                            States Government, to the general lowering of customs barriers which
                            interfere with international commerce; but she cannot and she ought not
                            to expose herself, by undertaking engagements without an assured
                            equivalent, to losing, in the conflict of exasperated nationalisms, the
                            outlets which are already precarious and which she has only been able to
                            retain until now by special arrangements and at the price of
                            sacrifices.</p>
                        <p>For the foregoing reasons, the Haitian Government is under the necessity
                            of insisting on proposing that there be accorded to the Haitian products
                            previously designated a treatment which would facilitate their entry
                            into the American market, and that the Agreement be so drawn up that a
                            really practical, useful and mutually advantageous commercial agreement
                            may be concluded between the United States and Haiti.</p>

                            proposed agreement which includes a revised list of concessions proposed
                            to be granted to the United States as well as those proposed to be
                            granted <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0390"/>to Haiti by the United
                            States, the two lists being entitled, respectively, Schedule I and
                            Schedule II.<note n="40" xml:id="d341fn40">The schedules are not
                                printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It is desired to point out that the concessions included under Schedule I
                            differ in several instances from those on the list attached to the State
                            Department’s memorandum of November 10, last. The modifications of this
                            Schedule have been made as a result of informal exchanges of views on
                            the subject between Mr. de la Rue and officials of the Department of
                            State.</p>
                        <p>The attached Schedule II draft has been drawn up in accordance with the
                            views on the concessions which might be granted Haiti, as already made
                            known informally to the Haitian Minister and Mr. de la Rue by Mr.
                            Welles.</p>
                        <p>The general provisions of the attached draft agreement represent the
                            views of the United States Government on matters affecting trade in
                            general between the United States and Haiti. Their aim is to reduce or
                            eliminate wherever possible such barriers as may exist, or as might be
                            likely to arise, to the trade between the two countries. It is
                            understood that the Government of the United States reserves the
                            privilege of suggesting such changes in these provisions as may on
                            further consideration seem desirable, prior to their final approval by
                            both Governments.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States will be pleased to receive the views
                            of the Government of Haiti concerning the attached draft agreement and
                            the two Schedules included therein.</p>

                        <p>133. For Welles. Hibbert<note n="43" xml:id="d343fn43">Lucien Hibbert was
                                appointed Haitian Secretary of State for Foreign Relations on
                                December 24, 1934.</note> has just informed me that he does not see
                            how Haiti can sign the trade agreement; that as drafted, Haiti makes
                            concessions that will entail a loss estimated at 2 percent of their
                            total revenues in return for possible future benefits, the amount of
                            which cannot now be determined, and a reduction of 50 percent duty on
                            rum of which all other rum producing countries will benefit.</p>
                        <p>The whole basis of the treaty, he feels, is entirely contrary to the
                            ideas underlying the Washington conversations when it was decided that
                            an attempt must be made to even the present unfavorable trade balance
                            between the two countries. The agreement proposed would give the
                            impression to any impartial observer, he thinks, that it is the United
                            States that has been buying 60 percent of Haitian exports and furnishing
                            only 6 percent of Haitian imports instead of the contrary being the
                            case. The Government could not, in the circumstances, go before the
                            legislature with such an agreement without subjecting itself to severe
                            criticism.</p>
                        <p>I told Hibbert that I thought the Haitian Government might have reached
                            this conclusion earlier, for example when Blanchet was here. He pointed
                            out that he took office only last Monday and admits that he has had
                            little time as yet to study the question but hopes to have certain
                            counterproposals to make at an early date. My own impression is that
                            lard is the real point at issue. De la Rue will explain its peculiar
                            significance here economically as well as politically. I shall cable you
                            further tomorrow. Please inform De la Rue.</p>

                        <p>134. Legation’s telegram number 133, December 28, 2 p.m. for Welles. I
                            have just come from the Minister for Foreign Affairs who desires to
                            submit informally the following proposals with regard to the trade
                            agreement. His memorandum contains two propositions: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <list>
                                    <item>“1. Whenever the laws of the United States shall authorize
                                        the extension to Haiti of an annual quota of 10,000 tons of
                                        sugar the reductions in duties envisaged in articles 11033,
                                        12420, 12423, 13007 shall become immediately
                                        effective.</item>
                                    <item>2. From the date when the exportation to the United States
                                        of rum, sugar, bananas, and other Haitian products shall
                                        represent 40 percent of the Haitian exports during any
                                        Haitian fiscal year the reduction in duty envisaged in
                                        article 12011 shall immediately enter into force.”</item>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The Minister added that the treaty was acceptable with the exceptions
                            named above.</p>
                        <p>It is my impression that the figures mentioned in Hibbert’s memorandum if
                            not acceptable might be subject to downward revision.</p>
                        <p>Hibbert further authorized me to state that his Government had studied
                            the situation resulting from Japanese dumping and that they are
                            preparing legislation for submission to the next session of the
                            Legislature which would enable the textile and other industries of the
                            United States, Great Britain and France to regain the Haitian
                            markets.</p>
                        <p>The Minister concluded by saying that he was equally anxious with the
                            Department to see trade agreement concluded as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>Pixley was present at the interview. Please show the above to De la

                        <p>99. Your 133, December 28, 2 p.m. Following for your information and
                            guidance. We had conference with Blanchet this morning (De la Rue
                            present) in which Blanchet read instructions from Hibbert expressing the
                            viewpoint set out in your telegram.</p>
                        <p>We said to Blanchet frankly that we were astonished that after these
                            months of negotiations and after the 3 weeks he had recently spent in
                            Haiti for the purpose of discussing the proposed trade agreement <pb
                                n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0398"/>personally with President
                            Vincent we should now receive such a message from the Haitian
                            Government. We stated, as we had explained to him carefully throughout
                            the negotiations, that the benefits which Haiti will receive under the
                            most-favored-nation clause are not as Hibbert seems to feel “indefinite”
                            and “uncertain”, but on the contrary definite and certain and will
                            accrue to Haiti within a relatively short time as the result of
                            negotiation of trade agreements between the United States and other
                            countries. We said that the point of view expressed in Hibbert’s
                            telegram appeared to be the familiar narrow one of seeking immediate
                            small advantages, whereas, from the outset of our negotiations with
                            Haiti we had stressed, with the entire approval of the Haitian
                            Government, the necessity of putting into effect the broad liberal
                            program approved by both Haiti and the United States at the Montevideo
                            Conference of reducing tariff barriers and thus bringing about a general
                            increase in international trade, which would be mutually beneficial to
                            the two countries. We said that the only possible explanation we could
                            find for the instructions from Hibbert were that the latter, having just
                            assumed office, had obviously not had an opportunity to familiarize
                            himself with the many reports made by Blanchet during this long period
                            of negotiation. We said that if the Haitian Government desires to submit
                            counter proposals we hope that they will do so at the earliest possible
                            moment, and that we shall, of course, be glad to give them favorable
                            consideration. On the other hand, if the Haitian Government feels that
                            it cannot conclude a trade agreement on the bases which we have for so
                            long discussed then we trust that the Haitian Government will so advise
                            us immediately in order that we can abandon these negotiations and
                            proceed with negotiations with other countries which have been pressing
                            us to enter into trade agreements. We asked Blanchet to cable the
                            foregoing to his Government.</p>

                                Representative of the Republic of Haiti.</note> informs me that the
                            Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance agreed informally yesterday at
                            a conference with the French Minister to propose to General Receiver a
                            plan initiated by local French Chamber of Commerce to convert value of
                            French imports into gourdes at gold parity for the purpose of computing
                            ad valorem duties rather than at current exchange rates as at present in
                            order to remove handicap on imports from France due to decreased
                            exchange value of gourde. The French Minister recognized that the plan
                            would have to be extended [to] all gold countries. The French Minister
                            stated that his Government is about to negotiate a new commercial treaty
                            with Haiti and unless present trade handicap is relieved France will
                            eliminate most-favored-nation clause.</p>
                        <p>The plan fails to take into account recent price increases in American
                            merchandise against which the French frankly admitted their plan is
                            directed. The plan actually would reduce customs duties requiring action
                            under Article 9 of the Treaty of 1915. Pixley feels considerable
                            pressure will be exerted on his office by the Government during the next
                            few days to force adoption of the plan. For this reason it is hoped that
                            the Department will give the matter its immediate attention and let the
                            Legation have its decision on what answer should be made. As it is
                            understood that De la Rue<note n="46" xml:id="d347fn46">Sidney de la
                                Rue, Fiscal Representative of the Republic of Haiti.</note> is now
                            in Washington the Department probably will wish to consult him.</p>
                        <pb n="334" xml:id="pg_334" facs="0400"/>
                        <p>Pixley feels that while this last French proposal is of local origin and
                            does not emanate from the French Foreign Office, nevertheless, the
                            danger presented by the French threat to bar Haitian coffee unless its
                            demands are met is sufficiently serious to justify a careful examination
                            as to possibilities offered by the American market for Haitian coffee;
                            that full information on this question at any rate would be required
                            during discussions with the French.</p>

                                <item>Using the present exchange rates it is estimated that the
                                    operation of the French plan would have reduced last year’s
                                    revenues by 200,000 gourdes. Further decline in the gold value
                                    of the dollar will increase the reduction and might also induce
                                    larger shipments from gold countries thus accelerating the loss.
                                    Uncertainties are too great to permit an estimate of the
                                    probable loss of revenue under the plan.</item>

                                <item>In the conference the French Minister made no reference to
                                    last year’s coffee quota. His threats were indefinite, although
                                    he specifically mentioned withdrawal of most-favored-nation

                            French Commercial Attaché regarding the commercial relations between
                            France and Haiti. He found the attitude of the Ambassador most
                            sympathetic. The Ambassador had said that the recent suggestion of the
                            French Chamber of Commerce in Haiti to calculate duties on imports from
                            France on a gold basis had come from the French Commercial Attaché in
                            Habana. The Ambassador felt that this Commercial Attaché had gone too
                            far in the matter.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador said that he would send to his Government a memorandum
                            recommending that France should maintain the <hi rend="italic">status
                                quo</hi> as regards coffee quotas for Haiti. Also, that France
                            should work out a plan with Haiti which would define articles of
                            specific French origin and of which France furnishes the major part of
                            Haiti’s imports and endeavor to obtain tariff reductions on such
                            articles from Haiti, which Haiti could generalize to other countries
                            under the most-favored-nation clause. Mr. de la Rue said that he thought
                            the French Ambassador was taking a broad gauge and friendly attitude
                            towards the relations between Haiti and France and that his
                            recommendations to the French Government would be extremely helpful from
                            the point of view of Haiti without prejudicing the normal trade
                            interests of the United States in Haiti.</p>

                            4. We have discussed the matter with De la Rue and desire you to
                            instruct Pixley to inform the Minister of Finance that (1) any such
                            arrangement if agreed to would unbalance the budget to the extent that
                            customs receipts would be reduced; furthermore such an arrangement would
                            have to apply equally to all gold countries enjoying most-favored-nation
                            treatment. An unbalanced budget would require a corresponding increase
                            in revenues from other sources. (2) It would also seem unwise to make
                            any arrangement in advance of proposed commercial treaty negotiations
                            with France without assurance of an adequate coffee quota. (3) The
                            present law prohibits any such arrangement unless modified by the
                            Legislature.</p>

                        <p>13. As a result of insistent demands by the French Government that Haiti
                            do something to concentrate [<hi rend="italic">compensate?</hi>] the
                            present unfavorable trade balance (the French [Government?] has even
                            threatened to place a quota on Haitian coffee unless these demands are
                            met), the Haitian Government has agreed to conclude a new commercial
                            convention between the two countries whereby in exchange for a minimum
                            tariff on Haitian coffee and a quota of 30,000,000 kilograms per annum
                            the Haitian Government agrees to apply the rates in effect prior to 1926
                            on the following importations from France: wines in barrels gourdes
                            .073, wines in bottles gourdes .432, sparkling wines gourdes 1.00,
                            champagne gourdes 1.885, vermouth and aperitifs of specified brands
                            gourdes 1.32, cognacs, armagnacs and liqueurs of specified brands
                            gourdes 2.171. All taxes per liter.</p>
                        <p>Medicinal and mineral waters are to enter without duty. Perfumes, toilet
                            waters, lotions and dentifrices of specified brands will pay 10 per cent
                            ad valorem. Pharmaceutical products of specified brands 18 per cent ad
                            valorem. The loss in revenue to the Haitian State if these duties had
                            been in effect last year would have been approximately gourdes 140,000.
                            With the view not to affect the mostfavored-nation treatment principle
                            the document has been so worded as to apply only to named specialties of
                            French origin. In view of <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337" facs="0403"/>the
                            fact that Haiti sells practically its entire coffee crop to France and
                            will by the above convention be able to insure this market at such
                            little loss to its customs revenues, which may even be compensated in
                            part by increased importations of the articles affected, I have informed
                            the Fiscal Representative of my approval of the reduced rates. I have
                            done so without referring the matter to the Department. As stated,
                            question is an urgent one and in such talks which only Fiscal
                            Representative and I have had with officials in the Department we have
                            received the distinct impression that the Department was in agreement
                            that Haiti must be prepared to defend itself against this very real
                            threat to its economic existence by making the best bargain it could.
                            All things considered I feel that the terms by which it has been able to
                            secure continuance of its coffee exports to France are reasonable.</p>
                        <p>There is the further question that the legal adviser to the Fiscal
                            Representative does not consider that this agreement can legally be put
                            into effect until ratified by the Legislature unless an emergency can be
                            shown to exist. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance, however,
                            insist that it must be made effective immediately, as otherwise there is
                            a grave danger that the French will make further demands or retaliate
                            with a coffee quota. The Fiscal Representative is, however, reluctant to
                            put the new rates into effect without authorization from the Legation. I
                            have told him that I will grant such authorization if or when the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that in the opinion of the
                            Haitian Government an emergency exists such as to justify the immediate
                            putting into effect of the tariff reductions pending ratification by the
                            Legislature, and that the Legation will submit the agreement for
                            approval by the Legislature immediately upon its convening in April.</p>

                            take steps to compensate its unfavorable trade balance and has recently
                            acted to prevent Haitian coffee from selling in Italy as freely as in
                            the past. According to available figures for the current fiscal year
                            Haiti has purchased from Italy 600,000 lire worth of goods and has sold
                            to Italy an amount worth 12,000,000 lire.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Government has decided to treat the matter as an urgent one
                            as Italy is its market for quality coffee and has agreed to add a new
                            protocol to the commercial convention already existing between the two
                                countries<note n="50" xml:id="d356fn50">Convention signed January 3,
                                1927, League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                    >lxxi</hi>, p. 405.</note> whereby in exchange for a minimum
                            tariff for an annual quota of 5,000,000 kilograms of Haitian coffee
                            Haiti will apply a reduction of 33⅓ percent on existing tariff rates on
                            the following importations from Italy: Marble, alabaster, olive oil,
                            vermouth, cheese, canned tomatoes, buttons, umbrellas, hats, and
                            caps.</p>
                        <p>The loss in revenue to the Haitian state if these duties had been in
                            effect last year would have been approximately $8000.</p>
                        <p>The wording of the present draft of agreement, which I am sending to the
                            Department by air mail tomorrow, would seem to me to afford
                            most-favored-nation treatment to those countries, including the United
                            States, which are already entitled to such treatment. <pb n="339"
                                xml:id="pg_339" facs="0405"/>Pixley, the Acting Fiscal
                            Representative, agrees with me in this interpretation; but, as the
                            intention of the Italian Government is presumably to favor its trade,
                            the wording of the final text may be so changed as to make the one-third
                            rate reduction apply only to named specialties of Italian origin.</p>
                        <p>Acting on the precedent established by the Department’s approval of the
                            Haitian-French agreement of last February (the Legation’s telegram No.
                            13, February 20, 1 p.m., and the Department’s No. 10 [<hi rend="italic"
                                >9</hi>], February 24, 10 a.m.), and in view of the fact that Haiti
                            sells 10 percent of its coffee crop to Italy and will by the above
                            agreement be able to insure this market at such little loss to its
                            customs revenues, I have informed the Acting Fiscal Representative of
                            the Legation’s approval of the reduced rates.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that, at the President’s request, I called on him at the Palace this
                            morning. He told me that his attention had been called to a report
                            appearing in one of the Dominican papers to the effect that the
                            Secretary of State would probably return from Panama to New York by way
                            of the Antilles, his boat probably touching at Haiti. The President
                            asked me whether I had any confirmation of this report and I told him
                            that I had not but that I had rather assumed that the Secretary would
                            remain on board the same ship until his arrival in New York and that I
                            understood that the ship’s schedule did not call for a stop at Haiti.
                            However, I told the President that I would be glad to communicate with
                            the Department and ascertain whether there was any foundation in the
                            report.</p>
                        <p>The President then went on to say that he had been thinking over the
                            matter of a refunding loan for some time and that he expected, after the
                            Secretary’s return, to take up the matter in Washington with a view to
                            seeing what could be done in this respect. He made the observation that
                            Mr. Spruille Braden, a member of the American delegation to the Pan
                            American Conference who, he understood, was the member of the delegation
                            primarily interested in financial matters, had assured members of the
                            Haitian delegation that a refunding loan for an amount sufficient to
                            take care of the present situation here should not be difficult to
                            secure. The President said that what he would like to do would be to
                            obtain a refunding loan sufficient to yield $3,000,000 over the amount
                            actually required for refunding purposes, this surplus to be devoted to
                            public works and other necessary projects, a detailed list of which
                            would be drawn up and presented to the bankers before the loan was made.
                            This would enable the Haitian Government to devote its entire revenues
                            to regular budgetary purposes <pb n="341" xml:id="pg_341" facs="0407"
                            />including service on such a loan. The President felt that, if a fairly
                            long term loan could be secured, the amortization payments could be kept
                            low enough not to have the loan service a drain on the public treasury.
                            With the development of the various projects now under study, notably
                            the banana scheme, he felt that the economic stability of the country
                            would be assured. Furthermore, he realized more and more that the
                            economic and financial future of Haiti lay in the direction of the
                            United States and he was most anxious that the refunding operation
                            should be put through in the United States. If this could be done, he
                            proposed himself to visit the United States to complete the final
                            negotiations and at that time would like to visit the President. He felt
                            that such a meeting, which could be accompanied by a statement
                            announcing the application of the doctrine of the “good neighbor” to
                            Haiti, would have an extremely good effect not only on relations between
                            the two countries but throughout Latin America, particularly if, at the
                            same time, the announcement could be made that Haiti and the United
                            States were prepared to enter into a treaty of amity and commerce based
                            upon the new spirit which animated President Roosevelt’s
                            administration.</p>
                        <p>While I did not commit myself other than to say that I knew that our
                            Government would be very glad to lend its good offices, as stated by
                            President Roosevelt, I must confess that I feel that if a refunding loan
                            could be secured in the United States, particularly through the good
                            offices of our Government, some such procedure as that suggested by
                            President Vincent might be used with telling effect in following up the
                            excellent impression that seems everywhere to have been created by the
                            attitude shown by our delegation at Montevideo. As to the feasibility of
                            a refunding loan at the present time, the Department is, of course, in a
                            better position than the Legation to judge.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, I took the occasion to say to the President that, without
                            wishing to seem to offer gratuitous advice, there were two points which
                            I should like very much to stress to him. First, with regard to the
                            Garde, I had noticed an increasing tendency, both in the press and among
                            individuals with whom I had spoken, to stress the necessity of a largely
                            increased Garde and the purchase of equipment for it. I said that if he
                            really hoped to secure a refunding loan along the lines suggested he
                            must convince American bankers of the soundness of Haiti as a financial
                            investment and that I could think of no worse way to go about this than
                            to give the impression that, once American influence was withdrawn, the
                            Government would divert the revenues, which were badly needed in
                            developing the economic resources of the country, into military
                            channels. What Haiti needed, in my opinion, was a police force adequate
                            to maintain law and order in the country and that anything that went
                            beyond that point <pb n="342" xml:id="pg_342" facs="0408"/>could only be
                            interpreted abroad as indicating an attitude of nervousness and
                            apprehension on the part of the Government which apprehension would be
                            certain to be communicated to those abroad whom they were seeking to
                            convince as to the stability of the country. Secondly, while I naturally
                            had no information as to what guaranties would be required by any
                            banking group, should a refunding loan be seriously considered, I felt
                            that if the Haitian Government could introduce the “douzième” principle
                            into its budget structure this would be one of the most constructive and
                            reassuring evidences of financial responsibility that they could give. I
                            pointed out that, while on paper, perhaps, the plan he had so often
                            suggested to me, by which his government would give irrevocable
                            instructions to the National Bank with regard to payments under the loan
                            service, seemed perfectly secure, nevertheless, we had seen both in
                            Salvador and the Dominican Republic how, even though perhaps acting in
                            perfectly good faith, a Government might get itself into financial
                            difficulties through a faulty budget structure and I ventured to suggest
                            that, if the Haitian Government would take such a step, this would do
                            more than any one thing to create a feeling of confidence in Haiti’s
                            financial future.</p>
                        <p>The President took my remarks in very good part and with every evidence
                            of sincerity assured me that he could see no reason why both these
                            suggestions should not be carried out. With regard to the Garde he said
                            that they had every intention of maintaining the Garde at its present
                            approximate strength although it would be necessary to purchase a
                            certain amount of equipment at the time the Haitianization was completed
                            as they had hitherto been dependent on the equipment loaned by the
                            American Government.</p>
                        <p>The Fiscal Representative, Mr. de la Rue, told me this morning of a talk
                            which he had had with the Minister of Finance, M. Hibbert, which
                            followed very much the same lines as the President’s talk with me. M.
                            Hibbert, however, was more specific in giving the details as to the
                            procedure which the Haitian Government proposed to follow in securing a
                            refunding loan. One of these details of some importance which the
                            President had not mentioned to me was that the Haitian Government would
                            accept the offer of the National City Bank and would itself take over
                            the National Bank but would keep it under the management of the bank or
                            consortion through which the refunding loan might be made. I am
                            enclosing a copy of a memorandum prepared for me by Mr. de la Rue<note
                                n="56" xml:id="d359fn56">Not printed.</note> covering his talk with
                            M. Hibbert.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that, in his letter to me, Mr. de la Rue states that M.
                            Hibbert told him the President would like to have him, Mr. de la Rue, go
                            up to the United States in connection not only with preliminary <pb
                                n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0409"/>work looking toward a loan but
                            also with certain other problems, notably, the commercial treaty,<note
                                n="57" xml:id="d359fn57">See <ref target="#pg_308">pp. 308</ref>
                                ff.</note> the freight rate situation, et cetera. Mr. de la Rue
                            replied that a request to this effect would have to be made by the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Legation to which M. Hibbert replied
                            he would see that this was done.</p>
                        <p>In order to avoid possible delay I should appreciate hearing from the
                            Department what its views with regard to this proposal may be.
                            Personally, I am of the opinion that Mr. de la Rue’s presence in the
                            United States at this time might be very useful and I earnestly request
                            that every consideration be given to this suggestion.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing that has occurred recently to change the opinion I have
                            expressed in previous despatches that, after October next,<note n="58"
                                xml:id="d359fn58">The agreement of August 7, 1933, provided that the
                                withdrawal of the Marine Brigade of the United States would commence
                                October 1, 1934, and was to be completed within 30 days.</note> it
                            will become more and more difficult to secure Haitian cooperation in
                            executing the financial clauses contained in the Accord of August 7 and,
                            if there is any possibility that our Government’s participation in
                            Haitian financial matters could be terminated prior to that time through
                            a refunding loan, I feel that every effort should be made to this
                            end.</p>
                        <p>I shall not fail to keep the Department fully informed regarding further
                            developments along these lines.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            Vincent dated November 23, 1933, to the National City Bank acknowledging
                            the Bank’s letter of November 8, 1933, offering to sell the Banque
                            Nationale de la République d’Haiti to the Haitian Government, in which
                            President Vincent expresses thanks for the offer and asks for a period
                            of one year for its consideration; and a letter from the National City
                            Bank to President Vincent dated December 29, 1933, extending the offer
                            to sell the Banque Nationale until December 1, 1934, subject to the
                            withdrawal of this option on ninety days notice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lancaster said that the Bank had recently received a request from the
                            Haitian Government to explore the possibilities of a refunding <pb

                            this request but had not yet received any replies. He said, in effect:
                            “I do not think there is much likelihood of doing anything under present

                        <p>The Minister of Haiti called and stated that some of the officials in his
                            country had represented that I had told the Haitian Delegation in
                            Montevideo that just as soon as I returned to Washington I would take up
                            and remove the conditions which entangled the United States Government
                            with the Haitian Government financially and otherwise. I told the
                            Minister that in the first place I had suggested and urged upon the
                            Haitian Delegation that if their government would be disposed to do some
                            new financing, so as to take up the present outstanding securities
                            against Haiti, I and other United States officials would lend all moral
                            support to this new financing just so we did not involve ourselves or
                            our government. I stated that this would settle the matter and enable
                            the United States Government to withdraw entirely from Haiti. I added
                            that the Haitian Government now only had an external debt of 11 million
                            dollars, while it had annual receipts of 6½ million dollars, and,
                            therefore, that it should be able to do this financing which would solve
                            this entire entanglement matter which I deplored as much as anybody and
                            from which my government was extremely anxious to release itself.</p>
                        <p>The Haitian Delegation at Montevideo went away apparently pleased with
                            this suggestion, but a few days later they returned and wanted to know
                            if some other method of disentanglement could not be arrived at. I again
                            repeated the anxious desire of my government to get released from this
                            special relationship with Haiti which arose many years ago, and that in
                            every possible way at the earliest possible date the United States
                            Government would take steps to disentangle itself. I then added that, of
                            course, at that time being many thousand miles away from the records in
                            the matter, I could not possibly know what contractual obligations had
                            been entered into by the United States Government and Haiti which might
                            hinder and delay the removal of these involvements by any other method
                            than that of new financing, but that as soon as I returned to Washington
                            I would undertake to go over the entire records and see what the
                            contractual obligations were and in any event would work out and develop
                            every possible step that could now be taken without violating our solemn
                            contractual obligations, and that we were as anxious as they to take
                            such steps.</p>

                            that the Fiscal Representative, Mr. de la Rue, informed me this morning
                            that, from recent conversations he has had with M. Hibbert, the Minister
                            of Finance, Mr. Laleau, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and others, he
                            understands that the President will probably shortly take up with me the
                            possibility of having Mr. de la Rue proceed to the United States in
                            connection with negotiations looking toward a bilateral commercial
                            treaty between Haiti and the United States along the lines of those
                            recently concluded by the United States with Colombia and certain other
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>As I have pointed out to the Department in previous despatches, I feel
                            that Mr. de la Rue’s presence in the United States, both in connection
                            with such a commercial treaty and, even more particularly, in connection
                            with a possible refunding loan along the lines suggested in the
                            President’s letter to President Vincent, might be very useful. In fact,
                            I have every reason to believe that one of the principal purposes the
                            Haitian Government would have in mind in sending him to the United
                            States would be in connection with a refunding loan along the lines
                            recently set forth by M. Hibbert, the Minister of Finance, to Mr. de la
                            Rue. (See enclosure<note n="60" xml:id="d362fn60">Not printed.</note> to
                            the Legation’s despatch No. 238 of January 16, 1934.)</p>
                        <p>The Haitian delegation to the Pan American Conference has now returned
                            and the press has announced that its report will shortly be published
                            but, from what I have been told by the President and the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, I judge that there has been little change in the
                            situation since that described in previous despatches and that the
                            Haitian Government is still counting upon the good offices of the
                            American Government in helping it to secure a refunding loan.</p>
                        <p>With a somewhat uncertain internal political situation resulting from a
                            recrudescence—or perhaps it would be more accurate to say
                            continuation—of the ill feeling between the President and the majority
                            of the Senate, I am afraid that the next regular session of the
                            Legislature in April will bring matters to a head and the more that can
                            be done before that time to establish a definite policy with regard to
                            future financial control the better. Just two months remain before the
                            opening of this session and I feel very strongly that the sooner the
                            possibilities of a refunding loan can be thoroughly explored, or any
                            other new mechanism tending to clarify the situation considered, the
                            better.</p>
                        <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0412"/>
                        <p>I should therefore appreciate receiving by telegraph an indication of the
                            Department’s views with regard to having Mr. de la Rue proceed to the
                            United States should the Haitian Government indicate a desire to have
                            him do so.</p>

                        <p>11. The President called for me this morning and told me that he was most
                            anxious to begin exploring the possibilities of a refunding loan. He
                            said that Blanchet has instructions to take up the matter with the
                            President but asked me to stress the importance he attached to an early
                            decision as to what course to pursue. He added that as soon as things
                            seemed to be under way he would like to come up himself to the United
                            States quite informally for a talk with the President as he felt that
                            through such personal contacts with him and with the Secretary all
                            existing difficulties could be ironed out. If a refunding loan proved
                            possible and the withdrawal of financial control within sight then he
                            felt that the occasion of his visit could be used to announce the
                            opening of negotiations looking towards a treaty of amity and commerce.
                            His reply to my question as to when he would wish to make such a visit
                            was somewhat vague but I judge he would plan to leave in time to return
                            to Haiti for the opening of the regular session of the Legislature,
                            April 2nd.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                            note of January 12, 1934, informing me that you had been instructed by
                            your Government to negotiate an arrangement with a view to terminating
                            the financial administration now exercised in Haiti under the provisions
                            of the Agreement of August 7, 1933.</p>
                        <p>In the statement which I made to the Haitian Delegation on board the S.
                            S. <hi rend="italic">American Legion</hi> on November 27, 1933, I stated
                            that the American Government would agree to and would welcome an
                            arrangement which would result in withdrawal of American governmental
                            action in financial control in Haiti, and that the American Government
                            would be ready to accept an arrangement along such lines if worked out
                                <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0413"/>in agreement with the
                            present bondholders. I said that it would be preferable for the Haitian
                            Government to approach the Fiscal Agents in regard to putting such a
                            plan in effect, rather than for the American Government to take the
                            initiative to that end. I added that the American Government would be
                            glad to lend its good offices in the matter in any way that would not
                            involve it in any further responsibilities in Haiti. Furthermore, in the
                            letter addressed to President Vincent on November 29, 1933, President
                            Roosevelt said that <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Under Article XXVI of the Agreement of August 7 last, Haiti,
                                    with the approval of the United States, reserved the right to
                                    retire the bonds before their due date provided she could make
                                    an arrangement for this purpose satisfactory to the holders of
                                    the bonds. The United States Government would be glad to lend
                                    its good offices in the matter in any way which would not
                                    involve it in any further responsibilities in Haiti.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As I explained to the Haitian Delegation, a refunding operation which
                            would retire the present bonds in agreement with the bondholders, and
                            which would not involve the American Government in any further
                            responsibilities in Haiti, would appear to be the first and most logical
                            move for the solution so much desired by both the Haitian and the
                            American Governments, namely, the withdrawal of American financial
                            control in Haiti. In this connection, I should be pleased to learn what
                            steps your Government is taking to explore the possibility of a
                            refunding operation. This Government will, as already stated, be glad to
                            lend its good offices in the matter in any way that will not involve it
                            in any further responsibilities in Haiti.</p>

                                xml:id="d366fn62">Not printed.</note> the present arrangement of the
                            Haitian Government is to have De la Rue sail for the United States
                            February 22 to explore the possibilities of a refunding loan. He will,
                            however, proceed directly to Washington and put himself in touch with
                            the Haitian Minister to whom instructions have been sent and who will be
                            prepared to open negotiations with the fiscal agents if and when matters
                            have reached that stage.</p>
                        <p>I now feel, and hope the Department will agree, that this procedure
                            represents the most practicable one, as it would seem essential for the
                            best interests of all concerned that someone with De la Rue’s knowledge
                            should be on hand to advise Blanchet who will, however, be in a position
                            to make clear the desires of the Haitian Government with regard to a
                            refunding loan and the terms which they are prepared to offer to obtain
                            it.</p>

                            President Vincent issued April 17 to the Press after their meeting at
                            the White House: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“We have had an opportunity to discuss in the most friendly and
                                    cordial manner the different problems arising in the relations
                                    between the Governments of the United States and of Haiti.</p>
                                <p>“In connection with the departure of the United States Marines
                                    from Haiti during the month of October, next, as already
                                    provided in the Agreement of August 7, 1933, President Roosevelt
                                    intends to request authority from the Congress of the United
                                    States to make a gift to Haiti of a portion of the Marine Corps
                                    material which the Haitian Government feels would be useful to
                                        it.<note n="66" xml:id="d369fn66">See <ref target="#pg_293"

                                <p>“We have exchanged views regarding the possibility of a
                                    commercial agreement which would increase the flow of goods
                                    between the two countries; and finally we have discussed a new
                                    form of financial administration which is satisfactory to our
                                    two Governments and which should be equally satisfactory to the
                                    holders of the bonds of the 1922 loan.</p>
                                <p>“We are both inclined to the belief that the policy of the good

                                    endeavoring to apply in its relations with the other American
                                    Republics will be signally manifested in the results which will
                                    be obtained from this exchange of views and from negotiations
                                    which are now taking place with a view to the practical
                                    application of the decisions reached in principle during our
                                    present conversations.</p>
                                <p>“Certainly Haiti will now be in a position to look forward to her
                                    future with the greatest confidence.”</p>

                        <p>21. Hibbert left here this morning by airplane for Miami and Port au
                            Prince.</p>
                        <p>We understand that agreement has practically been reached on the terms of
                            the contract for purchase of Bank satisfactory to the Haitian
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The procedure contemplated at the time you left Washington has been
                            modified in view of Hibbert’s opinion that it would run counter <pb
                                n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0419"/>to Haitian constitutional
                            provisions, which Hibbert will doubtless explain to you.</p>
                        <p>The procedure now tentatively contemplated is the following: <list>

                                <item>Letter from Haitian Government to American Legation reciting
                                    passage of this Law of Sanctions; that it is intention of
                                    Haitian Government to confer upon the Bank following powers and
                                    duties in order to insure service of 1922 loan and to maintain
                                    in force without modification these measures of security until
                                    the bonds of the 1922 loan are paid or retired; that in view of
                                    the foregoing the Haitian Government proposes the conclusion of
                                    a treaty, a draft of which would be enclosed, to which treaty
                                    this letter would be annexed as a part thereof. The measures of
                                    security described in appropriate language in the letter would
                                    be: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) provisions regarding designation

                                    authority to the Bank to control and inspect the application of

                                <item>The proposed treaty would make reference to the purchase of
                                    the Bank by the Haitian Government and to the annexed letter as
                                    described above, and would then provide simply that upon
                                    notification from the Haitian Government to the American
                                    Legation of the enactment of whatever legislative or executive
                                    measures might be required to place in effect the provisions set

                            memorandum will also be sent to the Fiscal Agents. I have forwarded
                            these documents by air mail this morning and they should reach the
                            Department Monday morning. It will be noted that the letter (marked A)
                            which is the one to be referred to in the treaty, does not set forth
                            specifically the powers listed in paragraph 2 of Department’s No. 21.
                            Hibbert explains that these powers are contained in the bank contract (a
                            procedure not perhaps envisaged by the Department at the time telegram
                            No. 21 was sent) which contract as stated in Department’s telegram No.
                            22, April 30, 1 p.m., with the bank’s concession and contracts will
                            constitute the new organic bank law as the letter engages the Haitian
                            Government not to change the terms of the contract. Hibbert does not see
                            the need of having these powers again set forth in the letter but both
                            he and Laleau have assured me that if the Department prefers that this
                            be done they will be glad to make the necessary alterations.</p>

                            We explained carefully to Hibbert that the American Government could not
                            base a treaty with the Haitian Government upon a contract between the
                            latter Government and an American banking house. We thought it was
                            clearly understood by Hibbert and De la Rue that the procedure should be
                            as set out in our 21, April 28, 3 p.m., and we feel it important that
                            this procedure be followed.</p>
                        <p>Letter “A” from the Haitian Government should set out in detail the four
                            measures of security for the bondholders mentioned in paragraph numbered
                            2 of our 21, April 28, 3 p.m., with the statement that <pb n="355"
                                xml:id="pg_355" facs="0421"/>such measures will be maintained in
                            force without modification until the bonds of the 1922 loan are paid or
                            retired; measure (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) should recite the provisions
                            regarding designation and appointment of members of the Board of
                            Directors in much the same terms as those employed in the Sales
                            Contract; measures (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) and (<hi rend="italic"
                                >c</hi>) should comprise the pertinent provisions of Article XV of
                            the Sales Contract and of the penultimate paragraph of the draft letter
                            marked “B” enclosed with your letter under acknowledgment; measure (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>) should contain provisions which in your
                            judgment and that of De la Rue are satisfactory as to the necessary
                            authority to the Bank to control and inspect the application of the
                            customs law and customs regulations; apparently such provisions are
                            suggested in the third and fifth paragraphs of the letter marked “B”
                            enclosed with your letter under acknowledgment.</p>
                        <p>The definitive letter “B” from the Haitian Government should comprise the
                            second, fourth, sixth and eighth paragraphs of the draft letter “B”
                            enclosed with your letter under acknowledgment (De la Rue should be
                            consulted as to the satisfactory form of these paragraphs) as well as
                            the statement of financial policy embodied in the memorandum enclosed
                            with your letter under acknowledgment. There would seem to be no reason
                            for sending a separate memorandum to this Government, although we agree
                            that the separate memorandum should be transmitted by the Haitian
                            Government to the Fiscal Agents and to the Foreign Bondholders
                            Protective Council.</p>
                        <p>We do not desire any phraseology used in letter “B” such as is contained
                            in the Haitian draft with reference to “permitting the United States
                            Government to be relieved of obligations assumed towards the
                            bondholders” nor any reference to the prospectus of the loan.</p>

                        <p>42. With reference to the Department’s telegram[s] No. 21, April 28, 3
                            p.m. and 25, May 7, 5 p.m. I sent to the Department yesterday by air
                            mail under cover of a personal letter to Wilson<note n="72"
                                xml:id="d373fn72">Letter dated May 10, 1934, not printed. There are
                                no enclosures attached to the original in the Department
                                files.</note> new drafts prepared by the Haitian Government of
                            letters “A” and “B” (“A” the letter to be referred to in the treaty; “B”
                            the definitive letter comprising unilateral declaration of the Haitian
                            Government). There is also enclosed (document “C”) a draft treaty
                            prepared by the Haitian Government.</p>
                        <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0422"/>
                        <p>The sales contract and law of sanction are now virtually ready for
                            signature but the President desires to discuss the questions from all
                            its angles with individual Senators and Deputies before presenting it
                            formally to the Legislature which will probably be done next Monday, May
                            14.</p>
                        <p>When he presents the contract he would like to have it accompanied
                            unofficially and for background purposes only by the two letters and
                            draft treaty in order that the Legislature may have the plan in its
                            entirety before it when it considers the contract.</p>
                        <p>The President would not wish to do this however until being assured that
                            we are in virtual agreement on the terms of both letters and if possible
                            on the text of the treaty as well. Both De la Rue and I feel that
                            letters “A” and “B” as now drafted (the Haitian Government has followed
                            closely the points set forth in the Department’s telegrams 21 and 25)
                            are satisfactory; the only change we have suggested being the raising of
                            the percentage allowed the bank for expenses in the financial
                            administration from 2 per cent to 3 per cent (see letter “A” page 2
                            paragraph 2).</p>
                        <p>In order to expedite matters, I hope that the Department will telegraph
                            (by cable) as soon as conveniently possible any comment or changes it
                            desires made together with its views as to the proposed procedure.
                            Personally, I feel that it is most important that the Legislature have
                            the entire plan before it in considering the contract.</p>
                        <p>In general, things are progressing as satisfactorily as could be
                            expected.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Confirming my telegram No. 44 of May 12, 1
                            p.m., I have the honor to inform the Department that the contract for
                            the sale of the Banque Nationale de la République d’Haiti to the Haitian
                            Government was signed on May 12. The contract, together with the law of
                            sanction, is being presented to the Chamber of Deputies by the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs, M. Laleau, today.</p>
                        <p>M. Laleau informed me that he intended to present the contract in a
                            vigorous speech calling the attention of the Deputies to the fact that
                            the plan proposed was one which they had all on many occasions insisted
                            was the one they wanted and that now to reject it would be to subject
                            themselves to the accusation of hypocrisy and bad faith.</p>
                        <p>I have called M. Laleau’s attention to the correction in letter “A”
                            mentioned in paragraph 1 of the Department’s telegram No. 28 of May 15,
                            4 p.m., regarding the substitution of the phrase, “Board of Directors of
                            the Bank,” for, “The Director of the Bank.” I have also handed him the
                            text of the proposed treaty set forth in the same telegram. <pb n="359"
                                xml:id="pg_359" facs="0425"/>He will, I understand, use these
                            documents in informal discussions with the Deputies in order that they
                            may have the whole plan before them when they come to consider and vote
                            on the bank contract and the law of sanction.</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, the resignation of two members of the Cabinet, MM.
                            Lescot and Hibbert, has been announced. As I have reported to the
                            Department, M. Hibbert is to be replaced by M. Christian Laporte while
                            Titus, the former Minister of Commerce and Justice, is replacing M.
                            Lescot as Minister of Interior and M. Brutus, former Chief of the
                            President’s private Cabinet, is to take over the portfolios of Commerce
                            and Public Works. (M. Hibbert held the combined portfolios of Finance
                            and Public Works.)</p>
                        <p>While it is hoped that this concession by the President to the opposition
                            forces will perhaps have the effect of winning them over, a strong
                            subterranean attack against the purchase of the bank, and in fact the
                            whole plan as explained to the public through the press, has developed.
                            Curiously enough, the Chamber of Deputies, which has hitherto supported
                            the President, seems to be even stronger in its opposition to the bank
                            purchase than the Senate. The Deputies, in particular, have been open in
                            charges of venality against the Government and the usual group of sordid
                            rumors that seem always ready to be launched at a time like this are
                            once more circulating. …</p>
                        <p>There is little doubt in my mind that the early opposition to the bank
                            sale was based upon a very real fear among the more seriously inclined
                            that the bank, once purchased, would become a prey to local politics but
                            the publication of the contract and the restrictions imposed therein, as
                            well as the announcement that the present personnel of the bank is to
                            continue, with the possible exception of the Director, has reassured
                            those who were honestly apprehensive.</p>
                        <p>I shall not fail to keep you fully informed of developments. In the
                            meantime, however, I fear that I must warn the Department that the
                            situation, as it appears today, is by no means settled and that there is
                            a possibility that the plan which has been evolved with so much care and
                            effort and that represents all that the most exigent Haitian could ever
                            have desired may, after all, be rejected through the selfish attitude of
                            a small group who really do not wish to see a solution to the present
                            problem. I hope that my fears may not prove justified but I feel it my
                            duty to mention this possibility in order that the Department may not be
                            taken by surprise should such an unfortunate eventuality occur.</p>

                        <p>51. Department’s telegram No. 28, May 15, 4 p.m. Haitian Government
                            agrees with preamble to our draft treaty, also article II; but suggests
                            that article I is unnecessarily redundant and prefers its text as given
                            in enclosure to my letter to Wilson of May 10.<note n="75"

                        <p>As letter “A” becomes party to treaty by incorporation through reference
                            in treaty, the provisions of the letter become supreme law of land and
                            no further measures necessary to make them so. When, therefore, the
                            letter is sent and treaty is signed and ratified everything necessary
                            will have been completed. In view of this they ask whether we will not
                            consider simplification of article I along the lines of article I of
                            their draft. Please instruct.</p>

                        <p>55. My telegram No. 52, May 22, 1 p.m. Haitian Government now desires to
                            insert in article I of the treaty immediately following the words “the
                            Protocol of October 3, 1919” the following phrase: “and the financial
                            arrangement contained in the agreement of August 7, 1933, resulting from
                            the above-mentioned protocol”, the article thereby being amended to read
                            “upon the entrance into force of the present treaty of which the
                            provisions of the aforementioned letter of May, 1934 are an integral
                            part of the Treaty of September 16, 1915, and the Protocol of October 3,
                            1919, and the financial arrangement contained in the Agreement of August
                            7, 1933, resulting from the above-mentioned protocol shall cease to have
                            effect”.</p>
                        <p>I conveyed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Department’s
                            suggestion contained in paragraph 4 of your telegram 28, May 15, 4 p.m.,
                            adding that I felt sure your suggestion that the matter be handled in
                            this way was to obviate possible legislative criticism that they had
                            never approved or taken official cognizance of the accord. The Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs, however, assures me that they can handle such
                            criticism and insists that Haitian Government would prefer to have the
                            phrase referred to included in the treaty. Please instruct.</p>

                            312, May 16, and 321, May 30.<note n="77" xml:id="d386fn77">Despatch No.
                                321 not printed.</note> Committee of Chamber of Deputies appointed
                            to examine project has decided unanimously in favor of principle of
                            contract but is still discussing its terms. Just when committee will
                            make its report to Chamber and the debate on the floor will begin is not
                            yet certain. After action by Chamber project must go to Senate.</p>
                        <p>Bank here recently received telegram from Lancaster indicating that if
                            Haitian Government made request for reasonable extension of time
                            (contract calls for approval by the legislature before June 1) he
                            thought request would probably be granted although he could not say so
                            definitely until matter had been submitted to proper officials.</p>
                        <p>President Vincent informed me yesterday that Haitian Government is asking
                            the bank for 3 months’ extension of time in which to enable the
                            Legislature to finish discussion and he hopes vote contract.</p>
                        <p>There now seems to be little likelihood of favorable action by the
                            Legislature prior to adjournment of our Congress. I presume, however,
                            that our offer to conclude a treaty will hold good if the Haitian
                            Legislature eventually passes the law of sanction although of course no
                            action could be taken under the treaty until our Senate took action. I
                            should, however, appreciate Department’s views on this point.<note

                            accede to the request which it has received from Haiti to extend option
                            for purchase of National Bank of Haiti beyond June 1, but is cabling De
                            la Rue to ask his opinion whether as a matter of tactics it would not be
                            advisable to limit such extension at this time to 30 days.</p>

                                    of us have consulted together this morning. We think 60 days
                                    should be sufficient but may not be and in view of complications
                                    changing fixed date all recommend 90 days extension.<note n="81"

                                    suggest that difficulty in making audit, preparing transfer, et
                                    cetera, if passage delayed in September, justifies strong
                                    representation in communicating accord agreeing to 90 days
                                    urging passage at earliest date possible. Government’s position
                                    has improved although opinions still very mixed as to chance of
                                    ratification but believe that every assistance should be given

                            single copy of the report of the Committee of the Chamber of
                                Deputies<note n="82" xml:id="d389fn1">Not printed.</note> appointed
                            to study the contract for the purchase of the National Bank of
                            Haiti.</p>
                        <p>The report, which was submitted to the Chamber on June 22, contains a
                            recommendation that the principle of the contract be adopted, although
                            three of the five members signed the report with reservations. The first
                            three pages are devoted to a general discussion of the desirability of
                            state ownership of banking institutions and the remainder to enumeration
                            of the various changes in the terms of the contract which the committee
                            recommends. It is understood that these changes represent substantially
                            those included in the modified contract, a copy of which was forwarded
                            to the Department with the Legation’s despatch No. 340 of June 20,<note
                                n="82" xml:id="d389fn2">Not printed.</note> with the principal
                            exception that the committee has recommended that under Article 5 the
                            Government will designate three directors rather than two. However, I
                            have been informed personally by the President that he will not consent
                            to this change as he recognizes that it would constitute a change in the
                            substance of the contract. The Department will note that this change was
                            not incorporated in the text of the modified contract which was
                            forwarded with the despatch referred to.</p>

                            without the Senate having reported the bank contract out of the
                            committee appointed to consider it. The pretext given for refusal to
                            vote even on the principle of the contract as the Government had hoped
                            they would do was that they must await the meeting of the stockholders
                            September 9 to ratify the sale of the bank.</p>
                        <p>Just what will be the next step is somewhat uncertain. In a talk with the
                            President he told me that he was still undecided as to whether to call
                            special session in late October or to have the matter put up to the
                            nation as a whole through a plebiscite. I have urged him against this
                            second course as outlined in my despatch 403 of August 29.<note n="82"

                                xml:id="pg_369" facs="0435"/>Minister for Foreign Affairs tells me
                            today that he feels reasonably certain the President will put the
                            contract up squarely to the Legislature in a special session called for
                            that purpose in late October. Whether the President will present the
                            contract as signed with the bank or will ask the bank to agree to
                            reasonable modifications that he, the President, feels will make it more
                            acceptable to the Legislature has not, I think, been decided upon.</p>
                        <p>I shall be in Washington Tuesday morning September 10. Please repeat the
                            substance of the above to De la Rue.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that in a
                            conversation yesterday with M. Laleau, Minister of Foreign Affairs, I
                            asked whether there was any news concerning an extra session of the
                            legislature for the consideration of the bank sale contract, to which he
                            replied in the negative. He added that the Government was waiting until
                            hearing more from Washington and New York before taking a decision, and
                            that <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0436"/>in his opinion the best
                            thing to do would be to let the whole question drop until next April,
                            the date of the opening of the regular session of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>I told him that in my personal opinion such a long delay seemed
                            unnecessary, although I agreed with him that judging by the recent turn
                            of events a rest seemed to be needed for awhile. We discussed the
                            article which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Matin</hi> of September
                            17th, reading in part as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“Information from private sources which has come to us leads us
                                    to believe that the American Government during the first half of

                                    Haiti, in a sense favorable to our dignity and interest,”</p>

                                    all participation in the administration of Haitian finance,
                                    which I feel represents the limit to which my Government can
                                    properly go, and yet remain faithful to its obligations, may
                                    prove acceptable, and that following the conclusion of a new
                                    treaty putting an end to those now in existence, we may in the
                                    future be bound only by those ties of friendship and mutual
                                    beneficial economic intercourse which should unite friendly and
                                    neighboring republics.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It seems difficult to believe that after all that has been said and done,
                            the attitude reflected in the <hi rend="italic">Matin</hi> could still
                            exist, but such is unfortunately the case.</p>
                        <p>M. Laleau touched upon a condition which undoubtedly has some bearing on
                            the matter, namely, that politicians and others who oppose the President
                            are too often credited with a “corner” on honesty, while those who are
                            friendly are generally looked upon with suspicion, as it is thought that
                            they adopt this friendly attitude for favors received. This is perhaps
                            the inevitable boomerang when money plays such an important part in
                            forming public opinion.</p>
                        <p>If the termination of American financial control is to be pursued on
                            present lines, I believe that our Government could not do better than to
                            encourage the Haitian legislature to take a breathing spell, at least
                            until the return of Minister Armour and Mr. de la Rue, to give time for
                            those who still hold the opinion reflected in the article of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Matin</hi> quoted above, to see that no “coup de
                            théâtre” is in prospect. If the Minister and the Fiscal Representative
                            could, on their return, <pb n="371" xml:id="pg_371" facs="0437"/>give
                            assurances along the lines of those already laid down by President
                            Roosevelt, and if a special session of the legislature were then to be
                            called, the bank contract, would, I believe, stand its best chance of
                            passage.</p>

                            the recent departure for the United States of Haitian Government
                            officials now in New York and goes on to say in effect that the
                            adjournment of the bank question by the Senate is leading to new and
                            favorable consideration on the part of the American Government
                            concerning financial control “which may even bring about the withdrawal

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With a view to improving the opportunities
                            for trade between the United States and Honduras, consideration is being
                            given to the possibility of concluding a mutually advantageous trade
                            agreement between the two countries. Some seventy-five per cent of
                            Honduran exports to the United States consist of bananas. In the
                            proposed agreement, therefore, the United States might undertake that
                            this product should continue to be admitted free of duty in return for
                            reductions in duties by Honduras on important products of the United
                            States. It is possible that in the course of exploratory conversations
                            Honduras might wish to bring to the attention of the United States other
                            products, in addition to bananas, on which concessions would be desired.
                            Sympathetic consideration would be given to any such proposals, although
                            it is believed that in view of the importance of bananas in Honduran
                            trade with the United States a guarantee of continued free entry of this
                            product would be equivalent in value to concessions by Honduras on the
                            principal products imported from the United States.</p>
                        <p>The trade agreement might also contain a provision for unconditional and
                            unrestricted most-favored-nation treatment, subject to the usual
                            exception regarding Cuba, and other generally recognized exceptions;
                            provision against quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports of
                            products respecting which tariff concessions are granted by each party
                            under the agreement; provision against increased internal taxes on such
                            products; and national treatment with respect to internal taxes on all
                            products.</p>
                        <p>Please communicate the above to the Government of Honduras and inform it
                            that if it is prepared to begin exploratory conversations along the
                            lines above indicated the Department will send you very shortly a
                            statement regarding the concessions which would probably be requested by
                            the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0439"/>
                        <p>You should make it clear that the intention of this Government is solely
                            to explore the situation with a view to determining whether
                            negotiations, if undertaken, would be likely to meet with success.</p>
                        <p>It is desired that no publicity be given this matter for the time
                            being.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In accordance with the Department’s
                            instruction No. 592, of July 20, 1934, the Legation has inquired, in a
                            note to the Foreign Office, whether the Honduran Government is prepared
                            to begin exploratory conversations as to the possibility of concluding a
                            mutually advantageous trade agreement between the two countries along
                            the lines indicated in the Department’s instructions.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Minister, Doctor Bermúdez, is in the United States and will
                            be away for possibly two months, but I have had a talk about this matter
                            with Señor Julio Lozano, the Honduran Finance Minister, who is more
                            familiar with tariff and international trade matters than anyone in the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>Señor Lozano, while doubtful that a trade agreement between the two
                            countries could be negotiated that would accomplish much toward
                            increasing the market for United States products in this country, or
                            that there are any other products in addition to bananas that would find
                            a substantial market in the United States if granted concessions, is
                            open to conviction, as he expressed it, and would recommend to his
                            Government that it accept our suggestion that exploratory conversations
                            be commenced, with a view to determining whether negotiations, if
                            undertaken, would be likely to meet with success.</p>
                        <p>During our conversation Doctor Lozano pointed out that until Japan
                            displaced us in the cotton goods market in Honduras, we enjoyed between
                            70% and 80% of the total Honduran import trade, and since we left the
                            gold standard, we have supplied goods to this market that were formerly
                            imported from Great Britain and Germany. He gave me to understand that
                            Honduras would be unwilling to make any bilateral agreement that might
                            cause restrictions of her valuable banana markets in such countries as
                            Germany, which has a treaty with Honduras with provision for
                            most-favored-nation treatment.<note n="1" xml:id="d396fn1">Treaty signed

                        <p>I have not mentioned the subject to Señor Lozano or anyone else but from
                            a cursory study of the different ramifications of the international
                            trade, tariff and treaty situation here, I believe that we could recover
                            our substantial American market in cotton goods in Honduras, which has
                            been captured almost entirely by Japanese low-priced goods, by inducing
                            Honduras to enact a bargaining maximum-minimum tariff law similar to the
                            one recently passed by El Salvador,<note n="2" xml:id="d396fn2">Decree
                                No. 67, June 23, 1934, El Salvador, <hi rend="italic">Diario
                                    Oficial</hi>, July 3, 1934, p. 1451.</note> more easily and more
                            effectively than by the negotiation of a trade agreement. Japan is also
                            underselling American exporters to a small extent in electrical goods in
                            this market but the serious menace to our trade here is in cotton goods.
                            From January to July, 1934, out of a total importation of cotton goods
                            of 1913 bales, Japan supplied 1180, the United States 499, and England
                            234. As yet figures for values are not available. Formerly the United
                            States supplied over 80% of this trade but now the bulk of the orders
                            are going to Japan. I understand that the new tariff of El Salvador has
                            already started the recovery of our cotton goods market in that country.
                            There seems to be no reason why a similar bargaining tariff here would
                            not accomplish the same results.</p>
                        <p>For the above reasons I beg to inquire whether the Department does not
                            deem it advisable for me to inquire, before discussing the question of a
                            trade agreement, whether the Honduran Government would consider the
                            enactment of a bargaining tariff on the Salvador model. Such a tariff
                            would not only benefit us but also Honduras.</p>
                        <p>Honduras could probably increase her exports to the United States in the
                            following articles which are dutiable: cocoanuts, Panama hats, copra and
                            cocoanut lard, now shipped in small quantities, provided a preferential
                            concession over other countries producing these articles is granted.</p>
                        <p>For a more comprehensive review of the new Salvador tariff act, the
                            despatches from our Legation in that country should be consulted. The
                            enclosed extracts from a letter<note n="3" xml:id="d396fn3">Not
                                printed.</note> written by a traveling representative of Bruner

                            Street, New York, to his firm in New York will give the Department an
                            idea of the seriousness of Japanese competition to our cotton goods
                            trade in this country.</p>

                            Finance states that he desires some idea regarding concessions probably

                            before he can begin exploratory conversations. I do not believe he will
                            agree with belief expressed in instruction No. 592, July 20, first
                            paragraph last sentence if equivalent means substantial preferential
                            reduction in duties on principal products imported from the United
                            States. There are no other products in addition to bananas on which
                            Honduras could obtain concessions. Value of Honduran bananas to Germany
                            six times value of German exports to Honduras; England four times and to
                            United States twice the value.</p>

                            concession such as preferential treatment under a tariff law on the
                            Salvador model, in return for a guarantee of continued free entry on

                        <p>41. Your telegram 65, August 16, 6 p.m. Reductions in duties which the
                            United States might agree to make in an agreement with Honduras would
                            apply equally to all countries except Cuba, with which the United States
                            has a special treaty relationship under which the percentage of
                            preference accorded to Cuban products must be maintained. The United
                            States would perceive no objection, therefore, if concessions by
                            Honduras to the United States should be generalized to other countries.
                            Such general reduction would be consonant <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                                facs="0442"/>with our policy, which is to seek an increase in the
                            total volume of international trade, rather than the diversion of such
                            trade.</p>

                            honor to enclose herewith copy and translation of a note dated August
                            22, 1934, from the Honduran Foreign Office,<note n="7" xml:id="d400fn2"
                                >Not printed.</note> expressing the hope that “at your convenience
                            there will be transmitted for submission to study those concessions
                            which your Government will request and, if in agreement, to begin
                            conversations directed toward the termination proposed in your note
                            referred to above.”</p>
                        <p>When I saw Doctor Lozano, the Finance Minister, yesterday, he expressed
                            doubt that concessions to American products in the form of reduced
                            duties would materially increase their sale here and stated that
                            Honduras had reached for the present the limit of its purchasing power
                            for foreign products. He seems inclined to favor securing from the next
                            Congress authority for the Executive to impose a supertax on products
                            from countries that import only small amounts of or no Honduran bananas.
                            I did not discuss this phase of the question with him but later the
                            Department may deem it advisable to consider accepting concessions in
                            this or some other form in lieu of reductions in duties on specific
                            products or general reductions to all countries.</p>
                        <p>This Legation believes that the market for Honduran products in the
                            United States could be slightly increased by better marketing
                            organization but not by reduced duties.</p>
                        <p>It should be borne in mind that any general concessions by Honduras on
                            the products from all countries will not prevent Japan from displacing
                            us in the valuable cotton goods market in this country, which has been
                            worth to American manufacturers on the average during the past three
                            years about $800,000 a year. I understand that Central America purchased
                            before we were replaced by Japan about 20% of our total of exports in
                            cotton goods, and that Honduras imported as much and higher grades as
                            any one of these republics. A copy of a report on this subject dated
                            August 23, 1934, from the Vice Consul at Tegucigalpa, is enclosed
                                herewith.<note n="7" xml:id="d400fn3">Not printed.</note> Any small

                            offset the loss now sustained by the competition from Japan.</p>
                        <p>I shall be in Washington on leave about the middle of next month and will
                            be available to discuss this subject with a member of the “Committee on
                            Foreign Trade Agreements” if so desired.</p>

                            107 of March 7, 1934, from the Consulate in this city,<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d401fn8">Not printed.</note> enclosing a copy and
                            translation of Decree No. 84 of the Honduran Congress, passed on
                            February 17, 1934, and published on March 3, 1934, in which special
                            municipal taxes were imposed upon certain articles of importation to
                            Honduras.</p>
                        <p>Although the provisions of the Decree applied to all countries, it was
                            considered to be primarily aimed at Nicaragua and El Salvador, whose
                            imports, particularly in cattle, cheese, lard, butter and rice, admitted
                            without duty under the free trade treaties between Honduras and those
                            countries were constituting a serious menace to the Honduran producers
                            of these commodities. As was pointed out in the Consulate’s despatch,
                            while the amounts were termed “municipal taxes” they were in reality
                            import duties and were merely given another name for the purpose of
                            evading the obligations of the free trade treaties. This was the view
                            taken of the Decree by Nicaragua and Salvador, since both of these
                            Governments immediately made strong protests to the Government of
                            Honduras against the imposition of these taxes upon imports from their
                            respective countries. As a result of these representations the Council
                            of Ministers finally suspended the provisions of the Decree with respect
                            to importations from Nicaragua and Salvador, although they remained in
                            effect concerning other countries. In view of the provision in the last
                            paragraph in Article VII of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and
                            Consular Rights with Honduras,<note n="9" xml:id="d401fn9">Signed

                                        >iii</hi>, p. 101</ref>.</note> it is felt that the action
                            of the Council of Ministers, however detrimental its effect may be upon
                            American trade, cannot be regarded as a contravention of this
                            treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Vice Consul at La Ceiba has reported to the Legation that local
                            merchants in that city have been informed that they are required to <pb
                                n="378" xml:id="pg_378" facs="0444"/>pay the taxes prescribed in
                            Decree No. 84 on all importations of shoes (listed under “leather goods”
                            and “sole leather”) as of March 8, 1934, the date upon which the Decree
                            entered into effect. The Vice Consul also pointed out that since
                            importations in shoes have already been paid for to the American
                            exporting houses and the shoes sold, the local merchants stand to lose a
                            considerable amount by being obliged to pay this tax retroactively and
                            in consequence future importations of shoes from the United States will
                            be adversely affected. In the despatch from the Consulate in this city
                            referred to above it was also indicated that American trade might
                            likewise be affected so far as lard and butter were concerned.</p>
                        <p>In an interview which I had yesterday with the President of the Chamber
                            of Commerce of San Pedro Sula he pointed out that the above facts had
                            the practical, if not legal, effect of imposing upon certain American
                            imports to Honduras, so far as the North Coast was concerned, additional
                            duties which were not shared by other countries.</p>
                        <p>It is felt therefore that in view of the Department’s instruction No. 592
                            of July 20, 1934, with respect to the possibility of concluding a
                            mutually advantageous trade agreement with Honduras, the present
                            application of Decree No. 84 would appear to possess particular
                            significance and is in consequence brought to the attention of the
                            Department for its consideration.</p>

                            telegram No. 41 of August 18, 1934, explained the Department’s position
                            in regard to the points raised in your inquiry. The United States is not

                            reciprocal trade agreements, but its policy is directed toward a general
                            lowering of the barriers to international trade. The preferential tariff
                            treatment previously accorded certain American exports by Brazil was
                            discontinued about the beginning of 1923 as a result of the decision of
                            the United States Government no longer to ask for such preferential
                            tariff treatment, except in the case of Cuba, with which the United
                            States has a special treaty relationship. Such reductions in tariffs as
                            may result from the reciprocal trade agreements now being considered
                            might therefore, without objection by the United States, be generalized
                            to apply to other countries. In seeking tariff concessions <pb n="379"
                                xml:id="pg_379" facs="0445"/>from Honduras, or any other nation, the
                            United States would, of course, be primarily interested in commodities
                            of which the United States is an important source of supply.</p>

                            conversations at an early date. Since this Government is planning to

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my telegram No. 70, of August
                            31, 4:30 [<hi rend="italic">5?</hi>] P.M., regarding the forthcoming
                            exploratory discussions here regarding the proposed trade agreement
                            between the United States and Honduras, I have the honor to make the
                            following observations for the consideration of the Department.</p>
                        <pb n="380" xml:id="pg_380" facs="0446"/>
                        <p>The Honduran Minister of Finance, who will conduct these conversations on
                            behalf of this Government, will probably be unwilling to grant us tariff
                            reductions on many of the principal United States products exported to
                            Honduras, since such a wide range of reductions would substantially
                            reduce the revenue from customs upon which the maintenance of the
                            Government of the country is largely dependent and which cannot be
                            replaced with other taxes. Any slight advantage that might be gained by
                            an increase in exports of a few Honduran products to the United States
                            created by lower United States duties would not compensate Honduras
                            indirectly for this loss in customs revenue. There may be a few
                            products, however, imported mostly from the United States, now subject
                            to prohibitive duties, the importation of which in larger quantities
                            would increase the revenue without affecting the sale of similar local
                            manufactures, that might form bases for conversations. The American
                            Consulate at Tegucigalpa is making an effort to ascertain what products
                            would meet these conditions and report them to the Department.</p>
                        <p>Another concession that we might request is the abrogation of a law which
                            at present levies municipal taxes on certain products but amounts in
                            effect to an additional import duty on important American products, as
                            explained in the Legation’s despatch No. 1189 of August 27, 1934.</p>
                        <p>We could furthermore request that assurances be given that during the
                            term of the agreement neither these municipal taxes nor any other
                            internal taxes would be levied on products imported from the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the above Honduras might not object to giving us
                            assurances that it would continue to impose no restrictions on
                            importations of our products through exchange control.</p>

                            “municipal” taxes to importations from those countries while permitting
                            them to remain in effect for importations from elsewhere would not
                            appear to contravene the 1927 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and
                            Consular Rights between the United States and Honduras. Under Article
                            VII of that Treaty, although American imports into Honduras are
                            generally accorded most-favored-nation treatment, an exception is made
                            in favor of imports into Honduras from other countries of Central
                            America and from Panama. Accordingly, unless exemption from payment of
                            these “municipal” taxes is accorded importations from a country other
                            than the Republics of Central America and Panama, there would not appear

                            or not grounds exist for a claim of exemption from these taxes, you are
                            directed to ascertain and report whether there are any treaties in force
                            between Honduras and foreign countries other than the Central American
                            States and Panama which contain an unconditional most-favored-nation
                            clause or which are sufficiently broad in their terms to assure to the
                            merchandise from those countries the same treatment accorded merchandise
                            from Nicaragua and El Salvador. If any such treaties are found to exist,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            No. 1139 of July 5, 1934, reporting the desire of the Government of
                            Honduras that the present embargo on the export of arms and munitions of
                            war from the United States to Honduras remain in effect as concerns
                            rifles and ammunition therefor.</p>
                        <p>In the light of the information contained in your despatch, this
                            Government will continue the embargo as at present, except that licenses
                            for the exportation of arms and munitions will be issued in the future
                            only after the Department has been informed by the Honduran Legation in
                            Washington that the prospective shipment has the approval of the
                            Honduran Government. This practice will be followed regardless of
                            whether the consignee in Honduras is the Government, an agency of the
                            Government, a firm, or an individual; and it will apply to arms and
                            munitions of all classes, including arms and their ammunition ordinarily
                            used for sporting purposes.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in the case of each shipment of arms and munitions, the Department
                            will require, not only that an application for an export <pb n="384"
                                xml:id="pg_384" facs="0450"/>license be made by the shipper as
                            heretofore, but also that the Honduran Legation in Washington advise the
                            Department that the shipment has the approval of the Honduran
                            Government, it being understood that in no case will the Department of
                            State take the initiative in seeking such an expression of approval from
                            the Honduran Legation. The question of bringing about such notification
                            to the Department through the Honduran Legation is a matter with regard
                            to which the initiative and responsibility will lie with the Honduran
                            Government and the potential shipper or consignee.</p>
                        <p>With reference to dynamite, blasting powder, and like materials, intended
                            for industrial use, the Department will continue to issue licenses in
                            its own discretion.</p>
                        <p>You will please inform the Honduran Government of the foregoing and
                            notify the Department as soon as acknowledgment of your communication is
                            made.</p>

                            the time of such conversations. Please furnish information. He hopes

                            able to proceed with the discussions with the representatives of Mexico.
                            If agreeable to the Mexican authorities it is desired that the

                            of August 10, 1934,<note n="4" xml:id="d419fn4">Not printed.</note> in
                            which I reported a conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            regarding the pressure that is being brought to bear on the President
                            and on the Foreign Office for the conclusion of a reciprocal tariff
                            agreement on winter vegetables, I have the honor to report that the
                            recent signing of the reciprocal tariff agreement between the United
                            States and Cuba<note n="5" xml:id="d419fn5">For text of agreement, see
                                    <ref target="#pg_169">p. 169</ref>.</note> has, according to
                            Doctor Puig, precipitated further pressure on the Government from the
                            interests in the northwestern part of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Puig told me yesterday that the growers of tomatoes and winter
                            vegetables in that section of Mexico were writing to the Foreign Office
                            urging that the matter of reciprocity between Mexico and the United
                            States be pressed, so that the Mexican growers could receive the same
                            treatment for their products, which would be on the market next winter,
                            as has been accorded to Cuba. I judged, more from the way he talked than
                            from his words, that the growers in the northwestern part of Mexico were
                            pressing his Ministry for action.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Campos-Ortíz, Counselor of the Mexico Embassy, called at the Division
                            this morning and inquired whether I had any information for him
                            regarding the probable date for beginning reciprocal trade negotiations
                            with Mexico. I told him that I was still awaiting word on the
                            subject.</p>
                        <p>He then referred to the concessions granted Cuba by this Government in
                            the matter of certain vegetables and asked whether in the event that
                            negotiations for a trade agreement with Mexico can not be initiated
                            before December or January next, it would be possible to negotiate a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> covering Mexican green vegetables
                            from Sonora and Sinaloa to be in effect pending the completion of an
                            agreement at a later date. His idea seemed to be that this Government
                            might be willing to agree to a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> of
                            this character which would enable Mexican vegetable growers to enter our
                            market on a favorable basis comparable with those of Cuba. He stated
                            that his inquiry was entirely on his own initiative and that he wished
                            to obtain information on the subject merely to enable the Embassy to
                            reply to any inquiries which it may receive from the Mexican Foreign
                            Office. This being the case he stated that he was unable to go into the
                            matter in any further detail. I told him that I would advise him
                            later.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Campos-Ortíz, Counselor of the Mexican Embassy, called on me this
                            morning in regard to his recent inquiry concerning the time of
                            negotiation of a reciprocal trade agreement between the United States
                            and Mexico. I told him that according to the present schedule for
                            negotiations, Mexico will probably be reached towards the end of the
                            coming winter, although it is not absolutely certain that this will be
                            so. I added that since the Department desires to meet the apparent
                            desire of Mexico that negotiations begin as soon as practicable it will
                            be pleased to take up the matter with Mexico sooner, if possible.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Campos-Ortíz then asked whether I had any word for him respecting the
                                <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>. I advised him that upon the
                            receipt from him of a personal or other unofficial communication
                            containing data <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0455"/>of the
                            character above outlined, the matter would be given further attention.
                            Respecting the suggestion that we would be more likely to be interested
                            in the proposal were Mexico to offer concessions on certain of our
                            important agricultural products, Dr. Campos-Ortíz asked whether I could
                            mention some such products. In reply I suggested, as examples, that an
                            offer of concession on lard, ham and canned milk would perhaps be
                            appropriate. I then told him that even in the negotiation of a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> it would be necessary to have
                            hearings as provided in the Tariff Bargaining Act,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d421fn6">Act approved June 12, 1934; 48 Stat. 943.</note>
                            and that consequently it would not be probable that a <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> could be signed before about December 15, should
                            it be decided to follow that course. Finally I told him that in view of
                            the pressure of work resulting from other projected negotiations no
                            assurance could be given that we would be in a position to proceed with
                            the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> even though it were considered
                            desirable as a matter of policy.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Campos-Ortíz pointed out that a new administration will take office
                            in Mexico on December 1, 1934, and that it would be extremely desirable
                            that the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, if negotiated, be signed
                            before the new administration assumes office. He then stated that the
                            Embassy would report to the Mexican Foreign Office and that pending a
                            reply, he would be unable to say what would be done in the matter.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador stated that he wished to eliminate any possibility of a
                            misunderstanding as the result of certain recent informal conversations
                            between Dr. Campos-Ortiz and Mr. Tanis concerning the initiation of
                            negotiations looking to a trade agreement between the United States and
                            Mexico.</p>
                        <p>He referred to advices which he had received from his Government to the
                            effect that the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs had addressed to
                            Ambassador Daniels a communication containing proposals for a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> to establish reciprocal most
                            favored nation treatment for the products of both countries pending the
                            conclusion of a formal trade convention. He said he understood that
                            these proposals had been made to Ambassador Daniels on September 6 and
                            that he wished the Department to know he realized that they must
                            necessarily <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0456"/>take precedence
                            over any informal suggestions that might have been made by anyone
                            attached to his Embassy. There could not, in his opinion, be two
                            separate sets of conversations on the subject, one conducted by his
                            Embassy with the Department, and the other carried on by his Foreign
                            Office through the American Embassy in Mexico City. He desired therefore
                            to have it on record that for the present he would confine his
                            interposition to requesting that he be advised as soon as his
                            Government’s proposals had been received by the Department from the
                            Embassy in Mexico City and, if possible and convenient, that he be kept
                            informed of any developments resulting from the Department’s
                            consideration of them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Reed replied that as soon as the Mexican Government’s communication
                            was received he would be glad so to advise the Ambassador and that the
                            latter could rest assured that the proposals it might contain would
                            receive the Department’s most careful and attentive consideration.</p>

                                facs="0457"/>understanding that the Government of the United States
                            has most favored nation agreements with many more countries than these
                            four. Due to the imports which Mexico receives from these four
                            countries, it would appear that under the proposed <hi rend="italic"
                                >modus vivendi</hi> the United States would not gain anything but
                            recognition of the most favored nation clause and a promise of a
                            permanent treaty, while on the other hand Mexico would not only gain the
                            reduced tariff granted to Cuba on imports into the United States of
                            winter vegetables, but also might very possibly receive other tangible
                            advantages not only through the recent agreement made with Cuba by the
                            United States but also due to our most favored nation agreements now in
                            force between the United States and other countries, this, too, without
                            giving to the United States a substantial <hi rend="italic">quid pro
                                quo</hi>. Doctor Puig mentions that he has followed the wording of
                            the <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> entered into with Italy. The
                            situation which existed between Italy and Mexico does not seem to be
                            analogous to that which exists between the United States and Mexico.</p>
                        <p>As has been reported in the past, Doctor Puig has stated to me that he
                            has been under considerable pressure from the growers on the West Coast
                            of Mexico to obtain some reduction on the United States tariff on their
                            products. As the Department knows, he has been endeavoring to have the
                            Department begin negotiations for a reciprocal tariff agreement. Now
                            that there does not appear to be any chance of this being done until the
                            end of the winter, he has proposed a <hi rend="italic">modus
                                vivendi</hi> which can be entered into by an exchange of notes which
                            will redound to Mexico’s advantage in the question of winter vegetables
                            and which would, therefore, satisfy the demands of the growers on the
                            West Coast.</p>
                        <p>As of possible interest to the Department, the following is the
                            approximate value of the importations into the United States from Mexico
                            of tomatoes and of the total of all winter vegetables for the last three

                        <p>Yesterday afternoon, September 10th, when I called at the Foreign Office
                            and discussed this matter with Doctor Puig, he said that the growers of
                            Yucatan have been making appeals to the Minister of Hacienda to secure
                            the same treatment for sisal grown in that part of this country as their
                            competitors in Cuba receive under the new reciprocity treaty with Cuba.
                            They were quite as insistent as the people of Northwestern Mexico are as
                            to prompt action to give <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0458"
                            />markets for tomatoes and early vegetables, and as the cattle raisers
                            in Northern Mexico for a reduction of the tariff on cattle weighing less
                            than 700 pounds.</p>
                        <p>In a despatch, dated September 4, 1934, to the State Department,<note
                                n="12" xml:id="d423fn12">Not printed.</note> the American Consul at
                            Guaymas quoted Governor Calles of Sonora as saying that he believed
                            there ought to be no difficulty in finding commodities for reciprocal
                            agreements, mentioning specifically that the State of Sonora was
                            concerned particularly with winter vegetables and cattle. The Governor
                            says that tomatoes are produced for export from the Yaqui Valley in
                            January and even as early as December, and adds: “They would not be in
                            serious competition with growers of that vegetable in the United
                            States”. He says that the same is true of green peas. He argued that it
                            would be mutually advantageous if the United States would abolish the
                            duty on cattle under 700 pounds, or at least make some concessions. If
                            Secretary Sayre has not had this letter from the Consul at Guaymas
                            brought to his attention, I commend it to his consideration.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation yesterday with Dr. Puig I asked him what Mexico would
                            be ready to offer to the United States in return for the request for
                            reciprocal duties on tomatoes, sisal, etc. He said they would grant
                            reductions on iron pipe, eighty-five per cent of which comes to Mexico
                            from the United States, and on lard and its products. I asked: “How
                            about automobiles?” He thought something might be done for automobiles
                            in the agreement, and would speak to the Minister of Hacienda about
                            that. I called to his attention a conversation I had, upon the occasion
                            of my trip to Ciuclad Juarez and El Paso, with the Mexican Collector of
                            Customs at Ciudad Juarez. The Collector said that Mexico could well
                            afford to abolish the tariff on automobiles, so that many more Mexicans
                            could buy them from the United States, adding: “The Mexican Government
                            would derive more revenue from the larger purchases of gasoline by the
                            increased owners of cars than is now derived from the automobile tax”.
                            In order to secure the proposed <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> at
                            an early date, Doctor Puig said the Mexican Government would naturally
                            be willing to meet the United States upon equal terms in the tariff
                            reductions. It was clear that Doctor Puig, due to pressure from the
                            growers of the West Coast of Mexico, and also perhaps due to pressure
                            from other sources, is doing his utmost to have negotiations opened at
                            the earliest possible moment, to the end that winter vegetables grown in
                            Mexico can secure markets in the United States in December of this year
                            and January of 1935. If the negotiations are delayed, the growers of
                            Mexico will feel that their competitors in Cuba have an advantage which
                            is denied them. An early agreement would greatly gratify the Mexican
                            Government <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0459"/>and the growers.
                            They feel that if there is to be a reciprocity treaty between this
                            country and Mexico it should take effect by December. Undoubtedly they
                            would be willing to make more concessions now than if negotiations are
                            postponed and the barter deferred until after the winter vegetable
                            season has passed.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Ambassador</hi>: Through our Embassy in
                                Washington we have learned that the Department of State of the
                                United States has advised that in accordance with the program in
                                relation to trade agreements which the American Administration has
                                outlined for itself, the negotiations for a trade agreement with
                                Mexico could begin about the end of the coming winter.</p>
                            <p>In view of the above and in order to secure a procedure that will
                                permit the exportation of our fresh vegetables during the coming
                                winter, under conditions similar to those adopted for Cuba, our
                                Embassy approached the Department of State with respect to the
                                possibility of concluding a provisional <hi rend="italic">modus
                                    vivendi</hi> to cover the exports of such products and which
                                would remain in force until the conclusion of the principal
                                convention.</p>
                            <p>Our Ambassador advises us that information that he has obtained from
                                the Department in question appears to him to indicate that the
                                Government of the United States would be disposed to consider the
                                possibility of a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, and that the
                                question would resolve itself as soon as we submitted, even though
                                informally, the respective proposal (<hi rend="italic">consulta
                                    respectiva</hi>), since the suggestion made by Ambassador
                                González Roa did not appear as yet to be based upon specific
                                instructions from this Ministry.</p>
                            <p>Wishing to hasten the conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">modus
                                    vivendi</hi> referred to above, I have the honor to present to
                                Your Excellency the formal request of Mexico for the establishment
                                of that <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> by means of an exchange
                                of notes between that Embassy and this Ministry, and I am taking the
                                liberty of suggesting, for the consideration of the Department of
                                State, the following wording, similar in sense to that of the notes
                                exchanged with the Government of Italy for the establishment of a
                                similar <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi>, with the sole
                                exclusion from the document now proposed of the paragraph which in
                                the case of <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0460"/>Italy excepts
                                from most-favored-nation treatment the system of customs duties and

                        <p>144. Your despatch No. 1771, September 11. Import duty on Cuban tomatoes
                            is established by agreement with that country at one and eight-tenths
                            cents per pound during months of December, January and February and it
                            is further provided in the agreement that the tariff rate accorded Cuba
                            shall be at least twenty per cent, lower than that applying to tomatoes
                            from any other country. Consequently the minimum rate that could be
                            accorded Mexican tomatoes would under existing conditions be two and
                            one-quarter cents per pound for the same months unless a further
                            reduction is granted Cuba which probably is impossible at this time.</p>
                        <p>Reductions are granted Cuba on lima beans, cucumbers, okra, and eggplant
                            but it is not believed Mexico is particularly interested in these. No
                            reduction has been granted Cuba on peas.</p>
                        <p>Please bring foregoing to the attention of Foreign Office and state that
                            before giving further consideration to the matter of entering into
                            negotiation of a limited tariff agreement with Mexico as proposed by the
                            Foreign Minister the Department desires to be informed whether the
                            Mexican Government understands the situation with respect to Cuba and is
                            sufficiently interested in the above mentioned maximum possible
                            reduction on tomatoes to proceed with discussions.</p>
                        <p>It should be made clear to the Mexican authorities that provisions of
                            agreement with Cuba prevent extending to any other country rates of duty
                            as low as those applicable to Cuban products and that no agreement with
                            Mexico could be made by this Government except in full compliance with
                            the procedural and substantive provisions of the Trade Agreements Act of
                            1934.</p>

                                printed.</note> with regard to the possibility of making a

                            definitive trade agreement, so as to make possible the shipment by
                            Mexico of vegetables this coming winter.</p>
                        <p>Before receiving your letter, I had been studying the two despatches
                            which you mention,<note n="16" xml:id="d426fn16">Despatches No. 1771,

                            Section is giving serious consideration to the suggestion contained in
                            the despatches. I have been somewhat concerned, however, lest there be a
                            misunderstanding on the part of the Mexican Government. The terms of our
                            Cuban Trade Agreement are such that we could not give to a third country
                            the same rates that we have given to Cuba on certain Cuban products,
                            Cuba being especially exempt from our most-favored-nation obligations. I
                            sent a telegram to you last week<note n="17" xml:id="d426fn17"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> explaining this situation.</p>
                        <p>If Mexico is interested in such a reduction as we can make on tomatoes
                            and fresh vegetables, however, and will grant us concessions in return
                            which are substantial ones to make possible our exportation into Mexico
                            of increased agricultural products, such as lard, I feel that we should
                            give the Mexican proposal the most serious consideration; and, in the
                            event that such an agreement seems desirable, I think it might be
                            possible to push the arrangement through before the making of a more
                            definitive trade agreement in time to take care of the vegetable trade
                            during the coming winter.</p>
                        <p>I hope all goes well with you and Mrs. Daniels. It is always a delight to
                            hear from you.</p>

                            favored nation treatment in regard to the vessels and the raw and
                            manufactured products of the other. There is transmitted herewith a copy
                            of my letter of October 1, 1934<note n="19" xml:id="d427fn19">Not
                                printed.</note> to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Doctor José
                            Manuel Puig Casauranc, in which I summarize the information contained in
                            the Department’s telegram above referred to.</p>
                        <p>Upon receiving my letter Doctor Puig stated that the possibility of
                            Mexico receiving a tariff of 2¼¢ per pound on tomatoes imported into the
                            United States from Mexico in place of the present duty of 30 per pound
                            seemed well worth discussing. He also referred to that portion of my
                            letter which stated that the Government of the United States could make
                            no agreement with Mexico except in full compliance with the procedural
                            and substantive provisions of the trade agreement acts of 1934, and said
                            that this would appear to indicate that the negotiation of a <hi
                                rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> covering this matter would have to
                            be carried on under practically the same conditions as the negotiation
                            of a reciprocal trade agreement between the two countries.</p>
                        <p>As reported in my telegram above referred to, Doctor Puig stated that he
                            was sending by air mail this morning a translation of my letter of
                            October 1, 1934 to Minister of Hacienda Marte R. Gómez, now in New York,
                            and to Ambassador González Roa, with the suggestion that they take up
                            the matter directly with the Department.</p>

                            enclosing a copy of the letter from Mr. Thomas H. Lockett, Commercial
                            Attaché, to yourself dated October 30, 1934,<note n="19"
                                xml:id="d428fn2">Not printed.</note> concerning the negotiation of a
                            limited trade agreement with the Mexican Government, When I wrote you on
                            October 2 I felt that there still might be time to meet the Mexican
                            desire to negotiate a limited trade agreement covering the importation
                            of tomatoes and fresh vegetables from Mexico during the coming winter.
                            Since I wrote that letter, six weeks have passed, and we have not as yet
                            had any direct word from the representatives of Mexico concerning the
                            negotiation of such an <pb n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0464"
                            />agreement. In view of the necessity under the law of holding public
                            hearings and giving sufficient notice in advance of these, it would seem
                            that the possibility of negotiating such a limited trade agreement to
                            cover the shipment of tomatoes and fresh vegetables during the coming
                            winter has now passed and that we must turn our attention instead to the
                            possibility of a more comprehensive trade agreement between the two
                            Governments. Inasmuch as our hands are already more than full with the
                            negotiation of such agreements as have already been publicly announced,
                            I think we will have to wait now and let Mexico take a normal place on
                            the schedule of our trade agreements program.</p>

                            Ambassador González Roa and experts in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.
                            He added that he would also give the whole matter serious consideration

                            28th I presented the plan to Ambassador González Roa and pointed out
                            that the Mexican proposals were unacceptable, both as to the amount and
                            terms of payment. I gave him a copy of the proposed protocol as to
                            General Claims and told him that if it was acceptable to Mexico and put
                            in operation, the Government of the United States would then be willing,
                            after evaluation, to consider a reasonable en bloc settlement. The
                            Mexican officials clearly understand that the Department wishes a full
                            exploration of General Claims before taking up the suggestion of an en
                            bloc settlement either of General or Special Claims.</p>
                        <p>While Mexican officials are making up their minds as to what answer they
                            will make to the Department’s proposal, I feel it my duty to state
                            plainly the conclusions I have reached after eight months <pb n="399"
                                xml:id="pg_399" facs="0465"/>of study and consideration of the whole
                            matter. In coming to the recommendation I am hereby proposing, I have
                            had no thought except to try to ascertain, not what technically or
                            legally we have a right to insist upon, but to strip the whole
                            controversy of everything else and get down to the basic principle of
                            what in equity and justice we ought to insist upon. In other words, I
                            have tried to go beneath pleadings and agreements, forced or voluntary,
                            and ask what we would expect Mexico to demand of our country if
                            conditions were reversed.</p>
                        <p>As to the Special Claims, arising between 1910 and 1920, I agree with the
                            conclusions of the Commissions between Mexico and several European
                            Governments, that Mexico should not be required to pay for acts by
                            revolutionists and bandits unless there is shown negligence on the part
                            of responsible governmental authorities. We must take into consideration
                            that for many years there was no stable government in Mexico. To be
                            sure, I recognize that Carranza pledged payments for such acts and that
                            later Obregón made like promises, and promises to pay for losses and
                            damages were incorporated in the Warren-Payne treaty<note n="24"

                            recognition. However, I also am aware that a large number of these
                            claims are made by Americans residing here who preferred to run all
                            risks rather than accept the advice of President Wilson, who offered
                            them safe transportation into the United States in the hectic days of
                            revolution. Instead of accepting his urgent pleas, they elected to
                            remain. Some of them hoped and worked for American intervention and, in
                            lieu of that, demanded that American warships remain in Mexican waters
                            and that American troops be dispatched into the interior of Mexico to
                            protect their property. Inasmuch as I was a part of the administration
                            in that period, those conditions and the serious situation is fresh in
                            my mind. Though Mexico promised to pay damages, many of the claims have
                            no merit. Very few Special Claims have been adjudicated.</p>
                        <p>In view of the situation thus sketched, I have come to the conclusion
                            that we are justified by the plainest equity to make these proposals to
                            the Mexican Government:</p>
                        <p>(1) With reference to Special Claims, present at the earliest opportunity
                            to the Mexican Government a counter proposal, which the Department has
                            in mind, providing for an en bloc settlement on a basis of 2.65%. This
                            is the average recovery in the settlement of claims of Belgium, France,
                            Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain against Mexico for losses or
                            damages during the revolutionary period of 1910–1920. The claims of
                            those countries are similar to our Special Claims.</p>
                        <p>This suggestion makes no distinction between memorialized and
                            unmemorialized cases. Ambassador González Roa based his argument <pb
                                n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0466"/>for such distinction (proposing
                            1.25% for unmemorialized claims) upon the statement that under the terms
                            of the 1839 and 1868 Claims Conventions<note n="25" xml:id="d429fn25"

                            the average recovery was 1.25% for American claims. The weakness in his
                            contention is that, in the agreements with the European Governments, no
                            distinction was made between the memorialized and the unmemorialized
                            claims. If we accept the figure agreed upon in the Conventions by those
                            six countries, it seems that the contention that distinction be made
                            between memorialized and unmemorialized claims, which Ambassador
                            González Roa urged, lacks foundation.</p>
                        <p>If Mexico paid 2.65% on all Special Claims, the sum it would pay would be
                            about seven and three quarter million dollars. In my judgment effort
                            should be made to adjust the Special Claims before pressing the
                            suggested protocol on General Claims, particularly in view of the
                            settlements made by Mexico with European countries having similar
                            claims. Such precedents might serve as a guide to any domestic
                            commission appointed to adjudicate the claims and to pro-rate the amount
                            received from Mexico.</p>
                        <p>(2) With reference to General Claims, my suggestion is that our
                            Government offer to settle on a basis of 8%. The figure of 8% is the
                            average recovery under the decisions rendered so far by the General
                            Claims Commission, exclusive of the claims of the Illinois Central
                            Railway, which the Mexican Government contends, and with reason, should
                            be eliminated from consideration in fixing the average recovery
                            percentage because liability was admitted by the Government which was
                            ready to settle out of court. Acceptance of 8% for General Claims would
                            amount to about eleven million dollars, exclusive of awards heretofore
                            rendered by the General Claims Commission of about two and a half
                            million dollars, and of interest on awards of about $836,000.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, if the protocol suggested by the Department is not
                            agreed to by the Mexican Government, in order to reconstitute the
                            General Claims Commission, it would be necessary only to exchange
                            ratifications of the Convention signed June 18, 1932,<note n="26"
                                xml:id="d429fn26"><ref target="frus1932v05#pg_740"><hi rend="italic"

                                        >v</hi>, p. 740</ref>.</note> and to secure an agreement
                            from the Mexican Government regarding the appointment of a Neutral
                            Presiding Commissioner. This sounds easy, but past experience in
                            selecting a Presiding Commissioner, or one who will give his whole time
                            to the duty, does not justify expectation of easy and prompt action in
                            this regard. The Department’s proposal embodied in the suggested
                            protocol is an improvement upon the protocol<note n="27"
                                xml:id="d429fn27"><ref target="frus1932v05#pg_742"><hi rend="italic"
                                        >Ibid.</hi>, p. 742</ref>.</note> which is part of the
                            Convention of June 18, 1932. However, even with that better plan looking
                            to expedition, it is by no means certain that the pleadings and
                            conclusions could be completed within two years. It is more probable
                            that the delays experienced by <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0467"
                            />the old Commission would be repeated, with the continued expense and
                            no assurance that claimants would get anything in their lifetime.</p>
                        <p>As I understand it, while the General Claims Commission can carry on by
                            an exchange of ratifications, the Department has held that as regards
                            the Special Commission, the Senate must ratify the protocol, signed by
                            Ambassador Clark and Minister Téllez<note n="28" xml:id="d429fn28"><ref

                                    746</ref>.</note> before there can be a reconstitution. While
                            the ratification of the new treaty of the Special Claims Convention was
                            pending, Senator King, in a public statement, objected to its
                            ratification in view of the fact that the change made to the existing
                            Convention would lessen the rights of claimants in the United States,
                            saying that “the present treaty does not exclude from this jurisdiction
                            of the Convention the claims originating from the acts of the Huerta
                            forces or claims originating through the circulation or acceptance,
                            voluntary or forced, of paper money”. He objected to giving
                            consideration to the policy pursued by Germany, Spain, France, Italy,
                            England and Belgium in reaching an agreement with Mexico for claims
                            originating between 1910–1920, the period for which the Special Claims
                            Commission was set up.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as the new treaty to reconstitute the Special Claims Commission
                            had not been acted upon by the Senate, pending negotiations looking to
                            an en bloc settlement, it may be that Senator King would again object to
                            ratification. I judge from the suggestion of the Department, that, after
                            the acceptance of the proposed protocol by Mexico, it would consider an
                            en bloc settlement for Special Claims.</p>
                        <p>I have kept in mind that my predecessor, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Téllez,
                            former Minister for Foreign Affairs, conducted negotiations looking to
                            an en bloc settlement. The amount the United States representative
                            suggested for a settlement of claims under both the General and Special
                            Claims was fifty million dollars. That figure was reached by applying a
                            percentage basis of 11.5 to the net American claims, after deducting the
                            value of the Mexican claims. That percentage is the average recovery in
                            claims adjustments between Governments covering a period of 140 years.
                            That proposal for Mexico to pay the United States the sum of fifty
                            million dollars was not entertained by Minister Téllez because he
                            regarded it as too large a sum.</p>
                        <p>If the Department agrees with these recommendations, I would suggest that
                            the United States, instead of pressing for the protocol proposed to the
                            Mexican Government, if Dr. Puig’s answer should be unfavorable, offer a
                            counter proposal for about twenty-two million dollars as a settlement of
                            both General and Special Claims, based on the use of 8% for General
                            Claims and 2.65% for Special Claims, without making any distinction
                            between memorialized and unmemorialized claims.</p>
                        <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0468"/>
                        <p>I sincerely believe, everything considered, including our inability at
                            this time to collect debts due by European countries directly to the
                            Federal Treasury, and the impossibility of our nationals to collect on
                            moneys loaned by them, either with or without governmental
                            quasi-approval, to governments in South America and Europe, that we
                            should substitute an equitable for a strictly legal liability with
                            reference to claims by our nationals against Mexico. The history of
                            claims controversies between the United States and Mexico is a sad, long
                            story of disagreements, mainly growing out of the claims of our
                            nationals, some of whom came into this country seeking concessions and
                            large returns upon their money, rather than to accept the less
                            speculative returns promised at home. Pursuing such course, they have
                            lived in Mexico many years, all the while holding on to their American
                            citizenship in the belief that our country would enforce their claims
                            against the country of their residence.</p>
                        <p>It is of the highest importance if possible to reach an agreement which
                            will put ancient and revolutionary claims behind us, and seek, in
                            accordance with the Claims Conventions of 1923, to secure something for
                            our nationals who have just claims rather than continue hearings which
                            may not be finished in our day.</p>
                        <p>I am not unmindful of the disappointment which would be experienced by
                            our nationals following any settlement of their claims on a less basis
                            than they think is their just due. Equally I recognize, if an en bloc
                            sum is accepted, that there are troubles in store for a domestic
                            commission which would be constituted to apportion whatever amount
                            Mexico would pay. There is no escape from difficulties no matter what
                            policy is adopted.</p>
                        <p>My theory in the present situation is that our Government is in the
                            strongest position when it meets Mexico in a spirit of large liberality
                            and generosity, confident it is demanding nothing more from Mexico than
                            we would expect Mexico to pay us if conditions were reversed.</p>
                        <p>Of course I have no information as to what Mexico’s response would be to
                            the proposal outlined above, or as to what answer it will make with
                            regard to the proposed protocol. No intimation has come to me since
                            Ambassador González Roa’s proposal of a payment of $13,500,000 in thirty
                            annual installments, and our declination of that proposal. In talking
                            with Minister Puig yesterday, he said that he thought it was a mistake
                            to incorporate thirty years for payment in the González Roa proposition.
                            “It was too long a term”, he said, “and Mexico ought to pay at the rate
                            of a million dollars a year”. Beyond that he volunteered nothing.</p>
                        <p>As stated above, whether the proposal set forth here would be accepted or
                            rejected by Mexico, I have no means of knowing. One thing I do feel, and
                            feel strongly, is that in submitting it we would <pb n="403"
                                xml:id="pg_403" facs="0469"/>be proposing what is manifestly fair
                            and just in view of Mexican pledges and all the present day conditions.
                            I do not hesitate to say that, if there had been no 1923 treaty, I would
                            not feel we should hold the Mexican Government of 1934 responsible for
                            the acts that occurred during the periods of revolution, beginning with
                            the murder of Madero and continuing for years. It is “nominated in the
                            bond”, however, that they shall pay to us as they have agreed to pay to
                            European nations. Therefore, our Government is committed to press for
                            such payment as other enlightened nations will receive for like injuries
                            and damages in the same period. Beyond that, my judgment does not
                            dictate our Government should go in seeking payment to claimants.</p>
                        <p>I will promptly report the response to the proposition for the proposed
                            protocol and await your further instructions.</p>

                        <p>15. Your despatch No. 1031, January 26. Lump sum offer proposed by you
                            contemplates allowance to Mexico of more than $15,000,000 on ancient
                            claims to land in Texas and California, in support of which Mexico has
                            filed no evidence and which claims were for several reasons considered
                            by the American Agency, after an elaborate investigation, to be
                            worthless. Such a settlement would also create the obligation upon
                            Congress to appropriate corresponding sum to make good to American
                            citizens the amount of national liability thus theoretically avoided by
                            offset of the claims of American citizens. Court of Claims long since
                            held that such national obligation is created in that manner and
                            Congress has in the past recognized such obligation by appropriation of
                            large sums.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Conformably to the last sentence of the
                            Department’s cable No. 15 of February 3, 1934, an effort is herein made
                            to give you, in general but brief outline, the views of the Department
                            with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods of
                            settling the outstanding claims now under consideration, and the reasons
                            for believing that the question of a lump sum settlement should be held
                            in abeyance until it has been clearly demonstrated that such a protocol
                            as is now under consideration cannot be concluded.</p>
                        <p>The Department is not unmindful that an immediate lump sum settlement in
                            which the Mexican Government would agree to pay this Government the sum
                            of $22,000,000 would have advantages. On analysis, however, the
                            advantages are perhaps somewhat more apparent than real.</p>
                        <p>In order to determine what amount the Mexican Government would pay on the
                            unadjudicated general claims of the United States totalling $384,400,000
                            (after deductions for duplicate filings and adjudications), it is
                            necessary, in the first instance, to deduct from the amount of
                            $22,000,000 the amount which would be paid on special claims, and also
                            the amount already awarded by the General Claims Commission. The special
                            claims, after deductions, amount, in round figures, to $291,300,000. The
                            liability of the Mexican Government on these claims, calculated on the
                            lowest possible basis, namely, that representing the average recovery of
                            all European Governments in the same class of cases, would be about
                            $7,700,000. In this connection it is to be borne in mind, however, that
                            under the special claims conventions heretofore concluded, there is a
                            wider basis of liability than that upon which the European claims have
                            been decided, and that, since the Senate has not agreed to any
                            curtailment of this basis of liability, there might be opposition in the
                            Senate to a lump sum settlement of special claims on the basis of the
                            European average percentage of recovery. The amount of awards by the
                            General Claims Commission, including interest, is about $3,432,000. The
                            sum of these awards and the amount to cover special claims, on the basis
                            of the European average recovery, would total about $11,150,000, leaving
                            from the $22,000,000 to be paid by Mexico to be applied on the
                            unadjudicated general claims the sum of only about $10,850,000. The
                            general claims over which this $10,850,000 would be distributed (in the
                            absence of any contribution by this Government) amount, after
                            deductions, to $380,400,000. Therefore, the amount of indemnity to be
                            paid by the Mexican Government on the unadjudicated general claims would
                            amount to approximately <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0471"/>2.8 per
                            cent, or a slight fraction over the amount which, it appears, the
                            Mexican Government is willing to concede on the special claims. The
                            Department is not aware that it has ever been seriously contended by the
                            Mexican Government that its actual liability on general claims would
                            amount to such a small percentage.</p>
                        <p>In the event that a lump sum settlement involving the payment of
                            $22,000,000 were made, this $22,000,000 would then be distributed
                            approximately as follows: <table rows="4" cols="2"

                        <p>As was indicated in the enclosure with the Department’s instruction No.
                            214 of December 16, last, there are reasons to believe that the awards
                            of a domestic commission before which both the general and special
                            claims would have to go for adjudication, in the event of a lump sum
                            settlement, would be larger than those of an international commission.
                            The probabilities are, therefore, that the awards of the domestic
                            commission would far exceed the amount of the lump sum settlement. The
                            result would be a strong demand that this Government make good the
                            deficit. Claimants would have as a basis for their claim of obligation
                            on the part of this Government to appropriate the difference, decisions
                            of the Court of Claims holding that such lump sum settlements, which
                            involve a set-off of American claims against claims of a foreign
                            government or its nationals, create such an obligation toward the
                            American claimants. (In this connection see the decisions in 21 Court of
                            Claims, 340, 390; 22, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, 408, and 457; and
                            46, <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, 214, 224.) It is not unlikely,
                            therefore, that, with this method of settlement, this Government would
                            ultimately be compelled to appropriate many millions of dollars to
                            settle the claims of American citizens against Mexico.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that a large part of this liability on the part of the
                            United States could be avoided, without injury to the rights of American
                            citizens and without great loss of time in settling the claims, by the
                            procedure outlined in the proposed protocol now under consideration. The
                            reasons for this conclusion are in brief as follows:</p>
                        <p>The unadjudicated general claims of the Mexican Government which, under
                            the $22,000,000 lump sum proposal, would be evaluated at 8 per cent,
                            amount, after deductions, to approximately $245,000,000. For the purpose
                            of the lump sum settlement, these claims would be appraised at 8 per
                            cent or $19,600,000 which amount would, in effect, be paid by this
                            Government to Mexico, since, to arrive at the $22,000,000 lump sum
                            basis, that amount would be deducted from the actual <pb n="406"
                                xml:id="pg_406" facs="0472"/>liability on American claims of
                            approximately $41,400,000. This would not be of great moment if the
                            Mexican claims were of a general diversified type of mixed claims such
                            as our own. But quite the contrary is true. Approximately 95 per cent of
                            the claims of the Mexican Government are based upon alleged illegal
                            deprivations of title to real estate in Texas and California nearly 100
                            years ago. The Mexican Government has up to the present time put in no
                            material evidence to support these claims. The American Agency, it is
                            understood, made a somewhat extensive investigation of the circumstances
                            of the claims, having sent an attorney to Texas to study the claims on
                            the ground, and reached the conclusion that the claims were, for several
                            reasons, entirely unfounded. There might, therefore, be basis for
                            considerable criticism of the Department if it recommended a lump sum
                            settlement which would contemplate giving Mexico credit for any such sum
                            as, say $18,000,000 for these claims, and then ask Congress to make good
                            to American citizens the difference between the amount of the awards of
                            a domestic commission and the amount of recovery from Mexico under the
                            lump sum agreement. On the other hand, it is believed that, if the
                            claims were passed upon by appraisers and an umpire as contemplated in
                            the proposed protocol, several more satisfactory results would follow,
                            namely: <list>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the Mexican land claims would be
                                    found to be invalid, thus reducing from $19,600,000 to perhaps
                                    one million the amount of proper deductions from Mexico’s
                                    liability towards this Government.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, the liability of this
                                    Government toward American claimants would be proportionately
                                    reduced. This might result in the saving of many millions of
                                    dollars to this Government.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, as was indicated to you in the
                                    enclosure with instruction No. 214 of December 16, the
                                    adjudication of international claims by a domestic commission is
                                    attended with many embarrassing and expensive circumstances. In
                                    the first instance, the expense of a domestic commission would
                                    be much greater than the informal proceedings contemplated by
                                    the pending protocol. Then, the proceedings before a domestic
                                    commission are made infinitely more difficult, protracted and
                                    expensive because of the fact that the evidence bearing upon one
                                    side of the case is scattered throughout Mexico and, in order to
                                    provide for proper adjudication of the case, it would probably
                                    be necessary to maintain in Mexico for a period of several years
                                    a Commissioner to take testimony. In the most recent instance of
                                    such a lump sum settlement, namely that relating to claims
                                    against Spain at the termination of the Spanish-American War,
                                    the claims numbered about 500 and amounted to about $2,000,000.
                                    The domestic adjudication proceedings continued over a period of
                                    approximately eight years and the cost thereof, including the
                                    expense of a Commissioner in Cuba to take testimony, amounted to
                                    approximately $1,200,000. There is no reason to expect more
                                    expeditious or less expensive proceedings in the case of a
                                    domestic adjudication of the special and general claims against
                                    Mexico.</item>

                                <item><hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, at the present time, in common
                                    with the rest of the world, Mexico is in a state of economic
                                    depression. The general attitude of many world powers at the
                                    present time with respect to international obligation is not a
                                    wholesome one. In the event of a lump sum settlement with Mexico
                                    there might be considered to be more reason for expecting
                                    leniency toward a failure to meet an international obligation
                                    arbitrarily arrived at than if such obligation were based upon
                                    definite judicial determinations. In connection with a lump sum
                                    settlement there must be considered, of course, not only the
                                    amount of liability but the terms under which it will be paid.
                                    It is the hope of all, of course, that financial conditions
                                    throughout the world will have considerably improved within the
                                    next two or three years. It would seem, therefore, that the end
                                    of that period might be a more propitious one for determining
                                    the manner in which the amount of liability to this Government
                                    could be met without serious embarrassment to the Mexican
                                    Government.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Since it is the belief of the Department that the appraisal of the claims
                            under the proposed protocol could be completed within three years at the
                            most, including the umpire proceedings, and since the fixation of the
                            liability of the Mexican Government and the conditions for the
                            liquidation thereof, at the end of that period, might be more
                            advantageous to American claimants, and much more advantageous to this
                            Government than the arbitrary fixation of that liability and the terms
                            of payment at the present time, there would seem to be no compelling
                            reasons why the lump sum settlement should be concluded at present. Of
                            course, such a lump sum settlement at present would, in effect, remove
                            these international claims from the field of diplomatic discussion. On
                            the other hand, it is believed that the conclusion of the protocol would
                            have virtually the same effect. As you are aware, it is the general
                            thought underlying the protocol that the exchange of pleadings and the
                            appraisal of the claims would be conducted in a quite unostentatious
                            manner, without the establishment of a Commission and without direct
                            contact of any kind between the Foreign Offices of the two
                            Governments.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, aside from the fact that a lump sum settlement would
                            immediately remove claims settlements from the field of international
                            discussion, practically all of the advantages are on the side of the
                            informal proceedings provided for in the draft protocol. It was these
                            and other related reasons which prompted the Department’s cable No. 15
                            of February 3, which was despatched in advance of this instruction.</p>
                        <p>From the foregoing you will appreciate the fact that this whole matter is
                            being considered from the practical, rather than from the purely
                            legalistic, standpoint with a view to avoiding the creation of a basis
                            for large liability on the part of this Government toward American
                            claimants.</p>

                                    General Claims Convention signed June 18, 1932, for the handling
                                    of agrarian claims through diplomatic discussions. This change
                                    appears as Article First. The remaining Articles are re-numbered

                        <p>I saw Dr. Puig this morning and I brought up the point that the period of
                            fifteen years for the payment of Special Claims might be considered too
                            long, calling his attention to the fact that when we had talked about
                            this matter some weeks ago, he had stated that he hoped an en bloc
                            settlement could be reached on both General and Special Claims and that
                            he hoped the Government could pay the total amount at the rate of a
                            million dollars a year. Dr. Puig replied that if we settle only the
                            Special Claims, the Mexican Government could not pay so much a year, in
                            view of other obligations and the fact that in the future they would
                            have to arrange for whatever was awarded in the General Claims. He said
                            that when he had said a million dollars a year it would have been a
                            great strain on the resources of the Treasury. Also he said that if an
                            en bloc settlement is reached for Special Claims on the same basis that
                            Mexico will pay Spain, France, England and other European countries,
                            Mexico would have to meet the obligations due those countries at the
                            same time that it paid the United States on Special Claims.</p>
                        <p>I hope the Department will find it practicable to agree to the proposal
                            of Dr. Puig. It is not likely that our nationals who have filed <pb
                                n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0476"/>Special Claims will ever
                            receive a larger amount than is now proposed. Inasmuch as the average
                            settlement of the European claims is 2.6%, claims that are practically
                            identical with those of Americans, I do not see how we could insist upon
                            a larger percentage of recovery.</p>
                        <p>The en bloc settlement of Special Claims will put an end to international
                            controversies growing out of the revolutionary period 1910–1920, during
                            part of which time many revolutionary factions attempted to carry on the
                            functions of government. The details connected with the final figures to
                            be used in the en bloc settlement of Special Claims and the points to be
                            covered in a convention will be submitted later to the Department, after
                            I have had further exchanges of views with the Foreign Office and in the
                            light of any instructions deemed desirable.</p>

                                General and Special Claims Commissions.</p>
                            <p>On his return from Montevideo, and on inquiring about various matters
                                pending with the Government of the United States, Puig has learned
                                with real regret that the question of an en bloc settlement of
                                claims could not, as he had hoped, be decided during his
                                absence.</p>
                            <p>Believing it his duty to state sincerely, as he has done ever since
                                the announcement of the appointment of Ambassador Daniels, that the
                                lack of an agreement in this matter is the greatest obstacle toward
                                the best development of the excellent relations of friendship and of
                                the marked spirit of cooperation which exist between the Governments
                                and peoples of the United States and Mexico; and making bold to
                                point out the inconveniences and risks of friction which the Claims
                                Commissions have meant for Mexico and the United States,
                                circumstances carefully analyzed in Puig’s memorandum to Ambassador
                                    Daniels<note n="32" xml:id="d432fn32">Not printed.</note>
                                (submitted) even before the presentation of the latter’s
                                credentials; and in the fullest spirit of cooperation and
                                cordiality, it is agreed to consider the new plan formulated by
                                Ambassador Daniels, which may be stated as follows: <pb n="411"

                            <p>It is a source of satisfaction to the Government of Mexico that, if
                                only as regards the Special Commission, there now appears to be an
                                agreement of opinion which, although not yet stipulated, may
                                nevertheless be perceived in the conversations and negotiations
                                carried on; and it is also a source of satisfaction that there
                                appears to exist an intention to reach a similar agreement with
                                respect to General Claims,—seeking by the new proposed Protocol, and
                                in view of the lack of lump sum totals (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >coincidencias totales</hi>), solely the means which would
                                permit a mutually satisfactory en bloc agreement in the future.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Mexico can not, however, fail to stress the
                                fundamental importance which a speedy settlement of claims matters
                                has for the desired degree of friendship and closely-knit
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>The constant state of controversy carries dangerous seed, and at the
                                outset presents obstacles to the nobly ambitious policy of
                                perfecting our international ties, in which (aim) the peoples, the
                                Presidents, and the Secretaries of State of both countries
                                especially concur.</p>
                            <p>Wherefore, it is desired even at this moment to invoke anew the
                                spirit of conciliation, concord, and active cooperation which
                                animates President Roosevelt, Secretary Hull, and Ambassador
                                Daniels, in order, if possible, and over and above the positions
                                invariably maintained by the experts, that this matter may be
                                considered from the broad view of statesmen, and that its definitive
                                influence on the relations of our peoples and governments may be
                                weighed, in a new attempt to renew conversations in regard to an en
                                bloc settlement of both Claims Commissions.</p>
                            <p>To the consideration—which, according to the verbal statement of
                                Ambassador Daniels, appears to be paramount in the mind of the
                                Department of State—that all the General Claims should be decided
                                judicially, or the parties given a hearing, which view has led to
                                the presentation of a new Protocol, there could be opposed the
                                indisputable fact that the practice of extending or transforming the
                                Commissions, leaving the judicial system operative, is now condemned
                                by <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0478"/>experience, which has
                                shown the inexpediency of a procedure which invokes the perils of
                                discussion, the prolonged life of the Commissions, and the useless
                                disbursement of considerable sums.</p>
                            <p>The observation—very reasonable from the point of view of the
                                convenience and domestic political exigencies of the United
                                States—(that it would be well) to retain for the General Claims the
                                possibility, though not immediate, of arbitration, because the
                                Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate appears to believe that a
                                judicial trial of the pending claims is necessary—might be countered
                                on the ground that perhaps there is no reason for making such a
                                distinction between the two Commissions, because what occurs in the
                                General takes place in the Special.</p>
                            <p>The explanation of the Ambassador that the main reason for his
                                desire, accepted in principle by the Department of State, to
                                liquidate the Special Claims en bloc was that he believed that it
                                behooved the two Governments to avoid political discussions such as
                                those revolving around the Huerta Government, might apply with the
                                same validity to the General Claims, which touch on constitutional
                                matters in some cases and on serious political questions in others,
                                some, like the agrarian claims, being of a nature both political and
                                constitutional; all of which seems to counsel an attempt at a
                                complete en bloc settlement (of all claims).</p>
                            <p>Having stated the foregoing, the Government of Mexico, prior to
                                indicating, as it will do in Memorandum “B” of even date, the
                                conditions which have now appeared to be acceptable in general to
                                the American Government for the en bloc settlement of the Special
                                Claims, and prior to setting forth, in Memorandum “C”, its
                                counter-proposal of Protocol, which it is agreed will be
                                simultaneous with the en bloc agreement, wishes to state that it is
                                willing at any time to negotiate for an en bloc agreement covering
                                both Commissions on the general bases of the Memorandum of September
                                21, 1933, signed by Puig, and of the memorandum presented by the
                                Oficial Mayor, Jimenez Dominguez, dated October 17, 1933,<note

                            number 15 of February 3, 1934, 3 p.m. that in connection with en bloc
                            negotiations it was considered highly desirable to press for a favorable
                            decision on the protocol suggested by the Department.</p>
                        <p>The recommendation for an en bloc settlement of both General and Special
                            Claims, which I made in my despatch number 1031 of January 26, 1934, was
                            to offer a suggestion in the event that Minister Puig might decline to
                            agree to the protocol.</p>
                        <p>Since the above date the situation has changed. Minister Puig’s counter
                            proposal involves for General Claims an agreement, with some changes, to
                            the terms of the protocol suggested by the Department, and for Special
                            Claims en bloc settlement on a basis of 2.6%. The counter proposal and
                            my recommendation are discussed at length in the Embassy’s despatch
                            number 1094 of February 10, 1934.</p>

                            of this date<note n="34" xml:id="d434fn34"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Infra</hi>,</note> concerning the proposed general claims protocol,
                            there is enclosed herewith for your use the draft of a convention
                            providing for a lump sum settlement of the special claims. This
                            convention follows the general lines indicated in Memorandum B, with
                            your despatch No. 1094 of February 10, with, of course, some essential
                            variations.</p>
                        <p>Several points are involved in this convention which require comment.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">First. The basic amount of claims upon which to compute
                                liability</hi>. This involves several somewhat difficult points. In
                            the first place, it is to be understood, of course, that the basic
                            figure from which to begin the calculation, by the deductions indicated
                            in Article IV of the convention, shall be all claims filed by the United
                            States before the Special Claims Convention. The question as to which of
                            these claims were unnecessarily or improperly filed before the Special
                            Claims Commission because of the fact that the General Claims Commission
                            had jurisdiction over them is, of course, a technical and difficult
                            question. It is not necessary, however, that this question be determined
                            at the present time. It is conceded, of course, that, on the basis of
                            admitted liability, a sufficient amount is owing by the Mexican
                            Government to consume the annual payments, at the rate provided for in
                            the convention, for a considerable number of years. It is only
                            necessary, therefore, to determine at this time the manner in which the
                            net liability is to be determined, leaving to a more propitious occasion
                            the definite determination of that amount. Provision is made in Article
                            V of the convention for such definite determination by the joint action
                            of representatives of the two Governments. This procedure applies alike
                            in the matter of determining the net amount of the claims upon which to
                            compute the liability and the actual percentage of liability to be
                            computed thereupon. It is not, of course, supposed that there has been
                            any error on the part of the Mexican Government in computing the average
                            percentage of liability on the European claims (resulting in the figure
                            of 2.65%). Nevertheless the basic amount of claims to which such
                            percentage is to be applied is so large that even so small an error as
                            one-half of one percent would amount to a difference of approximately
                            $1,500,000 in the amount of the total liability. Therefore, while the
                            Department is willing to accept the proposal of the Mexican Government
                            that American claims shall be settled by the payment of the average
                            amount found to be due on all similar European <pb n="415"
                                xml:id="pg_415" facs="0481"/>claims, it does not feel that it could
                            justify before the Senate the application of the percentage indicated by
                            the Mexican Government without making provision in the convention for a
                            careful verification of the percentage calculation by some such method
                            as that provided in Article V. In the matter of determining the basic
                            amount of the special claims and the deductions provided for in Article
                            IV of the convention, it is believed that the results of the
                            adjudications under the proposed general claims protocol and by the
                            Domestic Commission which will distribute the amount to be received from
                            Mexico under the proposed convention will afford very helpful guides,
                            and that, therefore, the appointment by the two Governments of the
                            representatives provided for in Article V of the convention might well
                            be deferred several years, without, however, interfering with the annual
                            payments to be made by the Mexican Government as provided in Article II
                            of the convention.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the deductions provided for in Article IV, it is to be
                            understood that the subparagraphs in this article have the following
                            meanings: <list>
                                <item>“<hi rend="italic">First Claims heretofore withdrawn, in the
                                        amount of $</hi> . . . . . .” This figure represents only
                                    claims withdrawn by the American agents because they had been
                                    filed too late and not claims withdrawn by the claimants
                                    themselves because of independent settlements with the Mexican
                                    Government or for other reasons.</item>
                                <item>“<hi rend="italic">Second. Claims decided, in the amount of
                                        $</hi> . . . . . .” The amount represented under this item
                                    should be the total amount of claims decided, less the Santa
                                    Isabel claims. As you are aware, this Government feels very
                                    strongly that at least some indemnity should be paid by the
                                    Government of Mexico for the atrocious murders committed in the
                                    Santa Isabel case by the agents of Pancho Villa,<note n="35"

                                    treated with great lenity but, in fact, with great consideration
                                    after the commission of these atrocities. This Government would
                                    feel less keenly on the subject were it not for the fact that
                                    the Mexican Government has agreed to pay the British Government
                                    on account of the death of certain British subjects which
                                    resulted from the same incident appropriate indemnities without
                                    regard to the matter of legal liability. Whereas the decision of
                                    the Special Claims Commission, United States and Mexico, to
                                    which reservation was made by the Agent of the United States,
                                    stated there was no legal liability on the part of the Mexican
                                    Government in connection with these cases, it is felt that a
                                    gross discrimination would be made by the Government of Mexico
                                    were it not to concede the same treatment to American citizens
                                    in this case as to British nationals, at least in principle. It
                                    is not necessary to raise any difficult or embarrassing <pb

                                    connection nor to ask that the Mexican Government take any
                                    commitments other than by the stipulation, in this provision of
                                    the convention, of the amount of deduction which shall exclude
                                    the total amount claimed in the Santa Isabel cases. The result
                                    of such fixation of amount of deduction would be simply the
                                    payment, by Mexico, on the Santa Isabel cases of the average
                                    percentage of liability or the extremely conservative amount of
                                    approximately $32,000, for the deaths of seventeen American
                                    citizens whereas the Mexican Government agreed to pay, without
                                    regard to the question of legal liability, 39,000 pesos on
                                    account of the deaths of but two British nationals. In view of
                                    the fact that the Mexican Government did agree so to pay the

                                    liability and in view of the fact that this Government has
                                    recently paid the Mexican Government liberal indemnity on
                                    account of the loss of the lives of two Mexican nationals in the

                                    Mexican Government can, with any degree of reason, object to
                                    this simple act of justice.</item>

                            are entitled <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0483"/>to equal
                            treatment. This is to be conceded. On the other hand, it is felt that
                            the agreement must include some strong incentive to make payment of the
                            instalments as they become due. The Department has, therefore,
                            suggested, in the enclosed draft of convention, the payment of interest
                            at the rate of one-fourth of one percent for the first year with an
                            increase of one-fourth of one percent for each year thereafter. The net
                            result of that provision, in the event of payment of instalments on due
                            dates, would be the following: <table rows="17" cols="4"

                        <p>As will be observed, the average percent of interest contemplated by this
                            provision is only 1.8 percent, which rate cannot be objected to by the
                            Mexican Government by any sound reasoning. There are several very good
                            reasons why this interest provision should be included, namely: <list>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">First</hi>. The question as to the
                                    advisability of such a provision has been discussed with Senator
                                    Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who
                                    expressed the view that the Convention would be much more likely
                                    to be accepted by the Senate with such a provision.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. In the event of default, the
                                    interest obligation would gradually increase not only in amount
                                    but in the applicable rate of interest, which fact should afford
                                    an important counter-balance to any local influence which might
                                    council default or delay of the payments when they become due.
                                    Such a counter-balance may prove advantageous alike to both
                                    Governments.</item>
                                <item><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>. It is not desired to establish a
                                    precedent for the waiving of interest in this class of
                                    settlements. An examination of the records with respect to such
                                    settlements in the past discloses the fact that this Government

                            (which, it is understood, the Mexican Government considers a precedent
                            for the elimination of interest in the present instance—see enclosure to
                            your despatch No. 809 of November 17, 1933<note n="46" xml:id="d434fn46"
                                >Not printed.</note>) does not, in fact, constitute such a precedent
                            since that convention provided for the payment of awards which already
                            included allowances of interest in appropriate cases.</p>
                        <p>You will appreciate, of course, that any agreement by this Government at
                            this time to the total elimination of interest in such international
                            obligations might be misinterpreted and cause embarrassment in a much
                            broader field. The application of the interest rates mentioned above to
                            the obligations of the Mexican Government to both the United States and
                            the European countries concerned would involve total interest payments
                            of but approximately $280,000 over a period of fifteen years, or less
                            than an average of $20,000 per year. While it is believed that it would
                            not be unreasonable to expect this obligation to be paid over a period
                            of ten years, it has been thought more in harmony with <pb n="419"

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to your despatch No. 1094 of
                            February 10, 1934, there is enclosed herewith as a basis for your
                            further negotiations with the Mexican Government, a redraft of the
                            proposed protocol with respect to general claims in which are embodied
                            most of the changes suggested by the Mexican Government. The
                            Department’s position with respect to all these points is fully
                            explained below.</p>
                        <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0488"/>
                        <p>Before proceeding to comment on this protocol, it is desired to emphasize
                            the facts first, that in order to proceed to the appraisals contemplated
                            by the general claims protocol it is necessary first to obtain an
                            appropriation from Congress; second, that, pursuant to general policy,
                            such appropriation can not properly be requested by the President until
                            the agreement has become definite; third, that it is the hope of the
                            President and the Congress that the latter will be able to adjourn at an
                            early date not to meet again until January, 1935; and, fourth, that
                            consequently, unless the protocol can be signed within the next few
                            weeks, it will probably be impossible to take advantage of its
                            provisions until the middle or latter part of next year, which would be
                            very regrettable. It is desired, therefore, that if any further
                            exchanges of views with respect to the terms of this protocol are
                            necessary before the signature thereof, the cable be used in that
                            connection rather than the mails.</p>
                        <p>With the urgency of the situation in mind, the protocol was originally
                            drafted with the object of including nothing therein to which the
                            Mexican Government could reasonably object, while at the same time
                            complying substantially with every reasonable desire of that Government,
                            as expressed in the past, for a rapid, simple, inexpensive disposition
                            of the general claims. The protocol has now been rewritten mainly as
                            suggested by the Mexican Government. The changes from the Mexican
                            Government’s redrafted copy are shown on enclosure one herewith as
                            follows: Those portions of the Mexican draft which it is desired to omit
                            are included <hi rend="italic">in brackets</hi>, and those portions
                            which it is desired to substitute therefor or to add are included <hi
                                rend="italic">in parentheses</hi>. Enclosure two<note n="48"
                                xml:id="d435fn48">Not printed.</note> is a redraft of the protocol
                            in final form with these changes made. The following additional comments
                            may prove helpful in making the necessary explanations to the Mexican
                            Foreign Office as to the reasons for these changes:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Preamble</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Third paragraph</hi>. Omit the following words: “even
                            in the case that the other claims may at some time be subject to formal
                            arbitration”. These words appear to be unnecessary inasmuch as by the
                            preceding words, which were added by the Mexican Government, the
                            agrarian claims are left in the identical status determined by the
                            General Claims protocol of July 18, 1932, and the Mexican Government’s
                            position on that matter is made absolutely clear. These additional and
                            somewhat ambiguous words might prove troublesome in connection with
                            those future negotiations regarding the agrarian claims which are
                            contemplated by the protocol of June 18, 1932. If, therefore, these
                            words were added for the purpose of clarity, they are unnecessary. If,
                            on the other <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0489"/>hand, they were
                            added for the purpose of amplifying the reservation with respect to
                            agrarian claims, it would be necessary to object to them because it is
                            believed that all reasonable concessions have already been made on that
                            point. The paragraph has otherwise been rewritten as suggested by the
                            Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Protocol proper</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “first”, 1st paragraph</hi>. This paragraph
                            remains as rewritten by the Mexican Government except that the words “as
                            provided by the General Claims protocol of June 18, 1932”, are inserted
                            in order to make perfectly clear that the reservation made with respect
                            to agrarian claims is exactly that provided by the protocol in
                            question.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “first”, 2d paragraph</hi>. The only change
                            made in this paragraph is a typographical correction in the interest of
                            clarity of expression—the word “as” having been substituted for “which
                            is”.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “second</hi>”. This section has been rewritten
                            exactly as desired by the Mexican Government with the exception of the
                            omission of the words “such of”, which are stricken out in order to make
                            the text correspond to the Mexican Government’s elimination of the last
                            clause of the original proposal.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “third</hi>”. This has been left entirely as
                            approved by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “fourth</hi>”. This has been left entirely as
                            approved by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “fifth</hi>”. The Department concurs in the
                            view of the Mexican Government that a limitation of time should be put
                            upon the Umpire for the completion of his work and, therefore, agrees in
                            principle to the change proposed by the Mexican Government. Inasmuch,
                            however, as only the most difficult cases would be referred to the
                            Umpire, and it is impossible to know in advance what number of cases it
                            might be necessary to refer to him, it is thought possible that a
                            provision allowing two years for his work might lead to undue delay if
                            the number of cases referred to him were small, whereas, if the number
                            so referred were large a definite fixation of the period in advance
                            might bring about the necessity for further extension conventions with
                            all the difficulty entailed in such procedure. Moreover, it is believed
                            that if the Umpire were to be required formally to assume in advance an
                            obligation to act with reasonable expedition, the result, both practical
                            and psychological, would be much better. The following substitution is,
                            therefore, strongly recommended: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Umpire shall be required to assume the obligation to decide
                                    the cases referred to him at the rate of not less than one each
                                    week and to suspend his work not more than four weeks in any one
                                    calendar year.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0490"/>
                        <p rend="flushleft">This substitution embodies the principles of the Mexican
                            Government’s proposed amendment, but, it is believed, in a more
                            practical and more effective manner. Probably not more than one hundred
                            cases would be referred to the Umpire for decision, in which event his
                            whole work would be completed within about the two year period
                            contemplated by the Mexican Government’s suggested amendment.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “fifth”, last sentence</hi>. The Department
                            notes the substitution suggested by the Mexican Government, but
                            considers that, under the present circumstances, it would be more
                            advisable to eliminate this provision entirely from the protocol. It
                            involves a question which the Department would desire to consider with
                            more deliberation than present circumstances will permit if the protocol
                            is to become effective this year and, since the protocol contemplates a
                            possible en bloc settlement, after the work of the two Commissioners
                            shall have been completed, the question as to the proper procedure for
                            the selection of an Umpire is one which may be avoided entirely by such
                            an en bloc settlement. Should such settlement then prove impossible,
                            however, the two Governments would, at that time, be able to consider
                            the matter in the light of much more definite information concerning the
                            agencies which would be agreed upon to make the selection of the Umpire
                            than at present, since, in the intervening period, there would be the
                            possibility of a complete change of personnel in the agencies heretofore
                            mentioned in this connection.</p>
                        <p>In other words, the present protocol requires the conclusion of a
                            Convention after the work of the Commissioners provided for therein
                            shall have been completed. If that Convention takes the form
                            contemplated by the first alternative mentioned in the first paragraph
                            of section “<hi rend="italic">Fifth</hi>” of the protocol, namely, of an
                            en bloc settlement, this question will not arise. If, on the other hand,
                            that Convention takes the form contemplated by the second alternative
                            mentioned in the same paragraph, the proper procedure for selecting the
                            Umpire could be considered more appropriately and more deliberately at
                            that time.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “sixth”, subparagraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>). There is added at the end of this subparagraph the
                            following words: “which shall not be later than November 1, 1934”.
                            Unless this provision is added, the signature of the protocol will still
                            leave the date of its coming into effect entirely indefinite, as a
                            consequence of which fact it would, in any event, be impossible for the
                            agencies to proceed to the organization of their work with any definite
                            schedule of accomplishment in mind. It is believed, therefore, that the
                            Mexican Government will readily agree that this provision should be
                            added. For your confidential information, it may be stated that this
                            provision is considered necessary to give the protocol a sufficient
                            degree of definiteness, after signature, to warrant a request to
                            Congress for an appropriation with which to <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425"
                                facs="0491"/>initiate the necessary preliminary work on the general
                            claims to make possible a compliance with the protocol within two years
                            after it becomes effective. It is probably inadvisable to explain this
                            latter point to the Mexican Government. It is desired, however, that you
                            insist upon the inclusion of this provision.</p>

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>It is noted that the Mexican Government has suggested the elimination of
                            a provision for the filing of rebuttal evidence with the Brief of the
                            claimant Government on the ground that this provision makes possible the
                            presentation of evidence over an “indefinite period”. The draft protocol
                            submitted by the United States contemplated a reduction in the number of
                            pleadings by eliminating the presentation of Replies and providing for
                            the filing, with the claimant’s next succeeding document, rebuttal
                            evidence which has ordinarily accompanied Replies. This procedure was
                            followed with satisfactory results in the recent arbitration between the
                            United States and Panama, was not found objectionable by either side,
                            and tended to expedite the completion of cases for hearing.</p>
                        <p>It would seem fundamental that the issues of fact should be clarified as
                            much as possible in order that the Commissioners, or the Umpire, may
                            find it possible to reach a just appraisement of the rights of both
                            Governments. The Department is impressed by the fact that, in the
                            arbitral proceedings thus far conducted, both Governments have found it
                            imperative, in certain cases, to submit evidence after all pleadings and
                            briefs had been completed. And despite the liberality of the practice
                            heretofore followed in this regard, it is significant that the
                            Commission frequently found it necessary to order the production of
                            still further evidence to clarify important questions of fact in dispute
                            between the parties.</p>
                        <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0492"/>
                        <p>Aside from the fact that the procedure suggested by the United States
                            does not, as alleged by Mexico, provide an indefinite period for the
                            filing of evidence, it is believed that the inclusion of a provision for
                            the filing of rebuttal evidence is necessary to safeguard the rights of
                            both Governments. As a practical example of the necessity for such a
                            provision, attention may be invited to a case which arose in a recent
                            arbitration to which the United States was a party. The point at issue
                            was that as to whether the claimant had been permitted to withdraw funds
                            on deposit to his credit in a banking institution. The respondent
                            Government submitted in evidence a document, duly executed by the
                            appropriate officials of the bank in question, certifying that the
                            claimant had withdrawn the funds in the year 1922. The claimant was able
                            to submit, in rebuttal, evidence in the nature of monthly statements of
                            account issued to him by the same bank over a period of years after
                            1922, showing that the funds in question had not been paid to him but
                            had, according to the bank’s records, remained in his account. It was
                            clear that the bank had simply made an error. The provision for the
                            filing of rebuttal evidence in that case prevented the perpetration of a
                            gross injustice as the result of that error. In the present arbitration
                            either government might present a claim, for example, on behalf of one
                            Jorge González, as a citizen, and the respondent Government might submit
                            with its answer a certificate showing that one Jorge González had long
                            since been naturalized as a citizen of the respondent Government. Under
                            the procedure suggested by Mexico, the claim must be disallowed on
                            jurisdictional grounds even though the claimant Government may possess
                            conclusive evidence that Jorge González, the claimant, and the Jorge
                            González who was naturalized, are entirely different persons.</p>
                        <p>The United States proposed that no evidence be submitted with the Brief
                            except evidence strictly in rebuttal to evidence filed with the Answer,
                            and, with a view to assuring compliance with this limitation, the
                            original draft has been amended to provide for the rejection by the
                            Commissioners, or the Umpire, of any evidence not so strictly limited in
                            character. It may be observed that in the practice heretofore followed
                            cases were frequently briefed and submitted for hearing in which the
                            right granted by the rules to file evidence with the Reply was not
                            exercised. The United States does not anticipate that the limited right
                            herein proposed shall be exercised with frequency in the future,
                            especially in the cases in which Memorials and Answers are prepared and
                            submitted under the procedure provided for in the proposed protocol.
                            However, it regards the maintenance of the right, in appropriate cases,
                            a matter of importance, not only to the United States but to Mexico as
                            well.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that there has been added an additional provision
                            authorizing the two Commissioners, or the Umpire, to order the
                            production <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0493"/>of additional
                            evidence at any time. It is not anticipated that the Mexican Government
                            will interpose any serious objection to the addition of this proposal
                            which is designed to assist the Commissioners, or Umpire, in reaching a
                            just appraisement of the claims.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “sixth”. Subparagraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                                >e</hi>) remains as left by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “sixth”, subparagraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                                >f</hi>). The Department agrees in principle to the addition made by
                            the Mexican Government. It is believed, however, that, in order to
                            remove any possibility of a criticism to the effect that the substance
                            of the general claims convention has been changed by the protocol, it is
                            preferable to express the desired addition of the Mexican Government in
                            the following language: “except in so far as concerns the matter of
                            procedure, which shall be that provided for herein”. It is to be
                            observed in this connection that the comments of the Mexican Government
                            on this change indicate clearly that what was in contemplation in making
                            the change was the procedure provided for by the protocol. This
                            substitution of language to express the wishes of the Mexican Government
                            will, therefore, doubtless be found acceptable.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “sixth”, subparagraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                                >g</hi>) left in the form accepted by the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Section “sixth”, subparagraph</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                                >h</hi>). It is noted that the Mexican Government desires to
                            eliminate the ten percent flexibility in the matter of filing claims on
                            the basis of the Agents’ advance notice with respect to the claims to be
                            filed by them. It is not believed desirable, however, to make this
                            change. While it should not occasion either Agency any difficulty, six
                            months after the initiation of the pleading work to indicate rather
                            definitely the total number of claims to be filed by its Government, it
                            is almost inevitable that unforeseen contingencies will arise to make
                            impossible an absolutely accurate statement on this point one year or
                            more before the expiration of the period for filing memorials. Unless,
                            therefore, some relaxation is made from this provision to cover such
                            contingencies, it is not improbable that the Agents might undertake to
                            provide against such contingency by notifying more claims than they
                            really intend to plead which would destroy the real purpose intended to
                            be served by this provision. The only other alternative would probably
                            be a further international agreement, the necessity for which it is
                            desirable to avoid, if possible. The very contemplation by the protocol
                            of such a possible future agreement might lead to laxity on the part of
                            the Agencies in the matter of giving advance notification. It is upon
                            the relative accuracy of such advance notifications that the systematic
                            and successful operation of the present plan largely depends.</p>

                                rend="italic">m</hi>). The Department feels that the Mexican
                            Government may have made a fundamental change in this respect without
                            due reflection as to the possibilities to result therefrom. It is the
                            almost uniform experience of this Government that, in the general
                            working of agencies in connection with the pleading of large numbers of
                            cases, there is an inclination somewhat to disregard prescribed periods
                            for the filing of pleadings. It is believed that it is reasonable to
                            expect that, in the stress of the work which will necessarily attend the
                            pleading of all the remaining general claims within a period of two
                            years, it will be found difficult, in many cases, strictly to comply,
                            within a few days, with the periods prescribed in the protocol as
                            originally drafted, namely, seventy days in each case. It would be most
                            unfortunate to permit the filing periods prescribed by the protocol to
                            remain absolutely rigid without any provision to care for emergencies
                            and yet, at the same time, to provide sufficient sanctions to impel the
                            Agents to advance the work in a systematic and orderly fashion. It is to
                            be borne in mind that there is to be no Commission to issue orders or
                            enforce the terms of the protocol and that, therefore, in the absence of
                            such sanctions in the protocol, the inevitable result of inability or
                            refusal to comply with the protocol by filing pleadings within the
                            periods prescribed would be just that kind of friction and paralysis of
                            the work which obtained in the past and which it is the whole purpose of
                            this protocol to make impossible in future. It is, therefore, desired to
                            insert as paragraph “<hi rend="italic">m</hi>” of the protocol, the
                            following provision to which, it is strongly felt, the Mexican
                            Government cannot, with good reason, object: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“(<hi rend="italic">m</hi>). In view of the herein prescribed
                                    limitations upon the time allowed for the completion of the work
                                    of the Agencies and the Commissioners, it is recognized that the
                                    success of this simplified plan of procedure depends
                                    fundamentally upon the prompt and regular filing of pleadings in
                                    accordance with the provisions of this section. It is agreed,
                                    therefore, that any pleading which shall be filed more than
                                    thirty days after the due date for the filing thereof, shall be
                                    disregarded by the Commissioners and the Umpire and that the
                                    respective case shall be considered by them upon the pleadings
                                    preceding the tardy pleading unless, by agreement of the two
                                    Governments, the continued pleading of the respective case shall
                                    be resumed.”</p>

                                    assigned for the action taken, shall be reported to the
                                    Commissioners and, in turn, to the Umpire mentioned in article 5
                                    of this Protocol, so that due notice thereof may be taken.”</p>

                        <p>The first sentence of the above has been amended to meet the objection
                            interposed by the Mexican Government. The last paragraph above, as
                            proposed by Mexico, does not appear to cover the situation contemplated
                            by the second sentence of this section as contained in the original
                            draft. That original proposal was designed to provide for the inspection
                            by one party of the originals of documents submitted, in whole or in
                            part, by the other party, while the proposal submitted by Mexico appears
                            to relate to a situation in which one party desires to present in
                            evidence documents in the possession of the other party, but not
                            introduced into evidence.</p>
                        <p>The addition proposed by Mexico appears unobjectionable and has been
                            incorporated in toto in the above provision. However, the original
                            proposal of the United States, covering a different situation, has been
                            reincorporated in an amended form but omitting provision for the making
                            of photostat copies, in order to comply with the apparent wishes of the
                            Mexican Government. Since, the Department understands, the procedure
                            contemplated by this proposal has, to a certain extent, been heretofore
                            observed by both agencies, it is not believed that the Mexican
                            Government will object to its inclusion.</p>
                        <p>The above suggestions and changes in the protocol represent a most
                            liberal attitude on the part of this Government in order to meet the
                            wishes of the Mexican Government in every reasonable respect so that <pb
                                n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0496"/>the protocol may be promptly
                            signed and put into effect. It is to be understood, and should be so
                            explained to the Mexican Government, that in the event that that
                            Government shall not promptly agree to the protocol in its present form,
                            or to such minor changes as can promptly be arranged by cable, and a
                            consequent delay results which makes it impossible to obtain from
                            Congress, during the present session, the necessary appropriation with
                            which to initiate the work on general claims this year, the Department
                            reserves the right to reconsider the protocol in its entirety in a more
                            detailed and more deliberate manner or to proceed to the adjudication of
                            the claims under the existing Convention extending the duration of the
                            General Claims Convention. It is felt that altogether too much valuable
                            time has already elapsed without sufficiently substantial
                            accomplishments in this matter and that, consequently, the present
                            situation is one which requires the prompt subordination of unessential
                            details to the essential conclusion of the work.</p>
                        <p>There is being transmitted to you under separate cover a draft of a
                            convention for a lump sum settlement of special claims,<note n="49"
                                xml:id="d435fn49"><hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi></note> as proposed
                            by the Mexican Government. You may advise the Foreign Office that the
                            Department agrees in principle to the conclusion of such a Convention,
                            providing for the settlement of American special claims by the payment
                            by Mexico of a percentage of American claims equal to the average
                            percentage found to be due by Mexico on the special claims presented by
                            the six European Governments. It may, however, require several exchanges
                            of views, by mail, to arrive at complete understanding with respect to
                            the terms of such a convention. Meanwhile, it is desired to sign the
                            general claims protocol in order that the necessary appropriation to
                            permit initiation of the general claims work may be promptly requested
                            from Congress. The Department desires, therefore, that you exert every
                            effort possible to insure the signature of the general claims protocol
                            at once and without waiting the signature of the special claims
                            convention.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Therefore</hi>, It is agreed that:</p>

                                (as provided by the general claims protocol of June 18, 1932).
                                Pending such discussion no agrarian claims will be presented to the

                                agreed upon by the two Governments by an exchange of notes, (which
                                shall not be later than November 1, 1934).</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The pleadings of each Government shall be

                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The pleadings to be filed shall be limited
                                in number to four, namely, Memorial, Answer, Brief and Reply Brief.
                                Only three copies of each need be presented to the other Agent, but
                                four additional copies shall be retained by the filing Agency for
                                possible use in future adjudication. Each copy of Memorial, Answer
                                and Brief shall be accompanied by a copy of all evidence filed with
                                the original thereof. The pleadings, which may be in either language
                                at the option of the filing Government, shall be signed by the

                                which it intends to rely. No further evidence shall be filed by
                                either side (except such evidence, with the Brief, as rebuts
                                evidence filed with the Answer. Such evidence shall be strictly
                                limited to evidence in rebuttal and there shall be explained at the
                                beginning of the Brief the alleged justification for the filing
                                thereof. If the other side desires to object to such filing, its
                                views may be set forth in the beginning of the Reply Brief, and the
                                Commissioners, or the Umpire, as the case may require, shall decide
                                the point, and if it is decided that the evidence is not in rebuttal
                                to evidence filed with the Answer, the additional evidence shall be
                                entirely disregarded in considering the merits of the claim.)</p>

                                of pleadings to a minimum in the interest of economy of time and
                                expense, it shall be the obligation of both Agents fully and clearly
                                to state in their Memorials the contention of the claimant
                                Government with respect to both the factual bases of the claims in
                                question and the legal principles upon which the claims are
                                predicated and, in the Answer, the contentions of the respondent
                                Government with regard to the existence and significance of the
                                facts which it considers to be established by the evidence and the
                                principles of law upon which the defense of the case rests. In cases

                                the decisions of the Umpire, above mentioned, the provisions of the

                                that the two-year period allowed for pleadings may be utilized in a
                                manner which shall be most equitable to both sides, each Agent
                                shall, within thirty days from the beginning of the two-year
                                pleading period, submit to the other Agent a tentative statement
                                showing the total number of Memorials and Briefs such Agent intends
                                to file. Six months after the beginning of the two-year pleading
                                period, the two Agents shall respectively submit in the same manner
                                statements setting out definitely by name and docket number the
                                claims in which it is proposed to complete the pleadings, indicating
                                those in which they intend to combine cases in the manner indicated
                                in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) above. The number of

                                the two Governments, be exceeded by more than ten percent.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) In order to enable the Agencies to

                                each Agency shall be under the obligation to file its Memorials at

                                the two-year period, thus allowing the remaining seven months of the
                                period for the completion of the pleadings in the last case
                                memorialized.</p>
                            <p>The same obligation shall attach with respect to the filing of the

                                shall be seventy days from the date of filing Memorials. The time to

                                filing the Answers. The time to be allowed for filing Reply Briefs
                                shall be seventy days from the date of filing the Briefs.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">k</hi>) In those cases in which some pleadings
                                were filed with the General Claims Commission before the date of

                                consideration the necessity of complying with the provisions of
                                paragraph (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) above.</p>
                            <p>(<hi rend="italic">l</hi>) In counting the seventy-day periods
                                mentioned in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) above, no
                                deductions shall be made for either Sundays or holidays. The date of
                                filing the above described pleadings shall be considered to be the
                                date upon which they shall be delivered at the Embassy of the other

                                the pleading shall be filed upon the next succeeding business day.
                                The two Governments shall, for this purpose, instruct their
                                respective Embassies to receive and give receipts for such pleadings

                        <p>23. Referring to Department’s instruction No. 283, March 9, 1934,
                            relating to protocol for general claims, the Foreign Office is
                            unofficially agreeable to the draft of protocol suggested by the
                            Department with the following changes:</p>
                        <p>Page 6 Department’s draft line 6<note n="50" xml:id="d436fn50"><hi

                                par. 3, 1. 7.</note> after the word “Umpire” omit all matter to the
                            end of page. In place thereof substitute a paragraph reading
                            substantially as follows: “All matters relating to the designation of an
                            Umpire, time within which his decisions should be rendered and general
                            provisions relating to his work shall be fixed <pb n="437"

                                12.</note> after the word “Answer” insert the following: “and Reply
                            Brief”. This addition would enable the responsible [<hi rend="italic"
                                >respondent</hi>] Government to present rebuttal evidence if found
                            necessary.</p>

                                    rend="italic">m</hi>), 1. 6.</note> omit the words “more than 30
                            days”. It is thought that they may lead to ambiguities in view of the
                            provisions of (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) paragraph 6.</p>
                        <p>The Foreign Office feels that for the protocol no additional powers are
                            required as described in the first paragraph of suggested protocol. Does
                            the Department concur in this and the suggested changes in the protocol?
                            Please advise by telegraph.</p>
                        <p>I had a conference with Foreign Minister Puig this afternoon at which I
                            presented the draft of the special claims convention suggested by the
                            Department in its instruction No. 282 of March 9, 1934. Minister Puig
                            indicated that there would be no difficulty regarding the protocol of
                            general claims along the lines discussed by Colonel Moreno and
                            Licenciado Sierra but that in the draft of the special convention the
                            introduction of the Santa Isabel issue reopened a situation that would
                            result in difficulties in the Mexican Senate. He stated that he had
                            anticipated simultaneous action on the protocol and convention. Minister
                            Puig stated that he would not be able to discuss with President
                            Rodriguez the matter of the general claims protocol and of the suggested
                            terms of the special convention until the return of the President to
                            Mexico City, who will not return to the city under five or six days and
                            that he would see me again on Friday, March 23, when he hoped to give to
                            me the views of the President.</p>
                        <p>I may add that not much progress can be anticipated in the negotiation
                            from March 23 to April 1st owing to the annual Spring vacation in all
                            government offices.</p>

                        <p>1. Department has no serious objection to suggested change on page 6 of
                            draft Protocol. It is assumed, however, that by “line 6” in first
                            paragraph your cable No. 23 is meant “line 5”. Since the suggested
                            substitution would occur in Article 5, it is believed that the following
                            words at the end of the suggested paragraph “Article 5 of this Protocol”
                            might be replaced by “of this Article”.</p>
                        <p>2. Department is unable to agree to the proposed change in paragraph (<hi
                                rend="italic">d</hi>), page 8, of Protocol, as explained in your 28,
                            March 17, 10 a.m. If evidence is filed by the respondent Government with
                            reply brief, it would be necessary to give the claimant Government the
                            right to file another pleading in which it could discuss the evidence
                            submitted with the reply brief. This would disrupt the whole plan of
                            simplified procedure. Paragraph (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>), as presented
                            in our draft, contemplates that all evidence shall be filed with the
                            Memorial and Answer, except that evidence may be filed with the brief to
                            rebut evidence filed with the answer. This would appear to be fair to
                            both sides, and <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0505"/>is in keeping
                            with the desire expressed by both Governments for simplified procedure.
                            Since the Agent for the defendant Government will be obligated to file
                            all of the evidence in defense of the claim with the answer, and since
                            the evidence which may be filed with the brief will be strictly limited
                            to evidence in rebuttal to that filed with the answer, the rights of the
                            respondent Government would be fully protected by the procedure set
                            forth in the draft as submitted. It is hoped that you will be able to
                            convince the Mexican Government that no change in the draft in this
                            respect should be made.</p>
                        <p>3. Department has no objection to omission of word “umpire”, second line,
                            page 9.</p>
                        <p>4. Department considers that suggestion that all matter following the
                            word “rests”, line 15, page 9, to end of paragraph, is too sweeping as
                            regards cases in which answers have already been filed. These answers
                            were filed under the old system of pleading. Many of them consisted
                            merely of a denial of the allegations in memorials. Such an answer would
                            not afford the claimant Government sufficient information on which to
                            base an adequate argument in support of the claim in the brief, since it
                            would not disclose the factual and legal defenses of the respondent
                            Government which, under such circumstances, would first appear in the
                            reply brief. It would therefore seem to be only fair that in such cases
                            the claimant Government should have an opportunity, if it should so
                            desire, to file a counter-brief. You may, if necessary, compromise on
                            the Mexican proposal by omitting from line 16, page 9, the words “or
                            hereafter filed”. Such a change would limit the filing of counter-briefs
                            to those cases in which the answers have already been filed.</p>
                        <p>5. Page 14, line 2. Department considers that the 30–day provision is
                            desirable, and will be found to be most helpful to the Agents of both
                            Governments at times when, because of involved nature and number of
                            pleadings under consideration, or other unforeseeable contingencies, it
                            may be difficult to file all the pleadings within the time specified in
                            paragraph (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) of Article 6. It is believed that a
                            comparison of the reasons for and advantages in retaining the provision
                            with those against it should satisfy the Mexican authorities that it
                            should be retained. For assistance to you in the discussion of the
                            subject with the Mexican authorities, see also the comments on pages 12
                            and 13 of instruction 283, March 9.<note n="59" xml:id="d439fn59"><hi

                        <p>6. Department concurs in view of Foreign Office that no additional powers
                            are required for the signing of the Protocol, as implied by the first
                            paragraph draft. The reference to full powers may be omitted.</p>
                        <p>7. It is hoped that the Protocol may now be agreed upon, with only those
                            changes indicated herein.</p>
                        <p>8. Special Convention:</p>
                        <pb n="440" xml:id="pg_440" facs="0506"/>
                        <p>The Department notes your report regarding the Santa Isabel cases. For
                            the reasons stated in paragraph beginning at bottom of page 2 of
                            instruction No. 282, March 2 [<hi rend="italic">9</hi>],<note n="60"
                                xml:id="d439fn60"><hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_415"
                                    >p. 415</ref>, paragraph beginning “<hi rend="italic">Second,
                                    Claims decided…”</hi></note> Department feels very strongly that
                            some provisions should be made for these cases. Department is not so
                            much concerned as to the form that such provision shall take so long as
                            the desired results are attained.</p>
                        <p>You are requested to urge this point as vigorously as possible, since
                            failure to make some provision for the Santa Isabel cases, in view of
                            the fact that an allowance was made to the British Government in cases
                            growing out of the same incident, might greatly jeopardize the chances
                            for obtaining Senatorial approval of the Convention.</p>
                        <p>You are, of course, aware of the necessity for prompt action,
                            particularly with respect to the Protocol concerning general claims, in
                            view of the fact that appropriations will have to be obtained for the
                            expenses of this Government. And that should be effected if possible
                            during present session of Congress.</p>

                        <p>30. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 37, March 21, 1 p.m. As
                            Embassy’s No. 1224, March 16, 1934<note n="61" xml:id="d440fn61"
                                >Despatch and its enclosures not printed.</note> is not mentioned in
                            the Department’s telegram it would seem that despatch had not been
                            received at the time the Department’s instructions were drafted and that
                            reasons advanced by the Foreign Office for suggested changes and
                            discussed in enclosure 6 of despatch had not been taken into
                            consideration. Does reading of despatch and enclosure change the point
                            of view of the Department?</p>
                        <p>In connection with special convention mentioned in paragraph 8 of the
                            Department’s telegram the Embassy does not understand “Notes your
                            recommendations regarding Santa Isabel cases”. It has refrained so far
                            from submitting to the Department any reasons pending receipt of an
                            official answer from the Foreign Office. The Embassy has only
                            transmitted the first impression of the Foreign Minister as communicated
                            verbally to the Ambassador. Foreign Minister informed Embassy on March
                            17 that as President was not returning to Mexico City as originally
                            planned the question of the protocol and convention would be taken up

                        <p>33. At a conference today with the Minister of Foreign Affairs he
                            informed me he could not discuss definitively terms of protocol and of
                            special convention until he had heard from President Rodriguez who is
                            still away. He gave me an advance copy of changes in the Department’s
                            draft on the special convention which he had submitted to the President
                            with his recommendations. Briefly the changes cover: article I to
                            simplify language; article III reducing rate of interest, although there
                            is no commitment to accept the principle of interest; article IV
                            prescribing procedure for duplicated claims; article VI making certain
                            reservations regarding evidence. I brought up again the matter of Santa
                            Isabel cases reaffirming the views of the Department as communicated in
                            the Department’s instruction Number 282 of March 9, and its telegram
                            Number 37, March 21, 1 p.m. Foreign Minister informed me he could not
                            reopen these cases which he considered closed by the decision of the
                            Commission. I also mentioned the views of the Department in its telegram
                            Number 37, of March 21 covering changes in protocol. Foreign Minister
                            informed me he would have to await recommendations from his advisers who
                            are away for the Spring annual vacations as reported in the Embassy’s
                            telegram Number 23 of March 14. Memorandum of conversation being

                            was not received before cable No. 37 of March 21 was sent but, having
                            now been received, does not seem to necessitate any change in that
                            cabled instruction. <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0508"/>Department
                            feels that the further concessions offered in that cable are all that
                            are consistent with an orderly, fair and rapid appraisal of the claims
                            and that signing of the protocol on that basis should be expedited.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            telegram No. 33 of March 24, 1934, 5 p.m., in which I made a brief
                            report of the changes suggested informally by the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs in the Department’s draft of a Convention for the en bloc
                            settlement of Special Claims. I also refer to the Embassy’s airmail
                            despatch No. 1265 of March 24, 1934,<note n="63" xml:id="d443fn1">Not

                        <p>I now forward copy of the informal document given me by the Minister and
                            embodying his suggested changes, a translation thereof, and a copy of
                            the Department’s draft of the entire Convention with the changes
                            suggested underscored.<note n="64" xml:id="d443fn2">Latter not

                        <p>At the same time, I am adding some observations on certain points of the
                            Department’s draft of the Convention which accompanied the Department’s
                            instruction No. 282 of March 9, 1934.</p>
                        <p>The draft of the Convention under Article IV, Section IV, refers to
                            “Claims Withdrawn”. The original proposal from the Foreign Office
                            provided for certain deductions including among others “Claims
                            Withdrawn”. The Department’s draft of a Convention to carry out the
                            general plan proposed by the Foreign Office also provides for “Claims
                            Withdrawn”. However, the Department’s interpretation of the term “Claims
                            Withdrawn”, as specified on page 2 of the Instruction, is to the effect
                            that there are included only claims withdrawn by the American Agent
                            because they had been filed too late and not claims withdrawn by
                            claimants themselves because of independent settlements with the Mexican
                            Agent or for other reasons (underscored, supplied).</p>
                        <p>Under “Withdrawn Claims” two groups should be taken into consideration.
                            One group includes 114 claims aggregating $10,159,922. <pb n="443"
                                xml:id="pg_443" facs="0509"/>which were docketed provisionally and
                            the filing of which was disapproved by the Commission in its decision
                            No. 3 of April 24, 1931 (Opinion[s] of Commissioners, Special
                            Commission, <ref target="#pg_39">p. 39</ref>). The other group includes
                            40 claims aggregating $1,635,117. which the records of the Commission
                            show have been withdrawn already by the Agent of the United States. A
                            list of these claims is attached as enclosure 4.<note n="65"
                                xml:id="d443fn3">Not printed.</note> Under the Department’s
                            interpretation of the terms “Claims Withdrawn”, this last group could
                            not be deducted, notwithstanding the fact that they have been withdrawn
                            already.</p>
                        <p>From discussions held in the past with the representatives of the Foreign
                            Office, it would appear that these 40 claims are among those that they
                            consider should be deducted.</p>
                        <p>Due note has been taken of the views of the Department that the
                            examination of duplicated claims and the determination of which are
                            general and which are special might be postponed for years (page 2,
                            instruction No. 282). The following observations are made in connection
                            therewith:</p>
                        <p>The terms of the General Claims Convention and of the Special Claims
                            Convention, the one hundred and thirty nine decisions rendered by the
                            General Claims Commission, and the policy followed by the American
                            Agency in the memorialization of 933 General and Special claims, which
                            include about 228 cases that have been filed General and Special,
                            establish sufficient precedents for determining now in the majority of
                            the cases which claims are General and which are Special.</p>
                        <p>Reference is also made to the analysis of General and Special Claims
                            submitted with the Embassy’s despatch No. 1135 of February 23,
                                1934,<note n="65" xml:id="d443fn4">Not printed.</note> and to the
                            supplementary analysis submitted with this despatch (Enclosure 5).<note
                                n="65" xml:id="d443fn5">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It would appear from the latest estimate that of the 1072 claims
                            aggregating $268,888,509, that have been filed General and Special,
                            approximately 326 for $182,413,089. are General Claims and 746 for
                            $86,475,420. are Special Claims. Under the circumstances the
                            postponement for two or more years to determine the exact classification
                            of claims is not deemed advisable.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I have presented and urged, in writing and orally, the views of the
                            Department that in deducting the amount of the adjudicated claims, the
                            Santa Isabel claims should be excluded. I have reported to the
                            Department the position of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he
                            could not entertain any reopening of the Santa Isabel cases which were
                            dismissed by the decision of the Special Claims Commission.</p>
                        <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0510"/>
                        <p>I desire to set forth my understanding of the case. The American and
                            British claims were presented, argued and adjudicated by corresponding
                            Claims Commissions. The American presentation of the cases was based on
                            the contention that the liability of Mexico was fixed under paragraphs 2
                            and 3 of Article III of the Convention, acts of forces. The British
                            presentation was based on paragraph 5 which involves lack of protection.
                            The decision of the American Commission did not support the contention
                            by the American Agent and the cases were dismissed. The decision of the
                            British Commission confirmed an agreement between Agents, which provides
                            for the payment of an indemnity amounting to 39,000 gold pesos for the
                            two cases involved. The two judicial decisions are the results of
                            different presentations. Moreover, Article VIII of the Special
                            Convention specifies that the High Contracting Parties agree to consider
                            the decisions of the Commission as final and conclusive. I am enclosing
                            a brief summary reviewing the decisions rendered by the American and
                            British Commissions on the Santa Isabel cases (Enclosure 6).<note n="67"
                                xml:id="d443fn6">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>Under the circumstances, it appears to me that the Santa Isabel claims
                            are <hi rend="italic">res adjudicata</hi>, and that we ought not to
                            press this point.</p>
                        <p>From past statements of the Foreign Minister and of his advisers it would
                            appear that they will insist upon the simultaneous signing of the
                            Protocol for General Claims and of the Convention for the en bloc
                            settlement of the Special Claims. There has been discussed informally
                            between Mr. Sierra and Colonel Moreno the possibility of exchanging, at
                            the time of the signing of the Protocol, notes providing for settlement
                            of the American Special Claims on the same basis as the settlement made
                            with European countries for similar claims, and specifying that the
                            details of the settlement would be covered in a Convention to be signed
                            later.</p>
                        <p>I await the instructions of the Department on the changes to the Special
                            Convention that have been suggested informally by the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, in advance of the President’s decision on the matter,
                            and on the other points raised in this despatch.</p>

                        <p>44. Your cable 33, March 24, 5 P.M. and despatches Nos. 1265 and
                                1267.<note n="71" xml:id="d444fn71">No. 1265 not printed.</note>
                            Efforts are being made to conclude the work of Congress expeditiously to
                            enable it to adjourn as early as possible in May. To obtain
                            appropriation for Mexican claims work it is necessary first to have
                            enacted an authorization for appropriation and subsequently the
                            appropriation proper, in other words, two enactments. This will probably
                            be impossible of accomplishment unless General Claims protocol is
                            concluded promptly. There appear to be no differences of importance on
                            the protocol and it is therefore desired that you use your utmost
                            endeavors to conclude it before end of week beginning April 2. You may,
                            at time of signing protocol, as suggested in your despatch No. 1267,
                            write a note giving assurance that “my Government agrees that there
                            shall be concluded as promptly as possible a convention providing for a
                            settlement of the Special Claims of the United States by the payment by
                            the Government of Mexico of a sum equivalent to the same percentage of
                            the amount of the claims in question as the amount found to be due on
                            the similar claims of Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and
                            Spain corresponds to the total amount claimed by those countries in
                            claims properly filed before the respective commissions.” Since Mexican
                            comments on proposed Special Claims Convention are only tentative
                            Department prefers to reserve final consideration thereof until you
                            advise of definite views of Mexican Government after consultation with
                            the President.</p>

                                    >i</hi>) which prescribes that all memorials should be filed
                                within the first 17 months and of (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) which

                        <p>Regarding the signing of protocol prior to signing of special convention
                            Licenciado Sierra stated that simultaneous signing was contemplated
                            under existing policies of the Minister. The matter of an exchange of
                            notes as set forth in the Department’s telegram 44 was discussed.
                            Foreign Office considers Department’s draft of notes not entirely
                            satisfactory because it is not sufficiently specific. Moreno and Sierra
                            will work on a formula that might be incorporated in a note.
                            Consideration being [apparent omission] to include in formula Articles I
                            and IV, without reference to amounts of draft, of special convention as
                            amended by the Foreign Office (see enclosure 3, Embassy’s despatch 1267,

                        <p>45. Your 34, April 2, 4 p.m. Department feels you should have no
                            difficulty in persuading Foreign Office that omission from Paragraph 6,
                            subparagraph (<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) of Protocol of the words “more
                            than 30 days” leaves the rules governing dates for filing pleadings
                            absolutely inflexible with the probably inevitable consequence that
                            unnecessary difficulties will arise and disputes result in cases in
                            which it becomes impossible to file pleadings exactly on due dates. It
                            is not, of course, contemplated that the 30-day relaxation provision
                            shall apply to memorials nor be availed of in subsequent pleadings
                            except in cases of unforeseen emergency. Consequently the objections
                            offered by Mexican Government are more theoretical than real. The
                            purpose of the whole protocol is to facilitate disposition of the claims
                            without causes for friction or misunderstanding and for that reason it
                            is felt that the omission of the words “more than 30 days” would be out
                            of harmony with the whole spirit of the agreements. This clause cannot
                            result in any inconvenience to either side nor prolong the general work,
                            and the advantages of such a small degree of flexibility of procedure
                            should be obvious.</p>
                        <p>In drafting notes regarding Special Claims Convention which are proposed
                            to be exchanged at time of signing protocol, the possibility of having
                            individual claims carefully checked both as to amount and jurisdiction
                            before definitely fixing total amount of Special Claims liability should
                            be preserved. Department cannot agree that definite determination as to
                            whether particular claims are special or general and the definite
                            percentage of liability can be determined in present haste of
                            negotiations. These are vitally important matters which do not need to
                            be determined at present and which must be determined more leisurely.
                            Reference is made in this connection to page 3 of your despatch

                            Office withdraws its prior proposal that 30-day period be omitted

                        <p>2. Yesterday and today I conferred with Minister of Foreign Affairs. He
                            would have preferred simultaneous signing of protocol for general claims
                            and of convention for special completed in accordance with the expressed
                            previous views of the President. However, in the spirit of cooperation
                            he is agreeable to an exchange of notes at the time of signature of
                            protocol and pending further negotiations and early conclusion of a
                            convention. He is willing to accept a note couched in terms of his
                            suggested changes in Articles I and IV of the Department’s draft of
                            convention. The preamble of note would read as follows:</p>

                            General Claims Convention of September 8, 1923, my Government agrees
                            that there shall be concluded as promptly as possible a convention
                            providing for the en bloc settlement of the claims of the United States
                            covered by the Special Claims Convention of September 10, 1923, said
                            settlement to be in accordance with the following general principle.[“]
                            Paragraph A would be substantially Article I of enclosure 3, despatch
                            1267. Paragraph B would read: First, claims withdrawn; second, claims
                            decided; third, as in Department’s draft; fourth, as shown on page 4 of
                            enclosure 3. Paragraph C would read: “The proportionate amount to be
                            paid under A and the deductions to be under B shall be determined by a
                            representative duly appointed by each Government, whose joint report,
                            after due conference and consideration, shall be accepted as final.” It
                            will be seen that paragraph C above incorporates certain provisions of
                            the treaty.</p>
                        <p>3. Careful check of English and Spanish texts of the protocol has been
                            made with Foreign Office. Some changes have been approved heretofore by
                            the Department. Others are designed to clarify and convey the equivalent
                            Spanish term.</p>
                        <p>Referring to enclosure Department’s instruction No. 283 of March 9, 1934,
                            the following changes should be noted: Page 3 line 15<note n="74"

                            binding. All matters relating to the designation of an Umpire, time

                            rests”, substitute therefor “the facts in the case and legal principles
                            upon which the defence of the case rests.” This phraseology corresponds

                        <p>47. Your No. 35, April 4, 4 p.m. If, as appears, your cable includes all
                            suggested changes in our draft of Protocol, it would seem to be
                            acceptable as now agreed upon by Mexico. However, before authorizing you
                            to sign, Department desires to check air mail copy.</p>
                        <p>With reference to proposed exchange of notes regarding Special Claims
                            Convention, it is to be observed that these notes, as drafted, include
                            those terms of the Convention which Mexican Government desires but omit
                            all reference to those provisions in which this Government is
                            interested. Exchange of notes in these terms would leave this Government
                            in an embarrassing position with reference to the balance of the
                            Convention and, as it is believed that sufficient time remains to obtain
                            appropriation if Protocol and Convention can be signed by middle or end
                            of next week, Department desires you to do utmost possible with a view
                            to concluding both agreements within that time in accordance with the
                            following suggested changes in the Special Claims Convention.</p>

                        <p>Referring to form of Convention contained in enclosure 3 with your
                            despatch No. 1267,<note n="88" xml:id="d448fn88">Enclosure 3 with
                                despatch No. 1267 not printed; but see American draft, <ref
                                    target="#pg_419">p. 419</ref>, and the draft as modified by the
                                Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, <ref target="#pg_444">p.
                                    444</ref>.</note> following should be added to first paragraph
                            of Article I: “In computing the total sum claimed by the Governments
                            mentioned above, deduction shall be made of all claims corresponding to
                            those mentioned in paragraphs first and third of Article IV hereof.”
                            This is essential to avoid possibility of computing European percentage
                            on a total of claims including those corresponding to deducted American
                            claims, which would not, of course, be in accordance with the present
                            understanding of the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>Article II. No changes.</p>
                        <p>Article III. Add “In the event of failure to make annual payments when
                            due, however, this rate shall be increased at the rate of one-fourth of
                            one percent per annum on the amount of deferred payments during the
                            period of any such delay until a maximum additional rate of three
                            percent on such overdue amounts is reached.”</p>
                        <p>Article IV. No change except elimination of amounts in paragraphs first
                            and second, but paragraph fourth, as redrafted, is not clear. Please
                            cable at once origin and intent of this latter paragraph, whereupon
                            further comments will be sent you.</p>
                        <p>Article V. Should read “The total amount of the special claims of the
                            United States, as well as the deductions to be made therefrom, in
                            accordance with Article IV above, and the proportionate amount thereof
                            to be paid in accordance with Article 1 above, shall be determined, et
                            cetera,” continuing as quoted in your cable No. 35. Since no gross
                            amount of special claims is fixed in the Convention, this change is
                            necessary to make clear the powers and duties of the Committee referred
                            to in Article V.</p>
                        <p>Article VI. Mexican amendment is accepted, but understanding should be
                            arrived at in writing to the effect that the reservation with respect to
                            the evidence will not be availed of to deprive the United States of such
                            evidence except in cases in which the withholding thereof may be
                            required by considerations of real political importance to the
                            Government of Mexico. This understanding is considered necessary as a
                            reasonable control upon the judgment of such, now unknown, persons as
                            may have the decision in these matters in the future and may not be in
                            harmony with the spirit which pervades the negotiation of these
                            agreements.</p>
                        <p>Please emphasize, in connection with the foregoing, that every concession
                            possible is being made to meet the wishes of the Mexican Government in
                            the matter of the simultaneous signing of the two agreements, pointing
                            out that the Department has abandoned further contention with respect to
                            the obvious discrimination against this <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452"
                                facs="0518"/>Government in Santa Isabel cases, also by reduction of
                            interest to a maximum of one percent, except in case of default, and in
                            the matter of evidence. With these concessions it is not believed you
                            should encounter much difficulty in obtaining prompt agreement to the
                            Convention in amended form. Please use your full resources and ingenuity
                            to avoid further formal exchange of views on the matter of interest. The
                            purpose of the indicated addition to Article III will be obvious to you,
                            and it is hoped that you will, if necessary, use your full personal
                            influence to obtain acceptance of this amendment.</p>
                        <p>Confident of your ability to conclude Convention on the indicated bases
                            after a further clarification of paragraph 4 of Article IV, full powers
                            are being sent in order that signature may be consummated at earliest
                            possible date.</p>

                        <p>38. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 47, April 7, 1 p.m. Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs agrees to following Department’s changes to Special
                            Convention:</p>
                        <p>In Article III to interest; in Article IV to omission of amounts; Article
                            V as revised by the Department. Agreeable to an exchange of notes in the
                            sense of the Department’s interpretation of Article VI. Regarding
                            proposed addition to Article I, Minister takes position that suggested
                            insertion introduces a new stipulation in the principle of a settlement
                            based on the general percentage average of the settlements with European
                            nations approximately 2.6 percent and it will require further study of
                            the effect of the proposal and subsequent consultation with the
                            President before he can give decision. If proposed change in Article I
                            is eliminated he is ready to sign convention.</p>
                        <p>With reference to statement in the Department’s telegram regarding
                            present understanding of the two Governments may I point out that from
                            the beginning of en bloc negotiations the discussion has been predicated
                            on a settlement based on a general average of approximately 2.6 percent
                            without any mention of any deduction to European claims as in the case
                            of American claims. Any disadvantage accruing to American claimants is
                            more than compensated by provisions of the convention to the effect that
                            the deduction of claims duplicated on jurisdiction grounds will be
                            determined later by joint committee instead of deducting 50 percent of
                            the value of duplicated claims as originally proposed.</p>
                        <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0519"/>
                        <p>Regarding section 4 of Article No. IV, it was originated by the Foreign
                            Office which advises that it is intended to make clear that in
                            eliminating from the proposed convention those claims that might be
                            general the final jurisdiction and validity of such claims should be
                            determined by the terms of the General Convention and protocol and not
                            by any provision of the convention under consideration.</p>
                        <p>In view of the substantial progress made in today’s negotiations towards
                            a final convention and of my understanding of the antecedents I
                            earnestly hope that the Department will agree to the omission of the
                            change in Article I otherwise the negotiations will be delayed with no
                            assurance of gaining the point. I await the instructions of the
                            Department.</p>

                        <p>50. Your cable No. 38 and despatch No. 1301, April 5.<note n="89"
                                xml:id="d450fn89">Despatch No. 1301 not printed.</note> Form of
                            protocol with that despatch will be correct for signature after the
                            following verbal changes. [Verbal changes which here follow are
                            omitted.]</p>
                        <p>It is feared that there is a misunderstanding regarding proposed addition
                            to paragraph 1, Article I of the Convention. The fundamental principle
                            underlying the en bloc settlement of special claims is, of course,
                            equality of treatment with European countries. Clearly, such equality
                            would not result by computing the percentage of payment on different
                            bases for European countries and for the United States. Since the total
                            of our special claims is approximately three hundred millions, a
                            difference of one-half of one percent in the basic rate amounts to one
                            and one-half million dollars of liability. It is therefore of the
                            greatest importance that the calculation of the basic percentage of
                            liability shall be done with accuracy. It has been assumed all along, of
                            course, that the same method of computation would be applied to European
                            claims as to American claims—otherwise the basic consideration of
                            equality would be destroyed. The indicated addition was suggested merely
                            for the purpose of removing any doubts on this subject at the time of
                            actual computation by the Joint Committee provided for in Article V of
                            the Convention. It is incomprehensible how the Mexican Government can
                            think this addition involves any change of principle. While, as you say,
                            there have been certain discussions with respect to a “general average
                            of approximately <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0520"/>2.6 percent”,
                            it has been the basic theory that the question of approximation must be
                            reduced to a certainty by the Joint Committee. That process requires a
                            precise formula. It is only desired that that formula should represent
                            the basic principle of the Convention, namely, equality of treatment.
                            With this explanation, it is believed the objection of the Mexican
                            Government will be admitted to be untenable.</p>
                        <p>With reference to paragraph 4 of Article IV of the Convention please note
                            the following: supposing claim A for $100,000 is eliminated from special
                            claims settlement because it “in fact or apparently should have been
                            registered only with the General Claims Commission”, but suppose the
                            Commissioners provided for in the protocol should, in applying General
                            Claims Convention, as provided in this provision, find they have no
                            jurisdiction because claim is actually special. The result would be, of
                            course, complete elimination of that claim from both sides as basis for
                            possible liability. That fact will doubtless establish the necessity for
                            alteration in the terms of Mexico’s proposed substitute for paragraph 4,
                            Article IV.</p>
                        <p>The provision, as originally drafted, was based on the theory that the
                            Commissioners or Umpire having definitely determined in advance which
                            claims were properly classified as general claims before the Joint
                            Committee would be called upon to make the final computation of
                            liability on the special claims. In view of the apparent desire of the
                            Mexican Government to have the Joint Committee begin its work promptly
                            after exchange of ratifications of the Convention, this Government would
                            be willing to accept Mexico’s substitute for paragraph 4, Article IV
                            with the following addition thereto: “or the Special Claims Convention
                            of September 10, 1923 and the Protocol of June 18, 1932, in the event it
                            shall be found by the Commissioners or Umpire to have been improperly
                            eliminated from the special claims settlement”. This seems to be the
                            only means of avoiding the unfortunate possibility indicated above. Also
                            add “case” after “determined in each” in third line from bottom of this
                            provision as contained in Enclosure 3 with despatch 1267 and also
                            correct the date from 1924 to 1923.<note n="90" xml:id="d450fn90"

                                Spain shall be multiplied by 100 and the product shall be divided by

                                of this Convention) and the resulting products shall be divided by

                        <p>41. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 50, April 11, 11 a.m.,
                            Department’s suggested addition to fourth paragraph of article No. IV is
                            acceptable to Foreign Office which in turn suggests the following
                            addition to follow Department’s paragraph: “In the latter event, the
                            claims improperly eliminated in the opinion of the Commissioners or
                            Umpire, shall be settled and adjusted by the same en bloc procedure
                            prescribed by this Convention for all claims registered with the Special
                            Commission.”</p>
                        <p>Foreign Office suggests another addition in said paragraph. Refer to
                            enclosure 3, despatch 1277 [<hi rend="italic">1267</hi>]<note n="91"

                            considers that it raises a new issue and increases Mexico’s anticipated
                            estimated liability in the settlement with the United States.

                            misunderstanding as to intention and purpose of proposed addition to
                            paragraph 1 Article I of Special Claims Convention. The intended effect
                            is this: Since, in calculating net total of American Special Claims on
                            which to compute <pb n="459" xml:id="pg_459" facs="0525"/>the total
                            liability, certain deductions are to be made under paragraphs first and
                            third of Article IV of the Convention, it is but natural and proper that
                            the same process should be used in arriving at the percentage of
                            liability found to exist on the European claims. For example: If gross
                            European claims were 380 millions as shown in Annex 17 to enclosure with
                            instruction No. 214 of December 16,<note n="95" xml:id="d453fn95">For
                                instruction No. 214 and its enclosed draft protocol regarding

                                under reference not printed.</note> and that amount included fifty
                            million dollars of claims corresponding to American claims to be
                            deducted under paragraphs first and third of Article IV of proposed
                            convention, then the European percentage of liability should be computed
                            on the net of 380 less 50 or 330 millions, making a difference of
                            approximately one-third of one percent on the basic percentage of
                            liability or of one million dollars in net liability to the United
                            States. It is not a question of figures to be included in the Convention
                            but merely a determination of principles which will carry out the
                            intention of both Governments to fix liability to United States on a
                            basis of equality with European countries. This is fundamental. Will
                            communicate later regarding terms of Article IV.</p>

                        <p>43. Supplementing my telegram No. 41, April 13, 4 p.m. Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs told me this morning that in order to bring negotiations
                            to a successful conclusion he proposed in lieu of addition in article I
                            of the convention as suggested by the Department, namely, “In computing
                            the total sum claimed by the Governments mentioned above, deduction
                            shall be made of all claims corresponding to those mentioned in
                            paragraphs first and third of article IV”, that article IV be amended by
                            eliminating paragraph First: “Claims heretofore withdrawn”.</p>
                        <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs points out that agreement of Mexican
                            Government to pay in dollars and a nominal rate increases the
                            obligations of the Mexican Government to the United States and are
                            stipulations not contemplated in settlements with European
                            governments.</p>
                        <p>From the questions raised by Foreign Office in the discussions relating
                            to the Department’s suggested addition I am confident that the latest
                            proposal from the Minister is the best we can hope for, consequently I
                            trust it will be approved by the Department. It is requested <pb n="460"
                                xml:id="pg_460" facs="0526"/>that I be advised without delay of the
                            decision of the Department in order that the preparation by the Foreign
                            Office of the protocol and convention may be expedited.</p>

                        <p>44. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 52, April 14, 2 p.m., received
                            after Embassy’s telegram 43 April 14, 3 p.m., was sent.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s position regarding the principle of equality of
                            treatment for American claimants as in the case of European claimants as
                            discussed in the Department’s telegrams 47, April 7, 1 p.m. and No. 50,
                            April 11, 11 a.m., is thoroughly understood; has received most careful
                            consideration; and has been pressed in discussions with the Foreign
                            Office officials. They, in turn, point out that strict application of
                            principle ought to take into consideration that in contemplated
                            negotiations with foreign governments, except Belgian, which has been
                            paid, the plan under consideration involves payment in pesos and no
                            interest, while under proposed convention payments to the United States
                            are to be in dollars with a nominal rate of interest. However, I have
                            persuaded the Minister not to raise the foregoing point and he, in order
                            to bring negotiations to a successful conclusion, proposes that the
                            value of American withdrawn claims be not deducted from the total
                            amount; in other words that paragraph 1 of Article No. IV be omitted.
                            The value of these claims is approximately $1,600,000. The American
                            duplicated claims total slightly over $5,500,000. Deduction of this
                            amount from the total registered claims before applying the average
                            percentage of about 2.6 results in the United; States recovering about
                            $143,000 less in the final settlement. The Embassy has no definite
                            figures regarding the total amount of European claims that were
                            withdrawn or duplicated. It has estimated that the withdrawn claims
                            aggregate about 30,000,000 pesos which would raise the recovery
                            percentage from about 2.6 to about 2.8. The compilation of pertinent
                            data has not been completed by Foreign Office. May I point out that the
                            en bloc proposal presented to the Foreign Office by former Ambassador
                            Clark and which had the approval of the Department provided for the
                            deduction of the value of American claims that had been adjudicated,
                            withdrawn and duplicated and that similar deductions were not made in
                            the totals of past adjudications which were the basis for determining
                            the average percentage <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0527"/>of
                            recovery proposed by American Government. Moreover, in the discussions
                            held with the Foreign Office since September 1933 when the present
                            Mexican proposal was first received, the question of making deductions
                            from the European settlement for claims withdrawn and duplicated as in
                            the case of American claims was never brought up nor did it enter into
                            computations made at the time as to what our recovery would be.</p>
                        <p>Previous estimates as to the net total amount of special claims and which
                            are the basis of Department’s estimate of $300,000,000 (Department’s
                            telegram 50) need revision. Above figure was based on a classification
                            that one-half of the total amount of claims withdrawn in filing on
                            account of jurisdictional grounds correspond to special claims and the
                            other half to general. The total amount of said claims was estimated
                            originally to be approximately $236,000,000. Present estimates now
                            closer to 269,000,000. It is believed that about 182,500,000 may be
                            regarded as general and about 86,500,000 special. Under this basis the
                            net total amount of special claims is approximately $229,000,000 instead
                            of 300,000,000.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment the Department’s decision in the matter should not be
                            limited to the effect on the special claims but ought also to take into
                            consideration its effect on Mexican cooperation toward other pending
                            problems between the two Governments and prospective negotiations
                            codifying [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] with their adjustment, such as:
                            diplomatic discussions of agrarian claims, final settlement of general
                            claims following their evaluation under the terms of the protocol,
                            Chamizal award, distribution of waters of the Rio Colorado and of Lower
                            Rio Grande.</p>
                        <p>From my knowledge of the situation and of local conditions I am confident
                            that the latest comprehensive suggestion from the Minister is as good as
                            we can hope for, although it may not be ideal.</p>

                        <p>54. Referring to your cables numbers 41, 43 and 44 of April 13, April 14
                            and April 15. In a last effort to meet every reasonable expectation of
                            the Mexican Government the Department proposes the following changes in
                            the Convention, reference being made to the last draft thereof which was
                            transmitted with air mail instruction No. 321 of April 11.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">First</hi>. Omit last sentence of paragraph 1 of
                            Article I.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="italic">Second</hi>. Omit entire contents of Article IV and
                            substitute therefor the following: “In computing the percentage of
                            liability on the abovementioned European claims and, on the basis of
                            that percentage, the amount of liability on American claims, no
                            deductions shall be made from the total claims in either case, except,
                            in the case of the United States, of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the
                            amount of decided cases, and of (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the total
                            amount of those claims improperly filed as special claims, because
                            coming within the jurisdiction of the General Claims Commission under
                            the terms of the General Claims Convention of September 8, 1923.</p>
                        <p>“The determination of the question as to which of those claims filed both
                            general and special, shall be deducted from the total of the special
                            claims, shall be made in the manner provided in Article V hereof.”</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>. Add to Article V the following: “If the
                            Joint Committee shall be unable to agree as to whether a particular
                            claim which has been filed both general and special properly belongs in
                            the group of special claims or in that of general claims such claim
                            shall be treated as a general claim and shall be adjudicated and settled
                            in the same manner as other general claims under the provisions of the
                            General Claims Convention of September 8, 1923, and the protocol of
                            1934.”</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that omission first above is complete concession to the
                            wishes of the Mexican Government in this respect. Deduction of decided
                            cases is also a complete although improper concession to the
                            sensibilities of the Mexican Government because of the Santa Isabel
                            cases. Since lump sum percentage represents proper average recovery on
                            all cases good and bad the elimination of cases designated by decisions
                            as unfounded merely deprives this government of the corresponding
                            percentage of recovery to apply to good cases. There may still remain
                            minor points upon which Mexican Government may not be completely
                            satisfied. But it might be pointed out that successful negotiation of
                            such difficult questions of international difference involves
                            concessions on both sides and that no time remains for protracted
                            discussion of minor technicalities.</p>
                        <p>Unless agreements can be concluded this week it will probably be
                            advisable to continue negotiations leisurely by mail rather than by
                            cable since possibility of appropriations during present session will
                            have virtually disappeared and probably would not justify further cable
                            communications. Full powers to sign the convention were sent you by air
                            mail April 14, and it is hoped that you can now sign both agreements
                            without further delay. Cable as soon as possible what you do.</p>

                        <p>49. In a 2-hour conference at the Foreign Office yesterday during which
                            the entire claims situation was reviewed and the acceptance of the
                            points outlined in the Department’s telegram 54, April 17, 3 p.m. urged,
                            the Foreign Minister stated that much to his regret he had reached the
                            limit of concessions and that he would prefer postponement of further
                            negotiations and that he could not sign the protocol without the
                            convention. He based his decision on the fact that the recent changes
                            and additions suggested by us had not only resulted in increasing the
                            obligations to be assumed by the Mexican Government but involved radical
                            changes from the plan originally proposed by him, a plan that was in its
                            essentials based on former Ambassador Clark’s proposal for an en bloc
                            settlement and the application of the average percentage resulting from
                            settlements made by Mexico with European Governments. The original draft
                            of the protocol and convention were prepared by the Department. During
                            the negotiations both Governments have made concessions. In my opinion
                            the concessions made by the Foreign Minister have been greater than
                            those made by the Department. I hope I can persuade him to accept the
                            convention if I am authorized to sign it with article IV with changes
                            reported in my telegrams numbers 41, April 13, 4 p.m., 43, April 14, 3
                            p.m. confirmed in subenclosure of the Embassy’s airmail despatch 1336 of
                            April 17<note n="96" xml:id="d457fn96">Despatch No. 1336 not
                                printed.</note> and Department’s suggested addition to article V
                            eliminated. While all of the Department’s suggestions have not been
                            accepted by the Minister I feel that unless we meet him on the present
                            issue the question of claims will be postponed indefinitely with no
                            assurance that the future negotiations will result in an agreement with
                            better terms than those in the present one especially in view of the
                            possible change of administration following the elections. If it meets
                            with your approval I believe that a telephone conversation, after you
                            have had opportunity to study the problem might be beneficial. If you
                            agree please telephone me at your earliest convenience.</p>

                        <p>52. Reference telephone conversation with the Undersecretary, my
                            recommendation is that Department authorize signature of convention
                            without insisting that duplicated American claims be withdrawn and that
                            claims classified as neither general or special be settled as general
                            claims. Otherwise present negotiations will be prolonged without any
                            assurance that we can secure better position. Moreover, decision in the
                            matter will affect others. Please refer to my telegram No. 49, April 19,
                            noon, and recommendation contained in my telegram 44, April 15, 4 p.m.
                            Would appreciate telegraphic instructions today.</p>

                            Taking as a basis for comment draft of Convention transmitted with
                            instruction No. 321 of April 11, Department understands the very best
                            you are able to obtain from the Mexican Government is a Convention in
                            that general form but subject to the following:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">First</hi>. Elimination of last sentence of paragraph 1
                            of Article I, on page 2.</p>

                            to United States for the elimination of the above mentioned sentence
                            from Article I.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Third</hi>. Paragraph 4 of Article IV to be left as in
                            the above mentioned draft Convention with the word “prejudice” in sixth
                            line, page 4, changed to “prejudge” and the following sentence added to
                            the Article: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the latter event, the claims improperly eliminated in the

                                    adjusted by the same en bloc procedure prescribed by this
                                    Convention for all claims registered with the Special
                                    Commission.”</p>

                        <p>This Government interprets paragraph 4 of Article IV, including the added
                            sentence quoted above, as meaning that if a particular claim <pb n="465"
                                xml:id="pg_465" facs="0531"/>is improperly classified by the Joint
                            Committee as a general claim, the General Claims Commissioners or Umpire
                            may in their judgment determine it to be a special claim rather than a
                            general claim, without adjudicating it upon the merits, in which event
                            the total amount claimed in that particular case shall be added to the
                            total of all special claims for the purpose of computing the total
                            special claims liability of the Mexican Government.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, with the foregoing interpretation of Article IV, which
                            should be confirmed with the Foreign Office; and in view of the
                            circumstances explained and the opinion expressed in your cable No. 49
                            of April 19, you are authorized to sign the Convention on these
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>This authorization is given with reluctance principally because it is not
                            felt that in these terms the Convention fully embodies the principle of
                            equality of treatment which it has been understood would be accorded to
                            the United States, and because in its present form it involves
                            unnecessary complications of procedure requiring the pleading of certain
                            cases twice under different circumstances for the purpose of obtaining
                            one adjudication on the merits.</p>
                        <p>It is believed, however, that the real necessity for progress in the
                            settlement of these long deferred matters justifies this authorization
                            as representing apparently the least sacrifice possible, under the
                            circumstances.</p>

                                    jurist for the examination and appraisal of claims based on the

                                    Governments that have been appraised by the two national

                                    appointed by each Government, whose joint report shall be
                                    accepted as final. Ratifications will be exchanged when the

                        <p>The United States of America and the United Mexican States, desiring to
                            settle and adjust amicably the claims comprehended by the terms of the
                            Special Claims Convention concluded by the two Governments on the 10th
                            day of September, 1923, without resort to the method of international
                            adjudication provided by the said agreement, have decided to enter into
                            a Convention for that purpose, and to this end have nominated as their
                            Plenipotentiaries:</p>
                        <p>The President of the United States:</p>
                        <p>The Honorable Josephus Daniels, Ambassador Extraordinary and
                            Plenipotentiary of the United States of America in Mexico, and</p>

                        <p>The Honorable José Manuel Puig Casauranc, Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs</p>
                        <p>Who, after having communicated to each other their respective full
                            powers, found to be in due and proper form, have agreed upon the
                            following articles:</p>
                        <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Article</hi> I</p>
                        <p>The claims of the United States of America covered by the Special Claims
                            Convention of September 10, 1923, shall be adjusted, settled and forever
                            thereafter barred from further consideration, by the payment by the
                            Government of Mexico to the Government of the United States of a sum of
                            money which shall equal the same proportion of the total amount claimed
                            by the United States in all such cases (after the deductions provided
                            for in Article IV hereof), as the proportion represented—in respect to
                            the total sum claimed by the Governments of Belgium, France, Germany,
                            Great Britain, Italy and Spain—by the total amount found to be due from
                            the Mexican Government in the settlement of similar claims and under the
                            conventions concluded with those Governments by the Government of Mexico
                            during the years from September 25, 1924 to December 5, 1930.</p>
                        <p>To determine said general average percentage resulting from the
                            settlements with said countries for similar claims, the classic
                            arithmetical procedure shall be used, that is to say, the total amount
                            awarded to Belgium, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain
                            shall be multiplied by one hundred and the product shall be divided by
                            the total amount claimed by said countries.</p>

                            ascertain the amount that Mexico should pay to the United States, said
                            percentage shall be multiplied by the total amount claimed by the United
                            States (after the deductions provided for in Article IV of this
                            Convention) and the resulting products shall be divided by one

                            Umpire may in their judgment determine it to be a Special Claim rather

                            event the total amount claimed in that particular case shall be added to
                            the total of all Special Claims for the purpose of computing the total

                            Protocol:</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whereas</hi>, It is the desire of the two
                            Governments to settle and liquidate as promptly as possible those claims
                            of each Government against the other which are comprehended by, and
                            which have been filed in pursuance of, the General Claims Convention
                            between the two Governments, concluded on September 8, 1923;</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whereas</hi>, It is not considered expedient to
                            proceed, at the present time, to the formal arbitration of the said
                            claims in the manner provided in that Convention;</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whereas</hi>, It is considered to be conducive to
                            the best interests of the two Governments, to preserve the <hi

                            mentioned and the Convention extending the duration thereof, which
                            latter was concluded on June 18, 1932, as well as the agreement relating
                            to agrarian claims under Article I of the additional Protocol of June
                            18, 1932;</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whereas</hi>, It is advisable to endeavor to effect
                            a more expeditious and more economical disposition of the claims, either
                            by means of an en bloc settlement or a more simplified method of

                            the numerous claims the available information is not such as to permit
                            the two Governments to appraise their true value with sufficient
                            accuracy to permit of the successful negotiation of an en bloc
                            settlement thereof at the present time;</p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Therefore</hi>, It is agreed that:</p>
                        <p>First.—The two Governments will proceed to an informal discussion of the
                            agrarian claims now pending before the General Claims Commission, with a
                            view to making an adjustment thereof that shall be consistent with the
                            rights and equities of the claimants and the rights and obligations of
                            the Mexican Government, as provided by the General Claims Protocol of
                            June 18, 1932. Pending such discussion no agrarian claims will be
                            presented to the Commissioners referred to in Clause Third nor, in turn,
                            to the Umpire referred to in Clause Fifth of this Protocol; but
                            memorials of cases not yet memorialized may be filed in order to
                            regularize the awards made upon the agreed adjustments.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, the subsequent provisions of this Protocol shall apply to
                            agrarian claims only insofar as they do not conflict with the status
                            thereof, as exclusively fixed by the terms of the agreed Article I of
                            the additional protocol to the extension of the General Claims
                            Convention, signed June 18, 1932.</p>
                        <p>Second.—The two Governments shall proceed, in accordance with the
                            provisions of clause Sixth below, promptly to complete the written <pb
                                n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0538"/>pleadings and briefs in the
                            remaining unpleaded and incompletely pleaded cases.</p>
                        <p>Third.—Each Government shall promptly designate, from among its own
                            nationals, a Commissioner, who shall be an outstanding jurist and whose
                            function it shall be to appraise, on their merits, as rapidly as
                            possible, the claims of both Governments which have already been fully
                            pleaded and briefed and those in which the pleadings and briefs shall be
                            completed in accordance herewith.</p>
                        <p>Fourth.—Six months before the termination of the period herein agreed
                            upon for the completion of the pleadings and briefs referred to in
                            Clause Sixth or at an earlier time should they so agree, the said
                            Commissioners shall meet, at a place to be agreed upon by them, for the
                            purpose of reconciling their appraisals. They shall, as soon as
                            possible, and not later than six months from the date of the completion
                            of the pleadings and briefs, submit to the two Governments a joint
                            report of the results of their conferences, indicating those cases in
                            which agreement has been reached by them with respect to the merits and
                            the amount of liability, if any, in the individual cases and also those
                            cases in which they shall have been unable to agree with respect to the
                            merits or the amount of liability, or both.</p>
                        <p>Fifth.—The two Governments shall, upon the basis of such joint report,
                            and with the least possible delay, conclude a convention for the final
                            disposition of the claims, which convention shall take one or the other
                            of the two following forms, namely, first, an agreement for an en bloc
                            settlement of the claims wherein there shall be stipulated the net
                            amount to be paid by either Government and the terms upon which payment
                            shall be made; or, second, an agreement for the disposition of the
                            claims upon their individual merits. In this latter event, the two
                            above-mentioned Commissioners shall be required to record their
                            agreements with respect to individual claims and the bases upon which
                            their conclusions shall have been reached, in the respective cases.</p>
                        <p>The report shall be accepted, by the convention to be concluded by the
                            two Governments, as final and conclusive dispositions of those cases.
                            With respect to those cases in which the Commissioners shall not have
                            been able to reach agreements, the two Governments shall, by the said
                            convention, agree that the pleadings and briefs in such cases, together
                            with the written views of the two Commissioners concerning the merits of
                            the respective claims, be referred to an Umpire, whose written decisions
                            shall also be accepted by both Governments as final and binding. All
                            matters relating to the designation of an Umpire, time within which his
                            decisions should be rendered and general provisions relating to his work
                            shall be fixed in a Convention to be negotiated under provisions of this
                            Clause.</p>
                        <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0539"/>
                        <p>Sixth.—The procedure to be followed in the development of the pleadings
                            and briefs, which procedure shall be scrupulously observed by the Agents
                            of the two Governments, shall be the following:</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The time allowed for the completion of the
                            pleadings and briefs shall be two years counting from a date hereafter
                            to be agreed upon by the two Governments by an exchange of notes, which
                            shall not be later than November 1, 1934.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) The pleadings and briefs of each Government
                            shall be filed at the Embassy of the other Government.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The pleadings and briefs to be filed shall be
                            limited in number to four, namely, Memorial, Answer, Brief and Reply
                            Brief. Only three copies of each need be presented to the other Agent,
                            but four additional copies shall be retained by the filing Agency for
                            possible use in future adjudication. Each copy of Memorial, Answer and
                            Brief shall be accompanied by a copy of all evidence filed with the
                            original thereof. The pleadings and briefs, which may be in either
                            English or Spanish at the option of the filing Government, shall be
                            signed by the respective Agents or properly designated substitutes.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) With the Memorial the claimant Government
                            shall file all the evidence on which it intends to reply. With the
                            Answer the respondent Government shall file all the evidence upon which
                            it intends to rely. No further evidence shall be filed by either side
                            except such evidence, with the Brief, as rebuts evidence filed with the
                            Answer. Such evidence shall be strictly limited to evidence in rebuttal
                            and there shall be explained at the beginning of the Brief the alleged
                            justification for the filing thereof. If the other side desires to
                            object to such filing, its views may be set forth in the beginning of
                            the Reply Brief, and the Commissioners, or the Umpire, as the case may
                            require, shall decide the point, and if it is decided that the evidence
                            is not in rebuttal to evidence filed with the Answer, the additional
                            evidence shall be entirely disregarded in considering the merits of the
                            claim.</p>
                        <p>The Commissioners may at any time order the production of further
                            evidence.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) In view of the desire to reduce the number of
                            pleadings and briefs to a minimum in the interest of economy of time and
                            expense, it shall be the obligation of both Agents fully and clearly to
                            state in their Memorials the contention of the claimant Government with
                            respect to both the factual bases of the claims in question and the
                            legal principles upon which the claims are predicated and, in the
                            Answer, the contentions of the respondent Government with regard to the
                            facts and legal principles upon which the defense of the case rests. In
                            cases in which Answers already filed do not sufficiently meet this
                            provision so as to afford the claimant Government an adequate basis for
                            preparing its legal Brief with full general knowledge of the factual and
                            legal defenses of the respondent Government, it shall have <pb n="474"
                                xml:id="pg_474" facs="0540"/>the right to file a Counter Brief
                            within thirty days following the date of filing the Reply Brief.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) For the purposes of the above pleadings and
                            briefs, as well as the appraisals and decisions of the two Commissioners
                            and the decisions of the Umpire, above mentioned, the provisions of the
                            General Claims Convention of September 8, 1923, shall be considered as
                            fully effective and binding upon the two Governments, except insofar as
                            concerns the matter of procedure, which shall be that provided for
                            herein.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) Whenever practicable, cases of a particular
                            class shall be grouped for memorializing and/or for briefing.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">h</hi>) In order that the two Agents may organize
                            their work in the most advantageous manner possible and in order that
                            the two-year period allowed for pleadings and briefs may be utilized in
                            a manner which shall be most equitable to both sides, each Agent shall,
                            within thirty days from the beginning of the two-year pleading period,
                            submit to the other Agent a tentative statement showing the total number
                            of Memorials and Briefs such Agent intends to file. Six months after the
                            beginning of the two-year pleading period, the two Agents shall
                            respectively submit in the same manner statements setting out definitely
                            by name and docket number the claims in which it is proposed to complete
                            the pleadings and briefs, indicating those in which they intend to
                            combine cases in the manner indicated in paragraph (<hi rend="italic"
                                >g</hi>) above. The number of pleadings and briefs so indicated
                            shall not, except by later agreement between the two Governments be
                            exceeded by more than ten percent.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) In order to enable the Agencies to distribute
                            their work equally over the two-year pleading period, each Agency shall
                            be under the obligation to file its Memorials at approximately equal
                            intervals during the first seventeen months of the two-year period, thus
                            allowing the remaining seven months of the period for the completion of
                            the pleadings and briefs in the last case memorialized. The same
                            obligation shall attach with respect to the filing of the pleadings and
                            briefs referred to in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">k</hi>) below.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) The time to be allowed for filing Answers
                            shall be seventy days from the date of filing Memorials. The time to be
                            allowed for filing Briefs shall be seventy days from the date of filing
                            the Answers. The time to be allowed for filing Reply Briefs shall be
                            seventy days from the date of filing the Briefs.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">k</hi>) In those cases in which some pleadings or
                            briefs were filed with the General Claims Commission before the date of
                            signature hereof, the Agency which has the right to file the next
                            pleading or brief shall <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0541"/>be
                            allowed to determine when that document shall be filed, taking into
                            consideration the necessity of complying with the provisions of
                            paragraph (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>) above.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">l</hi>) In counting the seventy-day periods mentioned
                            in paragraph (<hi rend="italic">j</hi>) above, no deductions shall be
                            made for either Sundays or holidays. The date of filing the above
                            described pleadings and briefs shall be considered to be the date upon
                            which they shall be delivered at the Embassy of the other Government. If
                            the due date shall fall on Sunday or a legal holiday, the pleading or
                            brief shall be filed upon the next succeeding business day. The two
                            Governments shall, for this purpose, instruct their respective Embassies
                            to receive and give receipts for such pleadings and briefs any weekday
                            between the hours of 10 and 16 (4 p.m.) except on the following legal
                            holidays of both countries: <table rows="12" cols="2"

                            upon the time allowed for the completion of the work of the Agencies and
                            the Commissioners, it is recognized that the success of this simplified
                            plan of procedure depends fundamentally upon the prompt and regular
                            filing of the pleadings and briefs in accordance with the provisions of
                            this Protocol. It is agreed, therefore, that any pleading or brief which
                            shall be filed more than thirty days after the due date for the filing
                            thereof, shall be disregarded by the Commissioners and the Umpire, and
                            that the respective case shall be considered by them upon the pleadings
                            and briefs preceding the tardy pleadings and briefs, unless, by
                            agreement of the two Governments, the continued pleading of the
                            respective case shall be resumed.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) It shall not be necessary to present original
                            evidence but all documents hereafter submitted as evidence shall be
                            certified as true and complete copies of the original if they be such.
                            In the event that any particular document filed is not a true and
                            complete copy of the original, that fact shall be so stated in the
                            certificate.</p>

                            either in whole or in part, shall be retained in the Agency filing the
                            document and shall be made available for inspection by any authorized
                            representative of the Agent of the other side.</p>
                        <p>(<hi rend="italic">p</hi>) Where the original of any document or other
                            proof is filed at any Government office on either side, and cannot be

                            possession of the Agent of the Government desiring to present the same
                            to the Commissioners in support of the allegations set out in his
                            pleadings or briefs, he shall notify the Agent of the other Government
                            in writing of his desire to inspect such document. Should such
                            inspection be refused, then the action taken in response to the request
                            to inspect, together with such reasons as may be assigned for the action
                            taken, shall be reported to the Commissioners and, in turn, to the

                            arrangement similar to that proposed in H. R. 1731.</p>
                        <p>In reply I may say that there appears to be no prospect of an early
                            settlement by agreement between the United States and Mexico of the
                            question of territorial sovereignty over the Chamizal area. The
                            considerations which prompted this Department in 1929 to request that
                            the matter of the acquisition by the United States of title to the
                            proposed building site in that area be held in abeyance<note n="12"

                        <p>It is believed that similar considerations would not apply to the method
                            of solving the problem suggested in H. R. 1731, as the contemplated
                            transfer of the United States inspection services from the quarters
                            which they now occupy under lease in the Chamizal tract to new leased
                            quarters in a building to be constructed in that tract and owned by
                            private parties would appear to entail no change in the international
                            status of the area in question. Moreover, provision is in the Bill for
                            the cancellation of the lease in the event that the lands leased shall
                            be determined to be subject to the jurisdiction of Mexico. However, it
                            is suggested that the private character of the building enterprise
                            should be still further emphasized by the deletion from the Bill of
                            paragraph (1) of Section one, which, of course, would involve also the
                            deletion of the final clause of Section two. With these omissions the
                            Department of State would perceive no objection to H. R. 1731 from the
                            point of view of the international relations of the United States.</p>

                                rend="italic">2</hi>], last, this Embassy had the honor to address a
                            note to Your Excellency in which, by express instructions of the Mexican
                            Chancellery, the request was renewed which the Mexican Boundary
                            Commissioner, Engineer Armando Santacruz, presented to the United States
                            Commissioner, Mr. L. M. Lawson, for the suspension of the works that
                            were being carried out on the left bank of the Rio Grande, opposite the
                            town of Presidio, in the State of Texas. The step taken by Engineer
                            Santacruz, was based on the fact that the said works were being carried
                            out on the land situated within the avulsive changes of Ojinaga and the
                            Islands of Machuca, which were separated from Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency, in a note dated February 1 last, was good enongh to
                            inform me that the said works had been suspended.</p>
                        <p>The request first made by the Mexican Commissioner, and later by this
                            Embassy, was based, principally, not on the legality or illegality of
                            the works with regard to their form and conditions, but on the fact of
                            their being situated on the land comprised in the said <pb n="481"
                                xml:id="pg_481" facs="0547"/>avulsive changes, and which, in
                            accordance with the conventions now in force between the two countries,
                            remain under the dominion and jurisdiction of Mexico, until the
                            International Boundary Commission makes the necessary decision.</p>
                        <p>In this connection my Government has given me instructions to request
                            Your Excellency to instruct the United States Commissioner, Mr. Lawson,
                            to proceed with examination of this case and to render the appropriate
                            decision.</p>
                        <p>The Mexican Commissioner, Mr. Santacruz, is prepared to undertake this
                            study.</p>
                        <p>Of the cases in which the avulsion took place some time ago, this is the
                            only one which is awaiting the decision of the International Boundary
                            Commission, and there appears to be no reason for delaying consideration
                            thereof. According to information which this Embassy has, the
                            investigation based on testimony and documents, which is necessary in
                            order to enable the Commission to make a decision determining in a
                            definitive manner to what sovereignty and jurisdiction the land in
                            question is to be subject, has now been completed.</p>
                        <p>Trusting that Your Excellency’s Government agrees with that of Mexico
                            that it is highly expedient, in order to avoid the complications that
                            might result from the uncertain status of that land, that the
                            International Boundary Commission should render the respective decision,

                            No. 2063 of May 22, 1934, advising me of the desire of the Mexican
                            Government that the American Commissioner be instructed to take the
                            necessary steps to the end that the International Boundary Commission,
                            United States and Mexico, may proceed definitely to determine the
                            sovereignty in certain lands on the left bank of the Rio Grande opposite
                            the town of Presidio, Texas, which your Government avers were involved
                            in avulsive changes of that river and are consequently under the
                            dominion and jurisdiction of Mexico, in accordance with the applicable

                        <p>As Your Excellency was informed in my note of acknowledgment dated May
                            31, 1934,<note n="14" xml:id="d471fn14">Not printed.</note> this matter
                            was duly referred for an expression <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482"
                                facs="0548"/>of his opinion and recommendations to the American
                            Commissioner. A reply has now been received from Mr. Lawson in which he
                            advises that the question of these areas is greatly complicated by the
                            obscurity and uncertainty of the existing evidence and data concerning
                            the manner in which they were formed. This opinion is corroborated by
                            the information in the files of the Department.</p>
                        <p>It occurs to me that it would be most helpful in the consideration of
                            this matter if, prior to the issuance of definitive instructions of the
                            two Governments to their respective Boundary Commissioners, an
                            examination and careful study of the existing data respecting the areas
                            might be undertaken to provide a basis for determining whether such data
                            may be sufficiently reliable and accurate to enable the Commissioners to
                            render an authoritative decision with regard to the status of the areas,
                            or whether, on the other hand, the character of the evidence disclosed
                            may be such as to render such a decision extremely difficult to reach,
                            thus pointing to the desirability of further discussion of the matter by
                            the two Governments.</p>
                        <p>In the event that this suggested procedure commends itself to Your
                            Excellency’s Government, I shall be pleased to request the American
                            Commissioner to direct one of the engineers of the American Section to

                            note of July 16th last, which you were good enough to send me in reply
                            to Note No. 2063 from this Embassy, of the preceding 22nd of May, in
                            which I had the honor, by instruction from my Government, to request
                            Your Excellency to have appropriate instructions given to the United
                            States Commissioner on the International Boundary Commission, Mr.
                            Lawson, in order that an examination might be made of the case of the
                            lands situated within the avulsive changes of Ojinaga and the Machuca
                            Islands and to have the corresponding decision made.</p>
                        <p>Your Excellency was good enough to inform me, in your kind note of July
                            16th, that everything connected with these lands is very complicated,
                            due to the vagueness and ambiguity of the existing data, and that it
                            would therefore be well for the two Governments to issue definite
                            instructions to their Commissioners to examine and study with great care
                            the data that exists respecting these lands, in order to be able to
                            establish a basis for deciding whether such data are sufficient for the
                            Commission to issue an authorized decision regarding the status of those
                            zones, or whether the character of this data is of such a nature that it
                            would be extremely difficult to reach a decision, which would indicate,
                            in Your Excellency’s opinion, the suitability of having the matter
                            discussed again by both Governments.</p>
                        <p>With respect to this, I have instructions to address Your Excellency,
                            informing you that, in the opinion of my Government, the data in the
                            possession of the Boundary Commission concerning the lands mentioned are
                            sufficient to form the basis for a decision thereon, for which reason
                            the Government of Mexico would be glad to have this case dealt with at
                            once by the said Boundary Commission.</p>

                            Excellency’s note No. 3625 of September 26, 1934, to the Department’s
                            reply of October 2, 1934,<note n="17" xml:id="d474fn17">Latter not found
                                in Department files.</note> and to prior correspondence, in relation
                            to the desire of your Government that the International Boundary
                            Commission, United States and Mexico, undertake to determine the
                            sovereignty with respect to certain lands on the left bank of the Rio
                            Grande near the town of Presidio, Texas.</p>
                        <p>Further careful study has been given to this matter by the Department, as
                            well as by the American Section of the Boundary Commission. This study
                            reveals that not only are the areas in the vicinity of Presidio obscure
                            and uncertain with respect to their status, but that there are several
                            islands among those surveyed and the nationality of which was once
                            determined by the joint action of Commissioners Emery and Salazar which
                            are believed to have now disappeared or to have become attached to
                            mainlands on one bank of the Rio Grande or the other. There are likewise
                            believed to exist other areas between Quitman Canyon and the Gulf of
                            Mexico the status of which appears not to be definitely known, thus
                            rendering ineffectual the fundamental principle of a clearly established
                            water boundary between the points mentioned. In view of these conditions
                            this Government would be disposed to join with Your Excellency’s
                            Government in issuing instructions to the Boundary Commission of such
                            scope as to embrace a joint investigation by the Boundary Commissioners
                            of the entire water boundary between Quitman Canyon and the Gulf, with
                            the view of “determining the status of the above-mentioned islands, as
                            well as to determine whether or not there are any areas which may be
                            bancos subject to the action of the Commission, in accordance with the
                            provisions of existing boundary conventions.</p>
                        <p>Since it would be in the interest of both Governments to know with
                            definiteness the status of all such areas, including those situated near
                            Presidio, I have the honor to request that Your Excellency be good
                            enough to inform the Department whether your Government would be
                            disposed to join this Government in issuing instructions to the Boundary
                            Commission in the sense above indicated.</p>

                            to this end. A circular distributed in Ensenada yesterday reads as

                        <p>A meeting is to be held tonight, at which further plans are to be
                            discussed. Reports received at the Consulate indicate that if Chinese
                            merchants do not close their shops and depart from this Territory,
                            strong and illegal measures will be employed to cause them to do so.
                            While there are some who are in favor of ridding the communities of
                            Chinese by excessive taxation and assessment of heavy fines for
                            infractions of various provisions of the Mexican Labor Law, or other
                            laws, it is doubtful that all elements will confine their activities to
                            such a procedure.</p>
                        <p>Success of the project of the Nationalist (Anti-Chinese) Committee
                            unquestionably will present to the United States the problem of dealing
                            with Chinese refugees. The Consulate is writing today to the <pb n="486"
                                xml:id="pg_486" facs="0552"/>Chief Patrol Inspector, United States
                            Immigration Service, Chula Vista, California, on this subject, and
                            encloses herewith a copy of its letter.<note n="21" xml:id="d475fn3">Not

                        <p>Should it be the policy of the United States to endeavor to prevent acts
                            of violence against the Chinese upon the grounds that such acts would
                            work a great hardship upon the United States Government, and should the
                            Department authorize me to do so, it is possible that I could convince
                            leaders of the Nationalist Committee that it would be wise for them to
                            encourage the employment of legal means to solve their problems.…</p>
                        <p>Pending the receipt of instructions from the Department, the Consulate
                            will but observe the facts.</p>

                        <p>13. Reference despatch No. 778 of January 24, 1934, from Ensenada. Unless
                            you are in possession of reliable information indicating that the
                            anticipated situation will not arise or are aware of some urgent reason
                            why such action should not be taken, the Department desires you to
                            discuss this matter with the Mexican Foreign Office, carefully pointing
                            out that your Government refrains from representations respecting the
                            purely Mexican aspects of the situation, but stating that this
                            Government hopes adequate measures will be taken to prevent the forcing
                            of Chinese into the United States from Baja California and the
                            consequent repetition of the serious difficulties caused by the forced
                            illegal entry of Chinese into this country following the anti-Chinese
                            movement in Sonora.</p>

                        <p>9. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 13, January 31, 6 p.m., the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs in a letter received last night states that
                            the chief of the Migration Service at Tijuana says that he has no
                            information that Chinese entering the United States crossing at
                            unauthorized points and that the chief of the American Immigration
                            Service has informed him that he is redoubling the guard in order to
                            prevent such entries. The Mexican agent further stated that he would
                            report immediately any new developments. The Mexican Immigration Agent
                            at Ensenada reported that he had no knowledge of entries of Chinese into
                            the United States at secret points.</p>
                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs advised me orally that the President
                            told him that the territory of Lower California being under federal
                            jurisdiction, if deportments of Chinese from that point into the United
                            States took place the Federal Government would control it.</p>

                        <p>The Department of State has received the Chinese Legation’s memorandum of
                            March 2, 1934,<note n="25" xml:id="d479fn25">Not printed.</note> in
                            regard to anti-Chinese agitation in Lower California, Mexico, in which
                            the Legation expresses the desire <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488"
                                facs="0554"/>that some arrangement be made whereby Chinese refugees
                            from that area could be admitted into the United States for a short
                            time, under such conditions as the immigration authorities may prescribe
                            in cooperation with Chinese consular officers, until it is safe for them
                            to return to Mexico.</p>
                        <p>Prior to the receipt of the memorandum mentioned, the Department had
                            received and is continuing to receive from its consular representatives
                            at Ensenada and Mexicali reports with regard to anti-Chinese agitation
                            in Lower California, Mexico. These reports indicate that American
                            consular and immigration officers are watching the situation closely and
                            are prepared to handle that situation, should occasion arise, in such
                            manner as the circumstances may require and as may be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>The Department is not prepared to suggest to the immigration authorities
                            the making of any special arrangement unless the Chinese Government
                            chooses in advance of such arrangement to place at the disposal of the
                            American Government a credit adequate to defray all expenses that such
                            arrangement may entail. Since August 1931, the American Government has
                            expended more than $500,000 to provide for the repatriation to China of
                            Chinese refugees from Mexico. This expenditure was brought to the
                            attention of the Legation on several occasions, especially in the
                            Department’s note of September 1, 1933.<note n="26" xml:id="d479fn26"

                            desires you to keep this matter actively before the attention of the
                            Mexican Foreign Office emphasizing our reliance upon its assurance given
                            you recently that adequate measures will be taken to prevent illegal
                            entries of Chinese into the United States. In your discretion you may
                            say that the recurrence of a situation similar to that which arose in
                            connection with the exodus of Chinese from Sonora would be highly
                            embarrassing to this Government and would necessarily entail the
                            adoption of protective measures which would restrict freedom of transit
                            in detriment to the interests of citizens on both sides of the
                            frontier.</p>

                        <p>29. Referring to the Department’s telegram 36, March 16, 4 p.m., the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this afternoon that the
                            President during the recent visit to Mexico City of the Governor of the
                            Northern District of Lower California had given the latter strict
                            instructions to take the necessary measures to prevent the illegal entry
                            by Chinese from his district into the United States. A full report by

                            initiated by the Department of State with certain countries with a view

                            the last ten years, necessarily impose upon my Government the duty of
                            following with attention those commercial negotiations which might
                            greatly influence the development of Nicaraguan economic life,
                            especially during this period of crisis which my country has not

                            granting each other reciprocal concessions with respect to import duties
                            on their respective products, provided in this connection for
                            most-favored-nation treatment; and, in consideration of this treatment
                            by France, Nicaragua conceded analogous treatment to French products and
                            also a specific lowering of 25 percent in the import duties on certain
                            articles especially enumerated in a list known as Table B. These
                            advantages granted to French commerce in a convention of reciprocal
                            concessions, no doubt in consideration of the circumstance that the
                            larger share of Nicaraguan <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0558"
                            />coffee was imported by France, were extended later to the products of
                            the United States by a decree of the President of Nicaragua of August
                            23, 1911, issued for the purpose of favoring North American commerce,
                            and they have been maintained almost uninterruptedly since then.</p>
                        <p>With this same tendency to favor imports from the United States,
                            reflecting a natural sympathy of the Nicaraguan people for the people of
                            the United States, the Nicaraguan customs tariff has regularly come to
                            assign to products which are essentially North American substantially
                            reduced import duties. And as a consequence of this and of the
                            preferential treatment to which I have referred above, not only has the
                            commerce of the United States come to occupy first place in my country,
                            comprising more than 62 percent of the total of Nicaraguan imports and
                            exports, but also North American products have come to be consumed in
                            Nicaragua up to 66.6 percent of the total of imports in the last ten
                            years, from January 1, 1923, to December 31, 1932, while the consumption
                            of Nicaraguan products in the United States during the same period has
                            barely reached 57.5 percent of the total of Nicaraguan exports.</p>
                        <p>In view of the imminence of the commercial arrangements mentioned at the
                            beginning and of the very great interest which Nicaragua has in them, my
                            Government considers it imperative to call Your Excellency’s attention
                            to the circumstances related to the end that Nicaragua’s profound
                            interest in them be taken into consideration, that reciprocally the
                            United States grant to Nicaraguan commerce and products treatment not
                            less favorable than that accorded to any other country of America, and
                            that no greater restrictions than those already imposed be placed on the
                            importation of its products; and my Government has given me instructions
                            to express to Your Excellency at the same time its desire not to remain
                            outside the commercial arrangements which may be celebrated but to take
                            part in them, and that under such arrangements special concessions be
                            given to it in compensation for the continued favorable treatment of the
                            commerce and products of the United States.</p>
                        <p>In accordance with those instructions, I wish to refer particularly to
                            discussions which are pending in the Department of Agriculture of the
                            United States, in execution of the act approved by Congress May 12, 1932

                            arriving at an arrangement (Marketing Agreement for Sugar Stabilization)
                            for the production, refinement and distribution of sugar, and which
                            appear to favor although perhaps without an express declaration and only
                            through an agreement creating certain defined production areas and an
                            administrative organism charged <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0559"
                            />with issuing special regulations governing them, the exclusion of
                            sugar produced in Nicaragua from importation into the United States.</p>
                        <p>Sugar is one of the principal products which Nicaragua exports and which
                            the commerce and industry of the West Coast of the United States, and
                            principally of the States of California, Oregon and Washington, use
                            preferentially, because of the special qualities of the Nicaraguan
                            product, in the preservation and packing of fruits which themselves are
                            generally destined to be exported. While the amount which Nicaragua can
                            supply to the commerce and consumption of the United States, 15,000 to
                            20,000 tons per year, is perhaps inappreciable as an element of
                            competition with other sugars, and signifies practically nothing
                            alongside of the 6,350,000 tons annually at which the internal
                            consumption of the United States is calculated, this exportation,
                            nevertheless, constitutes for my country one of the great sources of its
                            export trade and, as such, of its capacity to buy, precisely in the same
                            markets of the United States, the products which it must import. The
                            exclusion of Nicaraguan sugar from importation into the United States
                            would seriously affect the economic life of Nicaragua, depriving it of
                            resources which it needs for its importations, and in turn would
                            prejudice the quota which the commerce of the United States has freely
                            had in the Nicaraguan import trade.</p>
                        <p>As a natural consequence of the present absence of economic equilibrium,
                            the Government of Nicaragua must contemplate the probability of a
                            revision of its customs tariff and of its commercial arrangements and
                            conventions, in the near future; particularly since French merchants
                            have already solicited greater preferences in the regulation of
                            international exchange by invoking the circumstance that, while the
                            greater part of Nicaraguan coffee is imported into France, Nicaragua,
                            nevertheless, obtains the larger part of its imports from other
                            countries. Your Excellency will not fail to appreciate that the commerce
                            of my country, should the United States adopt the proposed restrictions
                            on the importation of sugar and should other countries out of fear of
                            this for the reasons which I have just expressed adopt similar
                            restrictions, would be seriously affected, and that the 66.6 percent of
                            its imports which it has been obtaining in the North American market
                            would necessarily have to be reduced, perhaps obliging it to make
                            greater concessions to those who in such a critical situation should
                            consume a larger portion of its exports or give the latter greater
                            facilities.</p>
                        <p>My Government, attentive to the request of the producers of my country
                            who are justly alarmed by the possibility that the arrangements and
                            regulations for stabilizing sugar now being discussed in the Department
                            of Agriculture may have the effect of excluding their product from
                            importation into the United States, has instructed me <pb n="494"
                                xml:id="pg_494" facs="0560"/>specifically that, in informing you of
                            its point of view and of the interest which Nicaragua has in the
                            commercial arrangements and agreements first mentioned and from which it
                            does not desire to remain apart, I should insist especially on
                            expressing to Your Excellency, in association with the Minister of
                            Finance of Nicaragua, Dr. Salvador Guerrero Montalván, who is now in
                            Washington, the well-grounded fear that without the attention of the
                            State Department the special situation and attitude of Nicaragua with
                            respect to the commerce of the United States and the importance which
                            its sugar exports have in its economic life, may be forgotten, in order
                            that opportune consideration may be given them before definite decisions
                            are made by the Department of Agriculture.</p>
                        <p>In carrying out these instructions, I suggest to Your Excellency, taking
                            advantage of the presence here of the Minister of Finance of my country,
                            the possibility of an exchange of impressions in the matter between him
                            and the respective officials of the Treasury and Agriculture
                            Departments, if, as I do not doubt, Your Excellency considers it
                            advisable from the point of view of more complete information. Trusting
                            that my Government’s interest in the matter will be sufficiently
                            appreciated by Your Excellency and that the Government of the United
                            States will recognize the basis and justice of its pretensions by giving
                            them immediate attention, I have [etc.]</p>

                            September 16, 1933, concerning the commercial relations between
                            Nicaragua and the United States. You state that your Government has
                            followed with the greatest interest the news published with reference to
                            negotiations initiated by the Department of State with certain countries
                            with a view to the celebration, on bases of reciprocity, of commercial
                            agreements contemplating mutual concessions in customs tariff matters,
                            and that in this connection your Government desires that the United
                            States grant to Nicaraguan commerce and products treatment not less
                            favorable than that accorded to any other country of America, and that
                            no greater restrictions than those at present imposed be placed on the
                            importation of Nicaraguan products. You also state that you have been
                            instructed to express the desire of your Government not to remain
                            outside the commercial agreements which may be celebrated.</p>
                        <p>You also refer to discussions now being held in the Department of
                            Agriculture of the United States, in execution of the Agricultural
                            Adjustment Act, with the object of arriving at a marketing agreement <pb
                                n="495" xml:id="pg_495" facs="0561"/>for sugar stabilization which
                            you fear would exclude sugar produced in Nicaragua from importation into
                            the United States, and you suggest the advisability of arranging for the
                            Minister of Finance of Nicaragua, Dr. Salvador Guerrero Montalván, who
                            is now in Washington, to consult with the appropriate officials of the
                            Treasury and Agriculture Departments in this connection.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States appreciates and shares the desire of
                            the Government of Nicaragua to continue and intensify the close
                            commercial relations already existing between the two countries.
                            Evidence of this desire on the part of the United States, as well as of
                            Nicaragua, is the Agreement effected by an exchange of notes of June 11,
                            and July 11, 1924, between Nicaragua and the United States, providing
                            for mutual unconditional most-favored-nation treatment in customs
                                matters.<note n="5" xml:id="d485fn5"><ref

                            is about to engage in conversations with representatives of Colombia,
                            Brazil and Argentina with the object of exploring the possibilities of
                            negotiating reciprocity agreements.<note n="6" xml:id="d485fn6">For

                            conversations are purely exploratory, however, and the United States
                            will not be able to determine whether or not it will be practicable to
                            enter into reciprocity agreements with the Governments mentioned or with
                            other governments until they are completed.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the present studies and conversations should indicate
                            the practicability of this Government’s entering into a series of
                            reciprocity agreements, it will be happy to initiate conversations with
                            the Government of Nicaragua looking to the possibility of the
                            negotiation of such an agreement.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your comments regarding the discussions being held
                            under the Agricultural Adjustment Act looking to the execution of a
                            marketing agreement for sugar stabilization, and your fears that this
                            agreement might have the effect of excluding sugar produced in Nicaragua
                            from importation into the United States, the Department has transcribed
                            the pertinent portion of your note to the Department of Agriculture and
                            will inform you of the nature of that Department’s reply when it is
                            received. In this connection, the Department of State has recommended to
                            the Department of Agriculture that the proposed marketing agreement not
                            contain any provision which would have the effect of placing an embargo
                            on the importation of full duty sugars.</p>
                        <p>With reference to your suggestion that it might be advisable for the
                            Minister of Finance of Nicaragua, Dr. Salvador Guerrero Montalván, <pb

                            expressing the interest of the Nicaraguan Government in exploratory
                            conversations regarding the possibility of concluding a trade agreement
                            between the United States and Nicaragua, and to Mr. Caffery’s reply of
                            October 5, 1933, in which it was stated that if present studies and
                            conversations should indicate the practicability of this Government’s
                            entering into a series of reciprocity agreements, it will be happy to
                            initiate conversations on this subject with the Government of
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The studies and conversations above referred to have now progressed to
                            such an extent as to make it possible to initiate exploratory
                            conversations with the Government of Nicaragua regarding the possibility
                            of concluding a reciprocal trade agreement. Preliminary studies suggest
                            that such discussions might proceed on the following basis:</p>
                        <pb n="497" xml:id="pg_497" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>Over 70% of the imports into the United States from Nicaragua consist of
                            bananas and coffee. These products are now permitted to be imported free
                            of duty. The United States might on its part, therefore, undertake in
                            the proposed agreement to continue to admit these products free of duty
                            in return for concessions by Nicaragua on products imported from the
                            United States.</p>
                        <p>Although, as indicated above, bananas and coffee are by far the most
                            important articles exported from Nicaragua to the United States, there
                            may be other products on which the Government of Nicaragua would seek
                            concessions and which it would desire to bring to the attention of the
                            United States Government in the course of the exploratory conversations.
                            However, with reference to the interest of the Government of Nicaragua
                            in the treatment to be accorded Nicaraguan cane sugar, it is necessary
                            to state that it would not be possible at this time to indicate whether
                            any provision could be made in the proposed trade agreement regarding
                            the treatment to be accorded this product.</p>
                        <p>In addition to provisions of the character indicated above, the trade
                            agreement might provide for unconditional and unrestricted most favored
                            nation treatment, subject to the usual exception regarding preferences
                            by the United States to the commerce of Cuba, and to other generally
                            recognized exceptions; provision against quantitative restrictions
                            (quotas) on imports of products respecting which tariff concessions are
                            granted by each party under the agreement; provision against increased
                            internal taxes on such products; and national treatment with respect to
                            internal taxes on all products.</p>
                        <p>The Minister of the United States at Managua is being instructed in the
                            above sense and is being requested to proceed with exploratory
                            conversations along the lines indicated if the Government of Nicaragua
                            is so disposed.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that on receipt
                            of the Department’s mail instruction No. 11 of January 4, 1934 (File No.
                            611.1731/40 [<hi rend="italic">46</hi>]) I called on the then Acting
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Franklin Springer, on January 12, and
                            enquired whether he had yet received from the Nicaraguan Chargé
                            d’Affaires in Washington a copy of the Department’s memorandum of
                            January 4, regarding the possibility of concluding a reciprocal trade
                            agreement between the United States and Nicaragua. On being informed by
                            Mr. Springer that he had not as yet received a copy, I made such a copy
                            available to him. An appointment was then made for me to discuss the
                            question with Mr. Springer on January 18, he having previously told me
                            that President Sacasa desired him to initiate the conversations with me
                            immediately.</p>
                        <p>When I called, however, on Mr. Springer on January 18, he said that in
                            view of the forthcoming early return of the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, Doctor Léonardo Argüello, he (Mr. Springer) preferred not to
                            initiate conversations on his own part prior to the return of his
                            immediate superior. He stated, however, that he would consult with the
                            Minister of Hacienda at once and have all the available material ready
                            for the consideration of Doctor Argüello, on the latter’s return from
                            Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Argüello, having returned to Managua yesterday afternoon, received
                            me this morning by appointment. I had informed him, when I met him at
                            Corinto on January 22, on the occasion of the departure of my family for
                            the United States, that I should like to converse with him as soon as
                            possible on the above-mentioned subject. When I called on him today, he
                            said that no report had yet been received from the Chargé d’Affaires in
                            Washington and that he had not yet had time to study the matter
                            carefully since his arrival in Managua. He <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499"
                                facs="0565"/>promised me that he would give the matter his careful
                            attention and would communicate with me as soon as he was in a position
                            to discuss the situation.</p>
                        <p>I am, therefore, not able to state whether the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs is prepared to proceed with the suggested conversations “along
                            the general lines indicated in the memorandum.”</p>
                        <p>It would be helpful to me, in such conversations as may later
                            materialize, to have memoranda, exchanges of notes or other documents
                            which were presumably prepared in connection with negotiations which the
                            Department, so I understand, recently undertook with Colombia and other
                            countries so that I might have an understanding of the Department’s
                            general point of view. It would be of help, furthermore, if the
                            Department would inform me specifically what is meant, on page three of
                            the memorandum addressed to the Nicaraguan Chargé d’Affaires, by “other
                            generally recognized exceptions” and “national treatment with respect to
                            internal taxes on all products.”</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful to the Department, therefore, if it would send me at
                            its convenience an amplifying instruction so that I may be in a position
                            correctly to interpret its attitude to the Nicaraguan Government.</p>

                            of January 24, 1934, regarding the proposed reciprocal trade agreement
                            between the United States and Nicaragua. In accordance with your request
                            there are enclosed for your confidential information copies of the
                            English and Spanish texts of the agreement signed December 15, 1933, by
                            the United States and Colombia.<note n="8" xml:id="d490fn8"><ref

                                    249</ref>.</note> In accordance with Article XI the agreement
                            will not become effective until after the enactment of legislation in
                            both countries to give it effect. Such legislation has not yet been
                            enacted in either country.</p>
                        <p>The following analysis of the provisions of the agreement may be of
                            assistance to you in connection with your discussions with the
                            Nicaraguan authorities.</p>
                        <p>The principal provisions of the agreement are found in Articles I and II
                            under which customs concessions or commitments are made by each party
                            with respect to specified products of the other. The last <pb n="500"
                                xml:id="pg_500" facs="0566"/>sentence of the first paragraph of
                            Article I was included in order to conform to the definition of customs
                            duties laid down in the Colombian law, and the limited scope of this
                            definition necessitated the addition of the second paragraph of the
                            article in order to include all other duties, charges and taxes imposed
                            on importations. The text of Article I is therefore peculiar to the
                            agreement with Colombia. The first sentence with the insertion of the
                            words “and import charges” after the words “customs duties” will
                            probably suffice in the case of most countries.</p>
                        <p>Article III contains certain reservations and exceptions. The first of
                            these reservations relates to the right to impose special duties on
                            articles not properly marked to indicate the country of origin and is
                            included in order to give effect to section 304 of the United States
                            Tariff Act of 1930.<note n="9" xml:id="d490fn9">46 Stat. 590.</note> The
                            second reservation relates to anti dumping duties and has been included
                            in consequence of the Anti Dumping Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 11). This
                            reservation, however, is subject to a proviso whereby the Anti Dumping
                            Act will not be applicable to unroasted coffee originating in Colombia.
                            The proviso was included on the insistence of the Colombian negotiators
                            and was not desired by the United States. Since the proviso has been
                            included in the agreement with Colombia a similar proviso could, if
                            necessary, be included in the proposed agreement with Nicaragua. But
                            this Government would be unwilling to extend such a proviso to include
                            any product other than unroasted coffee.</p>
                        <p>The articles on which commitments are made by the United States in the
                            agreement with Colombia are all on the free list, the obligation of the
                            United States being to refrain from subjecting them to duty. As to such
                            articles the above-mentioned reservations suffice. If any dutiable
                            articles should be dealt with in such an agreement certain additional
                            reservations might be necessary, such as a reservation permitting the
                            imposition of countervailing duties on bounty-fed articles (section 303,
                            Tariff Act of 1930).</p>
                        <p>Article IV deals principally with internal excise or consumption taxes as
                            distinguished from charges imposed at the time of importation. These
                            provisions are designed generally to prevent the nullification or
                            impairment of the customs advantages obtained under the agreement
                            through the imposition or the increase of taxes on goods after clearance
                            through the customs. The principal elements which should be kept in mind
                            in considering the provisions of this article are as follows:</p>
                        <p>The kinds of internal taxes dealt with are (1) national or federal taxes,
                            and (2) state, departmental or municipal taxes. The products affected
                            are in two categories, namely, (1) those on which customs concessions
                                <pb n="501" xml:id="pg_501" facs="0567"/>or commitments are made as
                            listed in the schedules appended to the agreement, and (2) these and all
                            other articles. The kinds of treatment stipulated are (1) national
                            treatment, whereby each party agrees to treat imported products the same
                            as like products of domestic production without, however, assuming any
                            obligation as to the absolute amount of the taxes imposed, and (2) a
                            limitation on the absolute amount of the taxes imposed.</p>
                        <p>The first paragraph of the article relates to all articles and provides
                            for national treatment with respect to national or federal taxes.
                            Provisions for general national treatment have been customarily included
                            in treaties entered into by this and other Governments. A general
                            purpose of such a provision is to confine any discrimination against
                            foreign as compared with domestic goods to the customs houses and thus
                            to simplify the foreign exporters’ problem of determining the
                            competitive disadvantage to which imported goods are subject in the
                            importing country as compared with articles produced therein. This
                            provision serves also to prevent the impairment or nullification by
                            means of discriminatory taxes of the improved competitive position of
                            imported goods established under other provisions of the agreement. It
                            tends to result in more moderate taxes on foreign goods than might
                            otherwise be imposed since due regard must be had for the interests of
                            any domestic producers concerned. It is provisions of this type to which
                            reference was made in the memorandum handed to the Chargé d’Affaires of
                            Nicaragua and regarding which you have inquired in your despatch under
                            reference.</p>
                        <p>The second paragraph of the article also provides for national treatment,
                            but relates only to certain products included in the schedules instead
                            of being generally applicable to all products; and to state,
                            departmental or municipal taxes as distinguished from national or
                            federal taxes. The provisions of this paragraph reflect certain
                            peculiarities of the tax system of Colombia. The United States desired a
                            general provision for national treatment in respect of all taxes,
                            national, federal, state, departmental, or municipal, on all articles,
                            but was unable to obtain acceptance of such a provision by Colombia. The
                            provisions of the second paragraph of the article represent a compromise
                            whereby national treatment with respect to departmental or municipal
                            taxes in Colombia is limited to certain products in the appended
                            schedule.</p>
                        <p>The third paragraph provides for a limitation on the absolute amount of
                            all national, federal, departmental, state or municipal taxes on
                            articles with respect to which the parties have respectively made
                            customs concessions or commitments under the agreement, subject to the
                            proviso that with respect to state, departmental, or municipal taxes any
                            state, department or municipality of either country may <pb n="502"
                                xml:id="pg_502" facs="0568"/>increase its taxes to an amount equal
                            to those imposed on the day of the signature of the agreement by any
                            other state, department, or municipality in that country. The purpose of
                            the limitation on the absolute amount of internal taxes on products in
                            the schedules is to ensure that the customs concessions on these
                            products will not be nullified or impaired. This provision is
                            particularly important in relation to products not produced in
                            substantial quantities in the importing country and with respect to
                            which a provision for national treatment is of little practical value.
                            Thus, as regards products of particular importance to each party as
                            indicated by their inclusion in the schedules of products on which
                            customs concessions or commitments are obtained, a double safeguard of
                            national treatment and of a limitation on the absolute amount of
                            internal taxes is provided.</p>
                        <p>The fourth paragraph of the article is designed to make it clear that the
                            obligations assumed by the United States under the second and third
                            paragraphs apply to state taxes only in so far as they are subject to
                            statutory control by the Federal Government. The provisions referred to
                            would not, for example, apply to a tax imposed by a state of the United
                            States which was held by the courts to be a tax on intra-state commerce
                            and hence not subject to statutory control by the Federal
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The fifth paragraph relates to discriminatory transportation rates and is
                            a special provision occasioned by certain discriminations to which
                            American trade has been subject in Colombia.</p>
                        <p>Article V is designed to ensure that tariff concessions will not be
                            nullified or impaired by means of prohibitions or restrictions. The
                            article relates only to products on which customs concessions or
                            commitments are made under the agreement. The provision against the
                            imposition of prohibitions and restrictions does not apply under certain
                            circumstances and conditions which are specified in the article and
                            which will probably be found self-explanatory. As regards products not
                            included in the schedules provision is made in Article VII for most
                            favored nation treatment with respect to prohibitions and
                            restrictions.</p>
                        <p>Article VI provides for notice of changes in administrative rules
                            effecting advances in duties and charges applicable to imports. The
                            purpose of this provision is to prevent the disruption of plans and
                            arrangements of traders which sudden and unforeseen changes are likely
                            to entail. It will be noted that the provision applies to administrative
                            changes only; not to changes effected by legislation. Legislative
                            changes normally receive sufficient publicity prior to enactment to warn
                            traders of impending changes and to allow them to make their plans
                            accordingly. The exceptions to the rule regarding notice of changes will
                            probably be found self-explanatory. The clause, <pb n="503"
                                xml:id="pg_503" facs="0569"/>“unless otherwise provided under
                            constitutional requirements”, at the beginning of the article was
                            considered to be necessary by the Colombian negotiators to meet certain
                            legal exigencies in that country. Its inclusion is not necessary from
                            the standpoint of the United States. The phrase “or customs courts” is
                            also unnecessary from the standpoint of this Government.</p>
                        <p>Article VII provides for unconditional most favored nation treatment
                            regarding import and export duties, charges, restrictions and
                            formalities. Provision for unconditional most favored nation treatment
                            is desirable in so far as products included in the schedules are
                            concerned since the value of concessions made by one party to the other
                            might, in the absence of the most favored nation clause, be seriously
                            impaired by the subsequent granting of greater concessions to some other
                            country. As regards articles which for one reason or another are not
                            included in the schedules each party will at once obtain, under the
                            provisions of this article, the benefit of any concessions made on such
                            articles by the other party under reciprocity agreements with other
                            countries. The importance of this latter consideration lies in the fact
                            that concessions granted by the United States to each country will apply
                            only to products of major importance to that country. This limitation is
                            necessary because any concessions made to one country will be freely
                            extended at least to countries with which the United States has treaties
                            or agreements providing for most favored nation treatment, and
                            concessions on products of importance to those countries must be
                            reserved for negotiations with them. The inclusion of the unconditional
                            most favored nation clause in the reciprocity agreement assures the
                            parties thereto that in addition to reciprocal concessions on products
                            of major importance to them, they will obtain concessions on other
                            products of less importance as soon as reciprocity agreements affecting
                            these products are concluded with other countries.</p>
                        <p>In carrying out a reciprocity program concessions will normally be made
                            to each country on products of which that country has been the chief
                            source of imports into the United States. Statistical studies show that
                            under such a plan concessions made to each country can be generalized to
                            all others and an ample basis for negotiating with most of the important
                            countries of the world can still be maintained. However, the execution
                            of a reciprocity program while retaining the advantages of a general
                            policy of unconditional most favored nation treatment presents certain
                            aspects more or less peculiar to Nicaragua and some of the other Latin
                            American countries. Certain products, notably coffee and bananas, occupy
                            a predominant place among the exports of a number of these countries. It
                            may be considered advisable, if and when negotiations with Nicaragua
                            shall have been completed, to postpone actually bringing the agreement
                            into force until <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0570"/>negotiations
                            shall have been completed with certain other countries to which coffee
                            or bananas are important export products, in order to preserve a basis
                            for negotiations with such countries. Steps have already been taken to
                            determine the possibility of concluding agreements similar to that with
                            Colombia with several other countries to which coffee or bananas are of
                            predominant importance, namely, Brazil,<note n="10" xml:id="d490fn10"

                        <p>The first four paragraphs of Article VII of the agreement with Colombia
                            follow closely the text of model most favored nation provisions drawn up
                            by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations. The first five
                            paragraphs of the article will probably be found self-explanatory. The
                            other paragraphs perhaps require some comment.</p>
                        <p>The sixth paragraph applies the most favored nation principle to quotas.
                            It is evident that it would be inequitable to divide the total
                            authorized importations of a product equally among the exporting
                            countries. If one country had been supplying 90% of the imports of a
                            product and another 10%, the allotment of equal quotas to the two
                            countries might result in a very drastic curtailment of imports from the
                            first country while permitting and facilitating an actual increase in
                            the imports from the second. The paragraph has in view alloting quotas
                            in accordance with the share of the trade which each of the countries
                            might normally expect to obtain, thus disturbing as little as possible
                            their relative positions. If the total importations of an article in
                            recent years have been 100 and one country has supplied 90% and the
                            other 10% of this amount, and if the total importations from all sources
                            were restricted to 50, the quota for the first country might be 45 and
                            for the second country 5. Under this system the trade of each is reduced
                            in the same proportion. The share of the trade in each product obtained
                            by each exporting country in a period of years preceding the application
                            of the import restriction would be the basis for allotting the
                            permissible imports among the exporting countries concerned. The
                            inclusion of provisions regarding quotas is not, of course, to be taken
                            as implying an intention on the part of this Government to adopt a
                            general quota system.</p>
                        <p>The seventh paragraph contains the exceptions to the most favored nation
                            clause. The “generally recognized exceptions” referred to in the
                            memorandum handed to the Chargé d’Affaires of Nicaragua, regarding which
                            you inquire in your despatch under acknowledgement, include such
                            exceptions as are provided for in this paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The first of these exceptions refers to advantages accorded to adjacent
                            countries to facilitate frontier traffic. This exception, which is <pb
                                n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0571"/>included in the model clause
                            drawn up by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations, would not
                            permit preferences by either party to all importations from adjacent
                            countries. It has in view special circumstances in which localities or
                            cities are divided by the frontier and is designed to permit free
                            intercourse between the parts on each side of the frontier without the
                            necessity of extending such exemptions to the products of the other
                            party to the agreement.</p>
                        <p>A further exception to the most favored nation clause which is commonly
                            recognized in treaties, and which is included in the model clause of the
                            Economic Committee of the League of Nations, relates to advantages to
                            countries which have entered into customs union with one of the parties.
                            Countries which have entered into a customs union are regarded as having
                            been merged into a single entity for customs purposes.</p>
                        <p>Under the exception regarding police and sanitary regulations either
                            party may impose such requirements regarding the entry of merchandise as
                            may be necessary for the enforcement of such regulations. It is evident
                            that governments must retain complete freedom of action in such matters.
                            For example, it is necessary to permit the imposition by either party of
                            a prohibition on the importation of plant or animal products from the
                            territory of the other party in order to guard against diseases
                            prevalent therein, without applying such a measure to importations from
                            other countries where such diseases do not exist.</p>
                        <p>The provisions regarding the commerce of Cuba and regarding the commerce
                            of the dependencies of the United States are exceptions to the most
                            favored nation clause which have been recognized in numerous treaties
                            and agreements concluded by the United States.</p>
                        <p>Under the last paragraph of the article a dependency of the United
                            States, while permitted to grant preferences to the United States or
                            other dependencies thereof, must accord equal treatment to the commerce
                            of the other party as compared with that of foreign countries.</p>
                        <p>Article VIII defines by elimination the area to which the agreement
                            applies, this area being that to which the Tariff Act of 1930 applies.
                            It will be noted that the only provisions of the agreement which apply
                            to the dependencies named in Article VIII are the provisions of Article
                            VII, and that none of the provisions of the agreement applies to the
                            Panama Canal Zone. For the purpose of the Tariff Act and the regulations
                            issued thereunder, the Panama Canal Zone is treated as a foreign
                            country. Exports from the Canal Zone to the United States therefore pay
                            duty in this country as from a foreign country, and articles imported
                            into the Canal Zone from the United States, with certain exceptions such
                            as articles for Government departments, officials and employees, pay the
                            regular duties of Panama.</p>
                        <p>With reference to Article XI it is possible that this Government would
                            desire a different term for future agreements than the two year <pb
                                n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0572"/>term specified in the agreement
                            with Colombia. This matter can be left for decision until after the
                            other provisions of such agreements have been decided upon.</p>
                        <p>As indicated in the Department’s instruction of January 4 a statement of
                            the concessions which this Government would seek from Nicaragua will be
                            prepared as soon as possible. However, owing to the pressure of work
                            arising from similar studies relating to other countries the completion
                            of this statement may be somewhat delayed. Pending the receipt of this
                            statement you are requested to have a study made of the imports into
                            Nicaragua from the United States and the customs treatment to which
                            American trade is subject with a view to submitting your recommendations
                            regarding the concessions which might be requested. In preparing a list
                            of products on which concessions might best be sought you should proceed
                            on the assumption that any concessions granted by Nicaragua to the
                            United States will be extended to other countries in accordance with the
                            unconditional most favored nation principle. As a general rule,
                            therefore, concessions should not be sought by the United States on
                            products of which countries other than the United States are the chief
                            source of imports into Nicaragua and which Nicaragua might conceivably
                            desire to use as a basis for reciprocity negotiations with such
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of the Department’s Instruction No. 55 of April 5, 1934 (no file
                            number), regarding the proposed reciprocal trade agreement between the
                            United States and Nicaragua. Yesterday, I mentioned to the President
                            that I had received no further information from the Nicaraguan
                            Government as to whether it was prepared to enter into conversations
                            with me. The President expressed surprise and said that he had
                            instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs to proceed with negotiations.
                            He requested me to take up the matter with Dr. Argüello.</p>
                        <p>This morning I called on the Minister of Foreign Affairs and told him
                            that I had had a talk with President Sacasa yesterday, that President
                            Sacasa appeared to be in favor of initiating conversations. Dr. Argüello
                            stated that he was studying the matter and suggested that as soon as I
                            should return from my trip to San Salvador, he and I could discuss the
                            matter at length.</p>
                        <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0573"/>
                        <p>It was agreed, therefore, that on my return from my proposed trip,
                            immediate discussions with the Minister of Foreign Affairs will
                            proceed.</p>
                        <p>In my conversation with the President yesterday, he expressed the opinion
                            that Nicaragua is more closely united with the United States than is any
                            other Central American country, and that for this reason the United
                            States should be prepared to afford Nicaragua the most favorable
                            treatment possible. I felt it unwise to comment on this suggestion at
                            that time. The President then continued that the bond between the United
                            States and Nicaragua is the proposed canal envisaged under the
                            Bryan–Chamorro Treaty. Doctor Sacasa then stated that his personal
                            opinion is that the construction of the canal would be the greatest
                            benefit possible to Nicaragua. I inquired whether or not there would be
                            political opposition at this time in Nicaragua to such an achievement.
                            He said that the opposition would be of no consequence; that it is
                            fruitless to worry about opposition here, and that taken in conjunction
                            with the Pan-American Highway project,<note n="12" xml:id="d491fn12">See
                                    <ref target="frus1934v04#pg_467">vol. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                                        >iv</hi>, pp. 467</ref> ff.</note> it would be of great
                            economic and commercial value to this country. Inquiring as to the
                            possible reaction in other Central American countries, the President
                            said that the construction of the canal would be of great benefit to
                            Costa Rica, which would be encompassed by canals (Dr. Argüello, however,
                            upon my repeating to him this conversation this morning, added that El
                            Salvador and Costa Rica would undoubtedly show opposition to the
                            construction of the canal, and added that these two countries were
                            evidencing a united front at the present time).</p>
                        <p>This being the first suggestion since my arrival here that the Government
                            is at present interested in our exercising our rights under the
                            Bryan-Chamorro Treaty, I report the matter to the Department as being of
                            more than ordinary interest.</p>
                        <p>I informed the President and the Minister of Foreign Affairs orally that
                            although I had no instructions at the present time on this matter, I
                            should be glad to have their views in order that I might transmit them
                            to the Department.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatch No. 181 of April
                            24, 1934, regarding the proposed reciprocal trade agreement between the
                            United States <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0574"/>and Nicaragua, I
                            have the honor to state that on May 3, the day following my return from
                            San Salvador, I spoke to President Sacasa enquiring as to the
                            possibility of initiating exploratory conversations. The President
                            stated that he desired these conversations to proceed as soon as
                            possible and that he would speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in
                            this sense. Due to the Cabinet reorganization, as reported in my
                            despatch No. 193 of May 4, 1934,<note n="13" xml:id="d492fn13">Not
                                printed.</note> and because of Doctor Argüello’s having been out of
                            town on a short visit, I did not again broach the matter to the Minister
                            of Foreign Affairs until May 11. At this meeting Doctor Argüello said
                            that he had been studying the correspondence on the subject but had not
                            yet had an opportunity to discuss the matter with Doctor Francisco
                            Castro, the newly appointed Minister of Hacienda. As soon as he had a
                            conversation with him, he promised to get in touch with me. Later that
                            morning I called on all the newly appointed cabinet members in company
                            with the Chief of Protocol, don Lisimaco Lacayo. At my interview with
                            Doctor Castro, at which the Undersecretary of Hacienda, Doctor Luis
                            Quesada was also present, I said that while I made the practice of
                            dealing with the Nicaraguan Government officially through the President
                            and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I should always be glad to discuss
                            informally matters of interest with Doctor Castro, as I had done with
                            his predecessor. I added that I had taken up with the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs that same morning the possibility of our initiating
                            exploratory conversations regarding a reciprocal trade agreement, my
                            understanding being that Doctor Argüello was planning to discuss the
                            matter with Doctor Castro. I said that I would be at Doctor Castro’s
                            disposition in this or any other matter in which he might be
                            interested.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Castro said that he was much interested in a possible reciprocal
                            agreement and that he was studying the matter, but had as yet reached no
                            definitive conclusions.</p>
                        <p>I shall keep this matter actively in the minds of the appropriate
                            officials. From what I have been told by the President and by Doctor
                            Henri De Bayle (when he was here in February of this year) I gather that
                            the chief interest of the Nicaraguan Government is to obtain a market
                            for its sugar and sugar product (rum) in the United States and,
                            specifically, to obtain a quota of from 10,000 to 15,000 long tons per
                            annum. Mr. Ignatius O’Reardon, an American citizen, manager of the
                            Ingenio San Antonio, near Chichigalpa (the largest sugar hacienda in
                            Nicaragua) informs me that a quota of 10,000 tons would cover Nicaraguan
                            needs at the present time. The Department may wish to bear in mind this
                            apparent interest of Nicaragua in a quota on the importation of sugar,
                            to be used for bargaining purposes.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my despatch No. 209 of
                            May 15, 1934, I have the honor to state that the Secretary of Hacienda,
                            Doctor Francisco Castro, recently requested me orally to furnish him
                            with a copy of the reciprocal trade agreement concluded between Colombia
                            and the United States. I informed Doctor Castro that I would not be able
                            to furnish him with such an agreement without the Department’s
                            instructions, and I added that I considered it is contrary to the
                            Department’s policy to furnish foreign governments with copies of
                            conventions between the United States and another foreign power prior to
                            the removal of the injunctions of secrecy by the Senate.</p>
                        <p>I have, however, furnished Doctor Castro with a copy of the joint
                            statement of December 15 issued by the then Acting Secretary of State

                        <p>41. Department’s instruction No. 11, January 4, 1934. The Department
                            wishes to commence exploratory conversations as soon as possible. It is
                            therefore preparing a study of the trade between the two countries and a
                            list of the concessions which would probably be asked of Nicaragua. This
                            list will be forwarded to you shortly. It is hoped that Nicaragua in
                            turn will be in a position to expedite its own study in order that
                            actual conversations can be initiated in Managua not later than
                            September 1. Please ascertain and report whether this is agreeable to
                            the Government of Nicaragua. It is desired that no publicity be given
                            matters for time being.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to inform the Department
                            that immediately on receipt of the Department’s telegraphic instruction
                            No. 41 of <pb n="510" xml:id="pg_510" facs="0576"/>July 17, 8 p.m., I
                            called on President Sacasa and expressed the hope that the Nicaraguan
                            Government would be able to complete its studies as soon as possible in
                            order that we might be able to commence exploratory conversations in
                            Managua with the least possible delay after the receipt of my further
                            instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <p>The President repeated what he had said to me on previous occasions,—that
                            his Government is deeply interested in the possibility of concluding a
                            reciprocal trade agreement with the United States and that he would give
                            instructions immediately to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of
                            Hacienda to complete their studies in order that the conversations might
                            commence. He suggested, on my enquiring what steps I might take to
                            ensure the expeditious handling of the matter, that I address an
                            informal letter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. A copy of the
                            letter, dated July 18 [<hi rend="italic">19</hi>], to Dr. Argüello is
                            transmitted herewith for the Department’s information.<note n="15"
                                xml:id="d495fn15">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>When I presented the letter this morning to Dr. Argüello (he was unable
                            to see me at his office yesterday) I expressed the hope that he might be
                            able to initiate the conversations with me at the earliest possible
                            date; and that I hoped soon to have further information from the
                            Department which would enable me to proceed with him. Dr. Argüello
                            indicated that he would give the matter careful study but made no
                            further comments.</p>
                        <p>Later in the morning I saw the President and told him of my having called
                            on Dr. Argüello. Dr. Sacasa said that Dr. Argüello had not attended the
                            regular cabinet meeting yesterday and that consequently he had not had
                            an opportunity to talk to him about the matter. He said, however, that
                            he had spoken to the Minister of Hacienda, Dr. Francisco Castro, who
                            indicated, so the President said, that he was disposed to start
                            conversations at any time. I expressed my personal opinion to the
                            President that, if each Government could decide what it desired in the
                            matter of concessions from the other, we should then be in a position to
                            start conversations on a definite basis. The President said that he
                            agreed that this would be desirable.</p>
                        <p>I shall continue to endeavor to keep this matter prominently in the minds
                            of the appropriate officials of the Nicaraguan Government; on the other
                            hand, I should appreciate it if the Department would send the further
                            instructions, promised in the Department’s telegram No. 41 as early as
                            convenient, and by airmail.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatches Nos. 348 and
                            350 of July 20 and 21, respectively, regarding the Department’s desire
                            to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement with Nicaragua, I assume that
                            the provision in Paragraph III of Title III of the amended Tariff Act
                            (H. R. 8687)<note n="17" xml:id="d497fn1">Approved June 12, 1934; 48
                                Stat. 943.</note> providing that articles may not be transferred
                            from the dutiable to the free list, or vice versa, would preclude the
                            imposition of duty on coffee and bananas by executive action. If my
                            assumption is correct, it would seem that the implied suggestion
                            contained in the Department’s memorandum of January 4, 1934, to the
                            Nicaraguan Chargé d’Affaires ad interim in Washington (Department’s
                            instruction No. 11 of June [<hi rend="italic">January</hi>] 4, 1934,
                            file 611.1731/40 [<hi rend="italic">46</hi>]) namely: that we might
                            impose a duty upon bananas and coffee imported into Nicaragua, unless
                            Nicaragua should give us such tariff concessions on articles imported
                            into Nicaragua as we might desire, can no longer be made with the same
                            force. I trust that the Department, in accordance <pb n="512"
                                xml:id="pg_512" facs="0578"/>with the views which I express in this
                            despatch, will not employ the procedure suggested in its memorandum of
                            January 4, otherwise I fear that certain difficulties for us may be
                            created.</p>
                        <p>Even though a discussion on the matter may now, because of the amended
                            act, be purely academic, I desire to analyze briefly the situation which
                            might be created should we use as a bargaining weapon the threat of
                            transferring articles, which are now admitted duty free, to the dutiable
                            list; furthermore the background of the existing political and financial
                            situation should be in the minds of those officers of the Department who
                            are to deal with the negotiations of reciprocal trade agreement with
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>Parenthetically, let us first consider the probable effect of putting
                            coffee and bananas on the dutiable list, or intimating that we may do
                            so, unless we should secure the concessions desired from Nicaragua. I
                            quote the figures for the years of 1932 and 1933 regarding the
                            exportation of coffee and bananas, as taken from the report of the
                            Collector General of Customs for those years.</p>

                        <p>It will be noted from the above figures that in 1932, 6% of the total
                            coffee exportations went to the United States, and that in 1933 there
                            was an increase to approximately 12%. Should we have threatened to
                            impose a duty on coffee, it is not improbable that this commodity would
                            have found ready markets in countries other than the United States.
                            Furthermore, the amounts involved do not seem sufficient to convince
                            Nicaragua that the United States as a coffee market is essential to
                            Nicaraguan prosperity. I doubt, therefore, whether a threat to take
                            coffee off the free list would have been effective.</p>

                        <p>It will be noted that in 1932 the United States consumed all the banana
                            crop exported from Nicaragua and that in 1933 we consumed almost the
                            entire exported crop. According to the best information available, all
                            of the companies distributing and/or exporting in Nicaragua are American
                            owned; consequently an imposition of duty on this product should
                            primarily affect adversely the American interests concerned. Loss of
                            revenue would, however, obtain with respect to the Nicaraguan
                            Government, in case of lessened exportation, by virtue of the export tax
                            imposed on bananas, at the rate of ½ to 2 centavos per bunch according
                            to the size (hand count). The total Nicaraguan Government revenue from
                            the exportation of bananas was in 1932 C$ 52,107.29; in 1933 C$
                            54,357.91, (including tax on bananas exported to the Netherlands).</p>
                        <p>Any attempt or threat on our part to transfer bananas or coffee to the
                            dutiable list or to raise the duty, or threaten to do so in the case of
                            other commodities, would, I feel reasonably certain, be bitterly
                            resented here, where the feeling against the United States is still
                            hostile as a result of the intervention. Any threat or action such as
                            indicated would almost certainly be interpreted here as another instance
                            of our using our superior economic strength to dominate small countries,
                            Nicaragua specifically.</p>
                        <p>We have endeavored in every proper way to counteract this sentiment and I
                            believe, as a result of the policy of the “Good Neighbor” and of “Hands
                            Off”, much has been accomplished. Nevertheless, the psychology of the
                            Nicaraguan is such that should we now take some action which he
                            considered drastic and adverse to Nicaragua’s interests, the good
                            accomplished would soon be forgotten.</p>
                        <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0580"/>
                        <p>More practically, any action taken which would result in a decrease in
                            the revenue of the Nicaraguan Government, might have very serious
                            repercussions locally, which would have their effect on our prestige
                            here and in other Latin American countries. As I have endeavored to
                            point out in previous despatches, the present financial situation of the
                            Government is highly precarious, due to the inroads which the expenses
                            of the Guardia Nacional have made on the treasury, resulting in the
                            budget of expenditures being exceeded monthly by C$ 60,000 more or less,
                            according to the best information I have been able to obtain. If, as I
                            understand, there remain less than C$ 300,000 to the credit of the
                            Government in the Bank of Nicaragua from the proceeds of the two credits
                            granted totaling $3,000,000 (half granted in 1932 and the remainder in
                            1933), then it seems to be merely a question of time before the
                            Government will be out of funds. (I cannot conceive it possible that any
                            serious banking institution will grant a further loan to this Government
                            for the purpose of having it squandered by the needless expenditures of
                            the Guardia Nacional, which at the present time, according to
                            information furnished me orally by the Minister of Hacienda, consumes
                            65% or more of the budgeted income of the Government, and does not, so
                            the President tells me, submit to the Government, detailed accounts
                            covering the expenditures). When the moment arrives that the Guardia
                            officers and men are unable to draw their pay, a serious moment for the
                            Government and for the country is at hand. Already has this feeling been
                            manifest in the activities of the Military Academy element of the
                            Guardia, as evidenced by the Castillo plot against the Government (see
                            my despatch No. 336 of July 18 and subsequent despatches on this
                                matter<note n="18" xml:id="d497fn2">Not printed.</note>). Should any
                            action of ours result in decreasing the revenue of the country, one may
                            be certain that the anti-American journalists in Nicaragua and others
                            will feature that point. When unfortunate happenings beset this country
                            the finger of blame is invariably pointed at the United States. I cite
                            as instances the fires following the earthquake in Managua in 1931<note

                        <p>The question which I respectfully submit for the Department’s very
                            serious consideration is this: Is it worth while, from the point of
                            view, not only of our foreign relations but also of the possible
                            financial gain to ourselves, to run the risk of increasing the hostile
                            feeling towards us in Nicaragua; of being a party, even though
                            unwittingly, to the financial collapse of the Government here, with all
                            the graver events which might follow in its wake; and thereby of undoing
                            in Latin America <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515" facs="0581"/>generally some
                            of the happy results already accomplished as a result of the policy of
                            the “Good Neighbor”?</p>
                        <p>From past conversations which I have had with Nicaraguan officials I am
                            of the opinion that the most effective bargaining instrument available
                            (and the least liable to offend susceptibilities), is the desire of
                            Nicaragua to obtain a quota for the importation per annum of 10,000 tons
                            of cane sugar or of sugar products, such as rum. While the value of such
                            an exportation would appear not to be excessive in comparison with the
                            total Nicaraguan exports, it would, I believe, tend to satisfy
                            government, congressional and small stockholding interests and would
                            serve to stimulate sugar production here. At present quotations, the
                            value of 10,000 long tons of sugar would be approximately C$ 360,800, f.
                            o. b., Corinto. (I am informed by the Manager of the San Antonio
                            plantation that its warehouse at Chichigalpa is stored full of sugar
                            without any likelihood of disposing of it unless a market therefor
                            becomes available in the United States.)</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall that the Nicaraguan Government has approached
                            us on several occasions with a view to obtaining such a quota (See Note
                            from Nicaraguan Chargé d’Affaires in Washington of September 16, 1933,
                            and my telegram No. 46 of February 10—1 P.M., 1934<note n="21"
                                xml:id="d497fn5">Telegram not printed.</note>). Should we be able to
                            grant the Nicaraguan request, in return for tariff concessions granted
                            to us by Nicaragua, I am inclined to believe that this would be the
                            course most advantageous to our interests, in so far as Nicaragua is
                            concerned.</p>
                        <p>With regard to possible concessions which might be made to the United
                            States, some months ago I made informal enquiries of the Foreign Office
                            as to the most-favored-nation treaties in force to which Nicaragua was a
                            party. According to the reply received, Nicaragua is a party to treaties

                            Minister for Foreign Affairs, Doctor Léonardo Argüello, informed
                            Minister Lane, in the course of a meeting on August 17, 1934, that he
                            had requested the Chamber of Commerce of Managua to make suggestions as
                            to what concessions Nicaragua might ask of the United States in
                            negotiating a trade agreement between the two countries. Doctor Argüello
                            stated that he had made the request in confidence and that he had
                            consulted only the Managua organization, implying that other Chambers of
                            Commerce in the country were of little importance.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing is the only tangible step of preparation for preliminary
                            discussion of the proposed agreement which has come to the Legation’s
                            notice since President Sacasa informed the Minister one month ago that
                            Doctor Francisco Castro, the Minister of Finance, was disposed to start
                            conversations at any time (the Legation’s despatch No. 348 of July 20,
                            1934).</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received your despatch
                            No. 354 of July 23, 1934, concerning the proposed reciprocal trade
                            agreement between the United States and Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The act approved June 12, 1934, provides that “No proclamation shall be
                            made increasing or decreasing by more than 50 per centum any existing
                            rate of duty or transferring any article between the dutiable and free
                            lists”. The Legation is correct, therefore, in assuming that this act
                            precludes the imposition of duties on coffee and bananas by executive
                            action. However, in the absence of an obligation to Nicaragua to retain
                            products originating in that country on the free list, there is nothing
                            to prevent the Congress from imposing duties upon them if it so desires.
                            The value of a provision continuing specified articles on the free list
                            would be that, during the effective period of the agreement, Nicaragua
                            would be protected against the possible imposition of duties on such
                            articles.</p>
                        <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0583"/>
                        <p>With reference to enclosure No. 1 of your despatch referred to, the
                            reductions in duties which the United States might agree to make in an
                            agreement with Nicaragua would apply equally to all countries, except
                            Cuba, with which the United States has a special treaty relationship
                            under which the percentage of preference accorded to Cuban products must
                            be maintained. The United States would perceive no objection, therefore,
                            if concessions by Nicaragua to the United States should be generalized
                            to other countries in conformity with Nicaragua’s most-favored-nation
                            treaties or its general commercial policy. Such general reductions would
                            be quite consonant with the policy of the United States, which is to
                            seek an increase in the total volume of international trade rather than
                            the diversion of trade from one channel to another.</p>
                        <p>Consideration is being given, also, to the other matters contained in
                            your despatch.</p>

                            of August 1, 1934,<note n="28" xml:id="d501fn1">Not printed.</note> with

                        <p>From the last paragraph of your despatch the Department gathers the
                            impression that the belief is held in Nicaragua that the Costigan-Jones
                            sugar legislation<note n="29" xml:id="d501fn2">Approved May 9, 1934; 48
                                Stat. 670.</note> places quota restrictions on the importation of
                            all types of sugar in continental United States, whether “drawback” or
                            sugar for consumption purposes. In order that you may have the <pb

                            department of this Government regarding this matter, there is enclosed a
                            copy of a note dated July 10, 1934, from the Nicaraguan Legation<note
                                n="31" xml:id="d501fn3">Not printed.</note> inquiring whether
                            “drawback” sugar is subject to any quota restrictions under the
                            Costigan-Jones sugar legislation, together with a copy of the reply from
                            the Department of Agriculture dated August 1, 1934.<note n="31"
                                xml:id="d501fn4">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It will be noted that this latter communication states the opinion that
                            foreign sugars which are imported into continental United States for
                            “drawback” purposes will not be charged against the consumption quotas
                            established by the Secretary of Agriculture for each respective country,
                            but that an authoritative comment has been requested from the General
                            Counsel of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Upon the result
                            of further advice, an instruction will be forwarded the Legation about
                            this matter.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, at
                            President Sacasa’s invitation, I called on him on September 19, 1934, so
                            that, to use his own phrase, he “might talk things over with me”. He
                            told me over a period of more than two hours of his difficulties and
                            troubles.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Turning to the question of the proposed trade agreement between the
                            United States and Nicaragua, President Sacasa expressed gratification at
                            the ruling of the Department of Agriculture that “drawback” sugar would
                            not be subject to quota provisions, of which he had been informed by
                            Doctor Henri de Bayle, the Nicaraguan Chargé d’Affaires in Washington.
                            He said, however, that he still hoped that it would be possible for
                            Nicaragua to secure a sugar quota in connection with the negotiations
                            for the trade agreement. I then remarked that Mr. Ignatius O’Reardon,
                            the manager of the San Antonio sugar estate, the only exporter of
                            refined sugar from Nicaragua at the present time had told me that a
                            quota for Nicaragua would be of little use as, in his opinion,
                            Nicaraguan sugar could not, in any case, compete in the domestic trade
                            of the United States with American continental or insular sugar or that
                            of Cuba because of advantages of the latter in freight rates and/or
                            customs duties.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Sacasa then went on to say that what he hoped for was not only a
                            quota but preferential duty on the same terms as Cuba. I explained to
                            him that, as I understood the matter, Cuba is in a special status,
                            provided for in our existing most-favored-nation treaties, and that I
                            thought that the only way to give Nicaragua equivalent treatment would
                            be to denounce all of our most-favored-nation treaties with sugar
                            producing countries in contravention of our long standing policy on the
                            question. The President did not seem to get the point although I
                            reiterated it. I should be appreciative if the Department would advise
                            me whether my interpretation is correct.</p>

                            September 15, 1934,<note n="33" xml:id="d505fn33">Not printed.</note>
                            from the American Vice Consul at Managua, transmitting a copy of a
                            communication from the Collector General of Customs and High
                            Commissioner to the Nicaraguan Minister of Finance, outlining proposals
                            for a new Nicaraguan Tariff which may be presented to Congress for
                            action at this session. In his transmitting despatch, the Vice Consul
                            states: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“… it is noted that the Proposed Tariff makes provisions for
                                    increased duties on commodities of vital importance in the
                                    United States’ export trade, including such items as wheat
                                    flour, hog lard and substitutes, machinery in general, and
                                    automobiles.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as Nicaragua has expressed its desire to negotiate a commercial
                            agreement with the United States, the general purpose of which it is
                            clearly understood will be to remove or reduce existing barriers to
                            trade, including import tariffs, the Department believes it has a right
                            to expect that the Government of Nicaragua, pending the completion of
                            the negotiations, should refrain from increasing its import duties on
                            products which are principally of American origin. It is desired that
                            you point this out informally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and
                            report the result of your representations.</p>

                        <p>Some days ago, before the date of the Department’s instruction, I
                            mentioned to the Minister for Foreign Affairs my feeling that the
                            enactment of a new tariff increasing rates while negotiations were
                            pending for a trade agreement between the United States and Nicaragua
                            which would presumably be intended to produce the opposite effect would
                            be unfortunate, especially as some of the items which would be affected
                            are imported mainly from the United States. The Minister replied that he
                            did not think there was any possibility of the proposed tariff being
                            enacted at the current session of Congress which is due to terminate on
                            October 5, 1934. Later, I made a similar statement to President Sacasa
                            who told me (1) that he had not yet presented the proposed tariff to
                            Congress because his financial advisers had not had a chance to consider
                            it in detail and correlate it with the Government’s general economic
                            program and (2) that he considered my point well taken.</p>

                            on page five of your despatch No. 496 of September 26, 1934, reporting
                            that President Sacasa in a recent conversation expressed the hope that
                            the United States would grant Nicaragua a sugar quota on the same
                            preferential terms as Cuba. You inquire as to whether your
                            interpretation of the difference in status between Cuba and Nicaragua,
                            as conveyed to President Sacasa, is correct.</p>
                        <p>The Department approves your expression of views on this subject to
                            Doctor Sacasa. The Department does not contemplate departing from its
                            established policy of unconditional most-favored-nation treatment and of
                            making an exception to this rule only in favor of Cuba. In the
                            negotiations for trade agreements shortly to be undertaken, it is not
                            planned to grant preferential treatment to any other countries.
                            Furthermore, under the Trade Agreements Act of June 12, 1934, this
                            Government could discriminate in favor of the product of one country as
                            against the product of another only if the latter discriminated against
                            the trade of the United States or if its acts or policies were such as
                            to defeat the purposes of the act.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that President
                            Sacasa has twice recently spoken to me about his plans for revision of
                            the Nicaraguan tariff. In his conversations he has stressed two points,
                            the need of the Nicaraguan Government for added revenues and the danger
                            that Nicaraguan markets will be flooded by Japanese goods with
                            detrimental results to Nicaraguan export trade.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the first point, the President stated that he had
                            given some study to the proposal of the Collector General of Customs for
                            a revision of the tariff, generally along upward lines (despatch No. 37,
                            of September 15, 1934, from the Consulate at Managua<note n="36"
                                xml:id="d511fn36">Not printed.</note>), but that he did not wish to
                            do anything about the matter until the reciprocal trade agreement
                            negotiations between the United States and Nicaragua had been disposed
                            of.</p>
                        <p>President Sacasa expressed the feeling that large Japanese imports into
                            Nicaragua would be regrettable as Japan took none of Nicaragua’s exports
                            and the general trend in the world today seemed to be to trade on a
                            reciprocal basis. He said that the Exchange Control Commission had tried
                            to hold down Japanese imports by restrictions on the granting of foreign
                            exchange to cover them but that this had been unsuccessful. While the
                            President did not mention it, the reason for this seems to be that,
                            although Japanese exporters require payment on or before delivery, their
                            prices are such that importers can buy foreign exchange from brokers at
                            the prevailing street rate of about 1.20 córdobas to the dollar instead
                            of from the National Bank at the official rate of 1.02 córdobas to the
                            dollar and still purchase goods cheaper than from American, British,
                            German or French exporters.</p>
                        <p>One thing which appeared to worry Doctor Sacasa and certainly does other
                            Nicaraguan officials is that, under the new German exchange regulations,
                            Nicaragua will be able to sell coffee to Germany, its principal market,
                            only to the extent that Nicaragua purchases German exports. The
                            President seemed to have a vague idea that, if imports from Japan could
                            be cut off, some of the trade would go to Germany with reciprocal
                            benefits to Nicaragua. Other officials appear to be more inclined to
                            regard the German market as definitely lost and to be hoping for the
                            development of new coffee markets, such as in the United States.</p>
                        <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0590"/>
                        <p>The President remarked that he was inclined to think that a modification
                            of the Salvadoran preferential tariff scheme<note n="37"

                            (Despatch No. 589, of August 28, 1934, from the Consulate General at San
                                Salvador<note n="38" xml:id="d511fn38">Not printed.</note>) would
                            furnish Nicaragua the greatest measure of protection and do the most
                            good. From all appearances he was convinced of the efficacy of this
                            system by several conversations last month with Mr. E. C. Curtis, a
                            traveling agent for Brune, Pottberg and Co., of New York, with
                            credentials as a representative of the Textile Exporters Association of
                            the United States, which has sent representatives to all of the Central
                            American countries in an endeavor to secure action which would
                            counteract the dumping in them of Japanese cotton goods exports and
                            enable American exports of this category (the most important item in
                            American export trade to Central America) to maintain their position,
                            which has been seriously undermined.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Curtis, a very able and intelligent German Jew who has been a
                            resident of the United States since before the entrance of the United
                            States into the World War and has taken out first papers, in various
                            talks with me expressed his belief that the only way in which the
                            American textile export trade, as well as the British, could continue to
                            meet Japanese competition in Central America was by an extension to
                            other countries of the Salvadoran tariff system. He frankly expressed
                            the opinion that no reductions in tariff rates which could conceivably
                            be secured in reciprocal trade agreements (which would presumably not be
                            extended to Japan since it does not have a most-favored-nation treaty
                            with Nicaragua nor, so far as the Legation has been able to ascertain,
                            with the other Central American countries) would enable American cotton
                            goods exporters to compete with their Japanese competitors on terms of
                            price equality.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Curtis, who is a very efficient propagandist, appears to have
                            strongly influenced Doctor Léonardo Argüello, Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs. In addition, he succeeded in getting some newspaper support for
                            his propaganda and had several articles, written by him, published in
                                <hi rend="italic">La Noticia</hi>, the leading local daily.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after Mr. Curtis’s departure for Honduras, where he intended to
                            pursue a similar campaign, two Japanese officials, Messrs. Kazaburo
                            Kataoka and Yasuto Shudo, one understood to be a member of the Japanese
                            Legation staff in Mexico City and the other a Foreign Office employee,
                            arrived in Managua in the course of a trip through the Central American
                            countries and Panama. They gave several newspaper interviews to the
                            effect that their mission was to improve commercial relations between
                            Japan and Central America and that Japan was anxious to purchase
                            Nicaraguan products, mentioning raw <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525"
                                facs="0591"/>cotton, hard woods, coffee and scrap iron. The
                            Department can judge as to the seriousness of these remarks. Nicaragua
                            exports no cotton, its hard woods could hardly compete with those from
                            Formosa, for example, the Japanese are not known as a race of coffee
                            drinkers and the only scrap iron in Nicaragua consists of old rails and
                            abandoned railroad material, principally on the east coast.</p>
                        <p>The two Japanese officials remained in Managua only two days, from
                            October 15 to 17, 1934, and did not have an interview with the
                            President. They were received by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who
                            told me that he was badly impressed by their manner. He stated that,
                            while they carried proper credentials, they had used journalistic rather
                            than diplomatic methods in questioning him (Doctor Argüello has
                            apparently had little experience with the typical Japanese thirst for
                            knowledge). They made no concrete proposals, according to Doctor
                            Argüello, but indicated that they would send him a note from Panama.
                            When I last saw the Minister, last week, before his departure for Léon,
                            he told me that he had had no word from the Japanese
                            representatives.</p>
                        <p>I think there is little question that the higher Nicaraguan authorities,
                            as a whole, would much prefer to give the United States tariff
                            preference by raising tariff rates on imports from such of our
                            competitors as Japan rather than by lowering duties on our products and
                            those of other nations having most-favored-nation treaties with
                            Nicaragua. The Nicaraguan Government is at its wit’s end to make ends
                            meet and does not want to lose any revenues. The lesson that one of the
                            major causes of the world depression is the system of worldwide tariff
                            barriers damming the stream of natural international commercial
                            intercourse has not been learned by it.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The receipt is acknowledged of your
                            despatch No. 593 of November 12, 1934,<note n="39" xml:id="d512fn39">Not
                                printed.</note> reporting the circulation of a rumor in Nicaragua to
                            the effect that a quota of 9,000 tons of sugar for importation into the
                            United States has been allotted to Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>In reply, there is enclosed a copy of “General Sugar Quota Regulations,
                            Series 1, Supplement 1” of the Department of Agriculture issued on
                            October 9, 1934, which fixes the 1934 quotas for full duty sugar <pb
                                n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0592"/>imported for consumption into
                            the United States. You will note that the quota allotted to Nicaragua is
                            6,985,419.88 pounds, or something over 3,000 long tons.</p>
                        <p>The amounts of the full duty sugar quotas are of public knowledge; but,
                            in view of the somewhat smaller quotas for the Central American
                            Republics than had been hoped for by interested parties, it would not
                            appear either necessary or advisable for the Legation to take any steps
                            to make known to the public the amount of the Nicaraguan quota. In case
                            you receive any direct inquiries in the matter, you are, of course,
                            authorized to supply the requested information.</p>
                        <p>It is suggested that, in case the subject of Nicaraguan sugar quotas is
                            brought up in any conversations you may have with Nicaraguan officials,
                            you point out that sugar imported into the United States for re-export
                            on a “drawback” basis is not subject to the quota and continues to be
                            admitted into the United States in unlimited quantities. It is
                            understood that the bulk of Nicaraguan sugar exported to the United
                            States is of the “drawback” category.</p>

                            January 26 which he had received from Sandino stating in substance as
                            follows: Sandino had heard that the Government had decided not to live
                            up to the provisions of the agreement of February 2, 1933,<note n="41"

                            this report was inexact. Sandino would be loyal to the President should
                            the latter have trouble with the “unconstitutional” Guardia Nacional but
                            will not give up his arms. He went so far as to say that the President
                            would endeavor to use force if disarmament of Sandino’s forces were
                            desired. He referred in hostile terms to the attitude of the
                            Guardia.</p>

                        <p>The President said to me that the threatening tone of Sandino’s letter
                            angered him and that he would not permit such an attitude of lack of
                            respect which had resulted in the creation of a state within a state. He
                            said, however, that the tactless attitude of the Guardia and
                            particularly of General Somoza<note n="42" xml:id="d513fn42">General

                            aggravated the situation and that he is more concerned regarding the
                            attitude of the Guardia than he is with respect to Sandino (my letter of

                            unable to land at Wiwili and that consequently Sandino’s arrival here
                            will be delayed: meanwhile, there appears to be uncertainty on the part
                            of the Government as to what action it will take.</p>
                        <p>General Somoza tells me that he will take no action to embarrass the
                            President and that Guardia will be loyal. Reports from consular agent at
                            Matagalpa, however, indicate that tense feeling exists in that region
                            between Guardia and Sandinistas and that the former are anxious to
                            create a pretext in order to attack latter.</p>

                            reporting the arrival of Sandino in Managua on that date, I have the
                            honor to report that during the last few days very prolonged
                            negotiations have been carried on with Sandino in the Presidential House
                            with a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory formula for dealing
                            with the situation which has arisen with the termination on February 17
                            of the time limit of one year provided for in the peace pact of February
                            2, 1933. As has been previously reported General Somoza and the Guardia
                            Nacional have strongly maintained the view that Sandino should now turn
                            over all his arms and munitions, stating that such action would be in
                            accordance with the terms of the peace pact. President Sacasa himself
                            maintained a more conciliatory attitude, but without announcing publicly
                            just what policy he intended to pursue.</p>
                        <p>In the local press of February 17, 1934, Sandino was reported to have
                            said that he would not turn over his arms to the Guardia Nacional
                            because of the unconstitutionality of that organization; and that he
                            actually assumed this attitude seems to have been confirmed by
                            subsequent press reports and by conversations I have had with officials
                            close to the situation. General Somoza was admittedly resentful of this
                            declaration attributed to Sandino, and has told me several times that he
                            would like to “lock him up.” One result of the raising of this point by
                            Sandino, namely, the alleged unconstitutionality of the Guardia
                            Nacional, may be that the National Congress will finally decide to enact
                            legislation designed to put the organization on a firm and unquestioned
                            legal basis. The need for Congressional action was pointed out by Juan
                            Ramon Aviles in an editorial in <hi rend="italic">La Noticia</hi> of
                            February 18, 1934. Whether or not this would bring before Congress the
                            project of law for the Guardia Nacional submitted by General Matthews in

                            seems now more urgent than ever.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Salvador Calderón Ramirez<note n="50" xml:id="d516fn50">Nicaraguan
                                Chargé in Mexico.</note> has been taking part in the conversations
                            with Sandino in the Presidential House, and has apparently exerted his
                            influence on the side of reasonable conciliation. At the same time, if I
                            may judge from the conversations I have had with him, he is somewhat
                            disillusioned, and has referred in disparaging tones to Sandino’s
                            intellectual capacity for expressing his ideas. A similar opinion was
                            expressed the other day by Doctor Léonardo Argüello, Minister of Foreign
                            Affairs, when he stated that he carefully listened to Sandino talk for
                            half an hour, but was unable afterwards to express any opinion
                            concerning what had been said because he did not know what had been
                            said. High officials in the Government have manifested an impatience
                            because so much time has been and is being spent in long negotiations
                            with such a person. Finally, President Sacasa himself has given evidence
                            of losing his patience and in speaking confidentially to me gave me the
                            impression that he was inclined to take a firm stand and deal strongly
                            with the situation.</p>
                        <p>In an interview which appeared in <hi rend="italic">La Nueva Prensa</hi>
                            of February 20, 1934, Sandino is reported to have said that the United
                            States would like to get him out of the Rio Coco region in order that
                            the land there might fall into American hands and serve as a source of
                            food supply in the event of a war. No indication was given as to what
                            may have prompted him to make such a statement.</p>
                        <p>According to reports received from Mr. John A. Willey, American Consular
                            Agent in Matagalpa, there is considerable uneasiness in the Segovias
                            with respect to Sandino’s future movements. The possibility of a general
                            attack by Sandino and all his followers has been freely discussed, and
                            worry is expressed lest bandit activities interfere with the remaining
                            coffee shipments. The possibility of an attack on Matagalpa for the
                            purpose of looting has even been suggested. Very little, if anything,
                            has so far happened to justify such fears in that area, but there
                            obviously exists a feeling of tense uncertainty.</p>

                        <p>57. My 48, February 14, 5 p.m. Last night, February 21, about 11 o’clock
                            machine gun fire was heard near the Legation residence. <pb n="530"
                                xml:id="pg_530" facs="0596"/>On entering town to investigate we
                            observed that house of Salvatierra, Minister of Agriculture, where
                            Sandino has been staying, had apparently been attacked, a wounded man
                            lying on sidewalk immediately in front and a detachment of about ten
                            Guardia men being stationed across the street. The captain of the
                            detachment informed me that Sandino’s men had fired upon Guardia which
                            had replied in kind. Proceeding to Legation office we telephoned to
                            President who requested me to confer with him.</p>
                        <p>From what he and others in the Presidential quarters told me I understand
                            that Sandino, his father, Salvatierra and General Estrada left the
                            Presidency about 10:30 and on approaching entrance to Campo de Marte car
                            was stopped and taken with occupants to nearby military prison whence
                            Generals Sandino and Estrada were removed. (While President and General
                            Somoza tell me that they are unaware of what happened to Sandino, I have
                            reason to believe that Sandino has been killed.)</p>
                        <p>The President having told me that he was unable to reach Somoza by
                            telephone he asked me whether I would endeavor to persuade him to come
                            to the Presidency. I agreed. I found Somoza in his home apparently
                            unwilling to go because of possibility that violence might be done to
                            him. On my offering to take him with me in my car he consented to
                            accompany me. At the President’s invitation I was present when he
                            interviewed Somoza who professed ignorance of what had happened and said
                            that he had been attending a concert all evening. [Omission?] it having
                            developed then that Salvatierra and Sandino’s father were in jail, and
                            at the request of both the President and Somoza I took them from the
                            jail to the Legation office (Somoza told me that he could not guarantee
                            their lives as far as the Guardia was concerned). From here they
                            telephoned the President who requested that they proceed to the
                            Presidency under the protection of the Legation car. This protection was
                            accorded.</p>
                        <p>I was informed that orders had been issued by General Somoza to the
                            Guardia to concentrate on Wiwili with a view to bringing about the
                            surrender of the arms of Sandinistas and in case this were impossible to
                            exterminate them. Also that Conservative military leaders be imprisoned
                            (Somoza later told the President in my presence that order regarding
                            Conservatives would be countermanded immediately, the President having
                            argued that there was no proof against that Party which would
                            necessitate such action).</p>
                        <p>Yesterday morning I received Somoza who had telephoned that he wished to
                            see me urgently on an important matter. He informs me that President had
                            exchanged letters with Sandino implying that Guardia should be
                            reorganized within 6 months; also that General Portocarrero, former
                            Sandinista candidate for President, had been <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531"
                                facs="0597"/>chosen as delegate of Government in Provinces of
                            Esteli, Nueva Segovia, Jinotega, and Matagalpa. Somoza, who appeared
                            unusually excited, stated that Portocarrero’s appointment was an insult
                            to the Guardia as it would put the Guardia under the control of Sandino.
                            I advised him to be calm and suggested that I confer with Calderón
                            Ramirez to ascertain the real situation. (Somoza told me that he wanted
                            to proceed immediately against Sandino and that if I would merely wink
                            my eye he would “lock him up”. Again I advised caution and suggested to
                            him the possible consequences of any violent action such as civil
                            war.)</p>
                        <p>Yesterday afternoon I saw Calderón who said that Portocarrero although
                            once a Sandino enthusiast was now very loyal to the Government and was,
                            in his opinion, the best selection for the position of delegate. I
                            repeated this message to Somoza at 6 o’clock and was told by him that he
                            would not “start anything” without prior consultation with me. Somoza
                            appeared even more nervous than in the morning and was conferring with
                            three Guardia officers (one of whom I recognized outside of
                            Salvatierra’s house afterwards) when I entered his home. He said that,
                            while he accepted Calderón’s estimation of Portocarrero, the Guardia
                            would be furious at the “insult” and that things had reached a point
                            where he could no longer control the Guardia. As I left him he again
                            said that nothing would be done without consulting first with me.</p>
                        <p>The President told me that the action of the Guardia is nothing short of
                            revolt and that he is uncertain whether he can depend on Guardia
                            support.</p>
                        <p>Tense feeling is evident in Presidential circles. Furthermore, from being
                            present at interviews last night between Sacasa and Somoza I gather that
                            former has little control over the latter. On the other hand I am told
                            by one of his relatives [omission?] has sacrificed respect of his men
                            for popularity and that therefore discipline is at a low ebb.</p>
                        <p>Apparent lack of discipline and organization in Guardia and probable
                            reprisals on the part of Sandino’s followers render the situation
                            serious. Apparent general lack of confidence in Government is not a
                            healthy sign.</p>

                            asked me to accompany General Portocarrero to aviation <pb n="532"

                            Calderón Ramirez left on the same airplane for San Salvador.</p>
                        <p>President showed me decode of telegram from Jefe Politico at Jinotega
                            indicating that crowd of Government (as distinguished from Guardia)
                            sympathizers had gathered to offer loyalty to President. President
                            stated that similar telegrams had been received from all parts of the
                            country.</p>
                        <p>He said he had placed censorship on all outgoing communications and that

                        <p>Later I saw General Somoza. He told me that General Sandino, his brother
                            Socrates, and Generals Estrada and Umanzor had been killed last evening
                            and that son-in-law of Salvatierra had been badly wounded in the
                            fighting outside of latter’s house.</p>
                        <p>Somoza said that his code message regarding operations at Wiwili, as
                            reported in my telegram 57, February 22, 5 a.m., had been stopped by
                            order of the President but that later it had been released,
                            necessitating a delay, however, of about 8 hours; and that the telegram
                            with respect to the release of Conservatives had been sent.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that the relations between the President and his
                            associates, on the one hand, and Somoza, on the other, are severely
                            strained as a result of the murder of Sandino and his companions. As
                            this relationship is openly discussed here, Somoza told me he would
                            issue statement to the press emphasizing his loyalty to the President.
                            Somoza assures me that he will support President and his government.
                            Since events of last night, however, I have less confidence in his
                            assurances than formerly.</p>
                        <p>Managua is quiet outwardly. Have as yet no reports from other parts of
                            country but have instructed Consul at Puerto Cabezas to telegraph such
                            reaction in his district as he may be able to confirm.</p>

                        <p>61. With reference to my telephone conversation with Edward [<hi
                                rend="italic">Edwin?</hi>] Wilson this morning regarding possibility
                            of Department issuing statement respecting policy of nonrecognition of
                            revolutionary governments, I told Somoza today (for the purpose of
                            sounding him out) that I might consider it wise to make such a
                            declaration. He strongly objected to such a statement on the ground that
                            the public would feel that it involved the Guardia. This naive admission
                            of the connection between the Guardia and a possible unconstitutional
                            government is I think an added reason for such a statement to be made.
                            If the Department decides to make a statement I trust I may have
                            complete text with authority to furnish to local press.</p>
                        <p>Vice President Espinosa called on me this afternoon and said that he
                            believed his life in danger as in the event of retirement of President
                            Sacasa he (Espinosa) would be the chief obstacle to Somoza’s ambitions
                            being realized.</p>

                        <p>64. Last night I was present at a conference between the President and
                            General Somoza at which it was agreed (1) that Somoza should conduct
                            thorough investigation as to parties responsible for killing of Sandino
                            and make prompt report to the President, and (2) that cordial
                            cooperation must exist between the President and the General. There was
                            extended discussion on both of these points but at the close of the
                            conference I felt that relations between them had been considerably
                            improved.</p>
                        <p>This morning Somoza stated to me: <list>

                                <item>He had last night called in the three officers who had
                                    assisted in carrying out the plan for the capture and killing of
                                    Sandino and had told them that the President insisted that the
                                    guilty party or parties be punished and that while he realized
                                    that the whole Guardia is responsible, somebody must assume the
                                    guilt. Each of the three officers offered [to] admit guilt but
                                    it was finally decided that one of them who has but one arm and
                                    whom I had recognized outside of the Salvatierra house
                                    immediately after the shooting there, should bear the brunt
                                    (first, because it was realized that I had recognized him, and
                                    second because it was hoped that the public would not be out of
                                    sympathy with a light punishment to a crippled officer).</item>

                        <p>This afternoon I saw the President in company with Federico Sacasa. The
                            latter read to me Somoza’s proposed statement and indicated that it had
                            his approval. It is to the effect that Somoza will cause a minute
                            investigation to be made, that the incident is deplorable and that the
                            President is in no way implicated. The President did not indicate his
                            views. I understand from Universal Press correspondent, however, that
                            Somoza released text to press this evening (it will not be published
                            here until tomorrow evening as newspapers will not <pb n="535"
                                xml:id="pg_535" facs="0601"/>appear tonight). I transmitted to the
                            President Somoza’s suggestion regarding Crisanto Sacasa. Federico Sacasa
                            said that this would be an excellent move and would create a good
                            impression on the public. The President’s brother said that the best
                            means of Somoza proving his loyalty would be by deeds and suggested that
                            Somoza turn over copies of his codes to the President (at present the
                            President said his office is unable to decipher telegrams received for
                            the Guardia).</p>
                        <p>On leaving the President I conferred with Somoza and suggested as proof
                            of his loyalty that he enable the President to have recourse to all
                            messages. Somoza then offered to give copies of his codes to the
                            President. He likewise said that if the President distrusted him he
                            would resign immediately together with all of his officers and men. (He
                            admitted that the President would be justified in distrusting him as a
                            result of action taken.)</p>

                        <p>65. Department’s telegram 14, February 23, 11 a.m. I have several times
                            explained to General Somoza my understanding of Department’s policy.</p>
                        <p>As explained to Wilson over telephone today the situation has been
                            aggravated since yesterday by the apparently growing and strong feeling
                            that I conspired with Moncada and Somoza to have Sandino killed. This
                            has been told me by Nicaraguan, American and diplomatic sources. This
                            impression may have been emphasized by an article [in] <hi rend="italic"
                                >La Noticia</hi> of February 20 headed “The Sandino Affair” with the
                            subheading “Activities of General Somoza,” stating that I had dined with
                            Somoza Saturday night (which is untrue) and attended a baseball game
                            with him on Sunday.</p>
                        <p>It is true that I had seen Somoza many times prior to Wednesday night
                            with a view to persuading him not to do anything rash. He gave me his
                            word of honor on four separate occasions (the last at 6 p.m. on February
                            21) that he would take no action against Sandino without my consent. He
                            has since apologized to me for what he claims he could not prevent, the
                            feeling among the Guardia officers being too strong against Sandino.
                            Somoza has admitted to me, however, that the officers who participated
                            acted under orders. A statement from the Department at this time in
                            support of the broadly [omission?] or indicating our policy of
                            nonrecognition of non-constitutional governments should serve not only
                            to quiet the anti-American <pb n="536" xml:id="pg_536" facs="0602"
                            />feeling but also to check any military movement against the
                            Government. Beside the President and his brother the following
                            representative Nicaraguans told me today that they still consider the
                            situation very serious: Chief Justice Cuadra Zavala, Vice President
                            Espinosa and Senator Stadthagen. I concur. Although there are
                            suggestions that the President or Somoza should resign, such action
                            would not seem to solve the situation as the problem of relations
                            between the Guardia and constitutional government would still exist. In
                            the absence of a more radical solution it would seem that cordial and
                            harmonious cooperation between the President and Somoza is essential and
                            that Somoza must subordinate himself to the President. I am doing what I
                            can to bring this about.</p>

                        <p>67. Referring to my conversation today with Wilson. I respectfully submit
                            two points for the Department’s consideration: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>I understand from Wilson that our policy regarding
                                    nonrecognition of revolutionary governments has not changed. If
                                    this be the case I fail to see why only Somoza and the
                                    Nicaraguan Government may be told that fact, but that the people
                                    here who think that our silence indicates a reversal of policy
                                    should remain in ignorance with the possible effects which I
                                    have already brought to the Department’s attention.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>

                        <p>Whether or not a period of anarchy or civil war follows in wake of the
                            present situation, it is undeniably true that Nicaragua at present faces
                            a grave crisis, not only in my opinion but in that of every responsible
                            person to whom I have talked. Since it is impossible to predict with
                            certainty that quiet and normal conditions will be restored in the near
                            future, any appropriate step which might be taken in an effort to avoid
                            possible disorders and bloodshed would appear to be justified.</p>

                        <p>69. 1. President Sacasa today with a view to exerting his authority gave
                            written orders to General Somoza on two matters (<hi rend="italic"
                                >a</hi>) regarding delivery of 15 rifles to Mboya and (<hi
                                rend="italic">b</hi>) providing for validity of passports, now
                            required for purchasing railroad tickets, without the visa of the
                            Guardia. General Somoza tonight showed me his replies to these orders
                            complying explicitly in each case. In my estimation his subordination is
                            the most encouraging development in the past few days.</p>
                        <p>2. This morning following a conversation with Senator Stadthagen, a
                            leading Conservative, I informed the President that Stadthagen expressed
                            the personal opinion that the representative Conservatives would be
                            willing to cooperate with the Government provided the President
                            requested their presence. The President declined to make a definite
                            request except on the condition that it be made through me and on the
                            understanding that it was due to a suggestion on my part. General
                            Chamorro sent word this evening to me through Stadthagen that he would
                            not care to go to the Presidency on these terms and only unless the
                            President would state concretely his proposal; otherwise the
                            Conservatives might compromise themselves with the Government which they
                            frankly fear. The President to whom I conveyed the Conservative reply
                            indicated that he would not issue a request under such conditions.</p>
                        <p>3. Somoza told me tonight that Chamorro had sent word to him he would
                            support Guardia and that he had replied thanking him but indicating he
                            did not require support at this time. Somoza said that he conveyed this
                            information immediately to President. The local press appeared tonight
                            for the first time since the night of the 21st and contained the
                            following [(1)] declaration by General Somoza pledging the obedience of
                            Guardia to President Sacasa and (2) a statement by President Sacasa
                            condemning the crime and expressing his confidence in the support of his
                            subordinates and the cooperation of his fellow citizens.</p>

                        <p>70. My 69, February 24, 1 a.m. This morning General Somoza, his staff and
                            other Guardia officers, about 45 in all, called on the President <pb
                                n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0604"/>and reiterated their oath of
                            allegiance. Somoza tells me he made a speech emphasizing the loyalty of
                            the Guardia, pointing out that since the death of Sandino, Sacasa is the
                            real President of Nicaragua, he now having completed jurisdiction over
                            every part of the country, and pledging the support of himself, his
                            officers and men to the “Constitutional Government” of President Sacasa.
                            Somoza said that the President gave him an “abrazo” as the latter
                            departed.</p>
                        <p>Somoza stated to me today that operations were to have begun this morning
                            against the Sandinistas at Wiwili. He said (when I left him at 2:30)

                        <p>71. Earle W. Kingsley, American citizen, employed as pilot of local
                            Italian-owned Aviation Company, called on me today and stated that
                            Guardia Nacional desired to charter plane to drop bombs tomorrow on
                            Sandinistas and inquired whether his participation in such action would
                            jeopardize his citizenship. I replied that according to the precedents
                            of international law available to me his citizenship would not be
                            jeopardized.</p>
                        <p>Emphasizing that I was speaking merely for myself I earnestly requested
                            him as a personal favor not to be a party in any way to bomb-throwing.
                            He said he would refuse to go.</p>
                        <p>If Kingsley should participate in bomb-throwing after having visited me,
                            his action would probably be interpreted as having my approval. This
                            would be most unfortunate, particularly during the present state of
                            public opinion.</p>

                        <p>15. Your 67, February 24, 6 p.m. As Wilson explained to you, there are
                            other issues involved. The Central American countries are planning to
                            hold a conference soon<note n="53" xml:id="d529fn53">For correspondence
                                concerning the Central American Conference held March 15 to April
                                12, 1934, see <ref target="frus1934v04#pg_423">vol. <hi
                                        rend="smallcaps">iv</hi>, pp. 423</ref> ff.</note> at which
                            they will discuss whether <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0605"/>to
                            continue the principle of non-recognition. Costa Rica and El Salvador
                            are apparently doubtful as to the advisability of continuing this
                            principle. If the United States were now to make a public declaration of
                            its support of the principle this would inevitably be interpreted—or
                            misinterpreted—as an effort to influence the deliberations of the
                            conference. As you know, the United States is maintaining a hands off
                            policy regarding the conference and considers that the Central American
                            states in holding this conference should deal with such matters as they
                            desire to discuss entirely on their own responsibility. Furthermore, it
                            has for many years been said that the United States has sought to impose
                            its own views upon the Central American states, and that to this end it
                            has not hesitated to interfere or intervene in their affairs. This
                            criticism has been made particularly in regard to our relations with
                            Nicaragua. We therefore desire not only to refrain in fact from any
                            interference, but also from any measure which might seem to give the
                            appearance of such interference.</p>
                        <p>Your suggestion of a public statement is made, as we understand it, with
                            two objectives in mind: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) to avoid disorders,
                            and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to scotch the malicious rumors that the
                            United States is in some way implicated in the Sandino affair and favors
                            Somoza for the presidency. As regards (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) you
                            have already been authorized to tell Somoza (concerning whose loyalty
                            there was apparently at first some apprehension) that our policy has not
                            been modified. If this statement on your part is ineffective it is
                            difficult to see that a public statement would have much more force in
                            dissuading him from a movement against the Government. (The information
                            contained in your 69 and 70 indicate encouraging developments in this
                            regard.) As concerns (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the ignorant and
                            irresponsible individuals who circulate such rumors would, in our
                            judgment, not only fail to understand the significance of a public
                            statement on our part, but might conceivably misinterpret or twist its
                            meaning in such a way as to cause further embarrassment.</p>
                        <p>We are fully alive to the reasons which have prompted your recommendation
                            and have carefully considered them, but hope that you will appreciate
                            our point of view as set out above.</p>

                        <p>76. The President told me last night that despite the protest of
                            allegiance on the part of the Guardia, as reported in my telegram 70,
                            February 25, 4 p.m., he did not have sufficient confidence in Somoza and
                            his men to refrain from the steps which are now being taken to transform
                            the Casa Presidencial into what is nothing less than an armed camp:
                            trenches having been dug on the crest of the hill, sand bags and machine
                            guns are in evidence, and at night even the reception rooms of the
                            Palace are guarded by armed forces, none of whom are regularly of the
                            Guardia. The President told me that many of the armed men who were from
                            the streets of Managua wished to show their loyalty by offering to
                            defend him. Sacasa said that he could not well refuse their request as
                            they would be offended. What the President does not apparently realize
                            is that it is of vital importance for him not to continue to irritate
                            the Guardia with preparations for defense against them. Responsible
                            people of Managua with whom I have talked have read the statements of
                            Sacasa and Somoza, the oaths of allegiance of the Guardia, the order to
                            the Guardia today, and are at a loss to reconcile them with the
                            maintenance of an arsenal in the President’s house against the very
                            organization which has been set up to defend him.</p>
                        <p>I have decided it is the indecisive character of the President which
                            makes it difficult if not impossible for him to proceed in a strong and
                            courageous manner. Unfortunately he is surrounded by influences which I
                            fear are not for the good of the country: persons who wish to humiliate
                            Somoza regardless of the consequences. The President did admit to me
                            however that an excellent effect should be created by Somoza’s order of
                            today but on the other hand he does not act as though he were willing to
                            do his part in endeavoring to restore harmonious relations. The
                            situation as to Somoza seems to have improved. He has assured me of his
                            loyalty to the President but whether he is strong enough to withstand
                            Moncada’s influence I am not confident. (Somoza told me last night that
                            Moncada had come to Managua on February 21 for the purpose of bringing
                            the Sandino matter <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0607"/>to a head
                            and that he called on me that day with a view to showing the public that
                            the action had the support of the United States. The fact that he
                            lunched with me, although others were present, may have enhanced the
                            impression which it is alleged he wished to create.)</p>

                            that our policy of nonrecognition of revolutionary governments had not
                            been changed, that this fact should be made known, as it is felt by many
                            here that we are supporting the Guardia which is our creation. Cordero
                            Reyes, formerly Chief Justice and also a member of the Nicaragua
                            Delegation at Montevideo, told me today that our policy of
                            nonrecognition would be the greatest influence for tranquility.</p>
                        <p>Doctor Argüello said that he regarded the situation as “most grave”
                            principally because of the indecision of the President in taking action
                            with respect to the reorganization of the Guardia. Cordero Reyes
                            referred to its development into a politico-military organization which
                            controls not only the results of the elections which it was supposed
                            impartially to supervise but dominates the Executive in the

                        <p>78. Department’s 15, February 26, 5 p.m. I fully appreciate Department’s
                            point of view and am fully sympathetic with the Department’s broader
                            aim. If I may seem to have over-emphasized my own view it is because I
                            wished the Department fully to realize the gravity of the situation. I
                            shall now endeavor to accomplish in personal conversations what I had
                            hoped might have been done in a public statement.</p>
                        <p>Not with a view to persuading the Department to change its attitude but
                            in order that the Department may fully understand the situation, I
                            submit the following:</p>
                        <p>I had not meant to indicate to the Department that the rumor is current
                            that we favor Somoza for the Presidency. Such a rumor has <pb n="542"
                                xml:id="pg_542" facs="0608"/>not reached me and I do not find any
                            record of having so informed the Department. The feeling exists,
                            however, that we favor the Guardia as contrasted with the Government,
                            such feeling being chiefly of the following: <list>

                        <p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me this morning that it is not
                            merely a matter of convincing Somoza but of convincing the whole Guardia
                            which, according to him, is responsible for the circulation of the rumor
                            that I am the intellectual author of the killing of Sandino. He said
                            that the Guardia is convinced that I—and hence the United States
                            Government—favors the Guardia as against the Government.</p>
                        <p>While I have no worthy evidence on the following point, it is possible
                            that the view expressed in the Department’s instruction No. 7, of

                            “It is the Department’s opinion, nevertheless, that the continued
                            maintenance of a Guardia Nacional organized substantially as at present
                            is important to the future peace and welfare of Nicaragua.” (As will be
                            inferred from my letter to Wilson of February 3, I do not entirely share
                            the Department’s view and consequently have not availed myself of the
                            authority contained in the last paragraph of the instruction under

                            Salvador is strong against us because of my alleged complicity in the
                            killing and added that the same sentiment exists throughout Central

                            drafted a bill which would give the Guardia Nacional a legal status. He

                        <p>80. My 79, February 28, 5 p.m. The Ministers of Mexico and El Salvador,
                            both of whom have just arrived, have told me that they had specific
                            instructions to cooperate closely with me in the present situation. I
                            met with them yesterday evening for the purpose of agreeing as to such
                            conciliatory measures as might be taken by us. I acquainted them with
                            the substance of proposed bill regarding the Guardia and stated that I
                            did not wish to express any opinion regarding this bill, and
                            particularly not to approve any action which might be interpreted as a
                            repudiation of the position previously taken by the United States
                            Government with respect to the Guardia. We agreed that a good moral
                            effect would be created if the three of us should go in a body to the
                            President and emphasize to him that our respective Governments are
                            supporting the Constitutional Government of Nicaragua and that, should
                            we be able in the interest of peace to exert our good offices with a
                            view to conciliating divergent opinions, we placed ourselves at his
                            disposal.</p>
                        <p>We thereupon called on the President and the foregoing view was expressed
                            to him by the Minister of Mexico as senior diplomatic representative.
                            The Minister of El Salvador suggested that it might be wise for the sake
                            of harmony to issue an order to the Guardia along the <pb n="544"
                                xml:id="pg_544" facs="0610"/>lines of the proposed bill, it being
                            his feeling that an act of Congress might be resented while the action
                            of the President as Commanding General of the Guardia would be
                            considered to be entirely normal. The Minister of Mexico indicated that
                            he was in accord with this plan. I stated, however, that in the absence
                            of instructions from my Government I did not wish to give my approval,
                            as such approval might be interpreted as a new departure in our attitude
                            towards the Guardia. On the other hand I said that I understood my
                            Government’s present position to be that the question of the Guardia is
                            one for the present Government to determine. We left the President with
                            the understanding that he would issue an order to the Guardia embodying
                            the provisions of the draft law. As the Mexican Minister had told the
                            Minister of El Salvador and myself that his instructions did not permit
                            him to call on General Somoza but would allow him to treat only with the
                            President and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the President having
                            indicated that he had no objection to our using our good offices with
                            General Somoza, the Minister of El Salvador and I determined to see
                            Somoza last night particularly as reports were current yesterday that
                            the crisis between the President and Somoza had been reached. I
                            thereupon telephoned Somoza from the Legation and told him that the
                            Minister of Salvador and I would be grateful if he would consult with
                            us. He told us on reaching the Legation that the Guardia is loyal to the
                            present administration, but that the feelings of the officers and men of
                            the Guardia should be taken into account and that the continued
                            maintenance of measures of military defense at the Presidential house
                            were causing increased irritation and antagonism. Somoza had already
                            been acquainted with the contents of the draft law by Léon Debayle, who
                            had called on him at the request of the President. Somoza said that such
                            a law would not only have a bad effect on the Guardia but would also
                            work against the President, as it would indicate to the country that
                            Sacasa not having enough moral force to issue orders to the Guardia had
                            been forced to take action by the Congress. On being asked by the
                            Minister of Salvador whether he would be agreeable to the issuance of
                            the order by the President, instead of the enactment of the law, Somoza
                            said that he would not object in principle but would greatly prefer if
                            the provisions of the order could be contained in various orders issued
                            from time to time. As I understand it, his feeling is that the Guardia
                            would resent receiving at one blow such a comprehensive and what he
                            termed a “drastic” order. We suggested that sometimes it is wiser to get
                            a thing over with once and for all rather than to drag it out
                            indefinitely. He left us agreeing to call on the President this morning
                            should he be summoned.</p>

                        <p>This morning the President requested the presence of the Ministers of
                            Mexico and El Salvador and of myself. He said that this morning the
                            Commission of Congress, which had called on him yesterday, has been to
                            see him to say that, as this is the last day of the present session, it
                            would be advisable if the bill should be presented to the Congress. The
                            President said he then had told the Commission that he had decided to
                            issue an order which would take the place of the proposed bill.
                            According to the President the Commission objected to such a procedure
                            on the ground that a vote of confidence in the President on the present
                            issue is absolutely essential, especially because of the need to obtain
                            in concrete form an expression of opinion of the Conservative Party. The
                            President, while admitting that the issuance of the order would have a
                            less irritating effect on the Guardia, said that he felt that he should
                            follow the wishes of Congress. He pointed out furthermore that the bill
                            had not originated with him but with certain members of Congress and
                            that he could not constitutionally prevent the bill from being
                            discussed. The other two Ministers and I expressed no opinion regarding
                            this suggested change of procedure but again reiterated our offer to
                            take such conciliatory measures as might seem convenient. The President
                            said that he would inform us of the action taken by Congress.</p>
                        <p>On leaving the President my colleagues and I agreed that, as the matter
                            has reached a purely political stage, it would be improper for us to
                            take any further action.</p>
                        <p>The three of us feel that we have done all that we properly can and the
                            Minister of Salvador and I consider that our conciliatory efforts with
                            Somoza last evening have relieved us of any charge that we are
                            indifferent to the situation. We all feel that it is now a matter for
                            the Government and for Congress to determine.</p>
                        <p>Prior to our meeting last evening with the President, I had an
                            opportunity to have a few words with him at the ceremony yesterday
                            afternoon at which the Minister of El Salvador presented his
                            credentials. I told the President that the plan for me to come to see
                            him not alone but with the other Ministers should not in any way be
                            regarded as a lessening of my desire to be of assistance. On the other
                            hand I felt that joint support of the Constitutional Government by the
                            three Ministers should be helpful.</p>
                        <p>My own view is that the significance of the representatives of Mexico and
                            of the United States acting in accord with respect to Nicaragua will be
                            felt here, and particularly when such action is taken with the
                            concurrence and assistance of El Salvador.</p>

                        <p>82. My 80, March 1, 3 p.m. This afternoon when I called on Minister of
                            Hacienda at Presidential Palace to acquaint him with contents of
                            Department’s instruction No. 35<note n="57" xml:id="d535fn57">Not
                                printed.</note> he said that the President desired to see me. When
                            the President received me he said that the order which had been
                            suggested last evening was ready to be signed, he having seen this
                            morning General Somoza who was in agreement with the terms thereof. I
                            said to the President that I understood from what he had said this
                            morning that bill was to be presented to Congress. He said that I must
                            have misunderstood him and at that time I did not doubt that this was
                            the case. The order is substantially in the same terms as the draft law
                            reported in my 79, February 28, 5 p.m., with two exceptions. Section 5
                            now provides merely that all extraordinary expenses of the Guardia shall
                            be approved by the Commanding General. That part of section 7 which
                            referred to expenditures has been omitted. The President said the order
                            which would be signed immediately by him and countersigned by the
                            Minister of Gobernación would be communicated to General Somoza this
                            evening in the presence of the diplomatic representatives of the
                            American countries, the idea being that our being witnesses to the
                            ceremony would strengthen the President’s position. I repeated to the
                            President that my presence at such a meeting was not to be interpreted
                            as approving the order but that I would be glad to associate myself with
                            my colleagues in any proper way to bring about peace.</p>
                        <p>The President asked me to get in touch with my American colleagues and
                            also with Somoza. On talking with the Minister of Mexico I found that he
                            had the same impression as I regarding the conversation this morning,
                            namely, that the President expressed his intention of having a bill
                            submitted to Congress. The Minister of El Salvador however expressed the
                            opinion that the President was not clear as to whether a law or an order
                            would be issued. A meeting of the American representatives [having?]
                            been fixed at 8 p.m. at the Palace, I called on Somoza to acquaint him
                            with what we understood to be the intention, for the President to summon
                            him to the Palace accompanying my colleagues and myself showing that
                            harmony exists and that the order had his (Somoza’s) approval. Somoza
                            told me that the changes made in the order as mentioned above were
                            suggested by him and that the reason a bill was not introduced in
                            Congress was because it was learned that the Conservatives and
                            Moncadistas would defeat it.</p>
                        <pb n="547" xml:id="pg_547" facs="0613"/>
                        <p>The ceremony at the Palace was simple. The President, having read to us
                            the signed decree, requested Somoza to swear his loyalty to him and to
                            promise obedience before the representatives of friendly countries.
                            Somoza complied with good grace even though it seemed to me that the
                            manner in which the remarks were made to him was humiliating in
                            character. Somoza invited the President and the diplomatic corps to a
                            parade of the Guardia tomorrow to be reviewed by the President.</p>
                        <p>Although the President has probably strengthened his position in the
                            country through this submission on paper on the part of Somoza, the
                            problem appears to be unsolved as long as the President’s lack of
                            confidence as at present requires him to maintain extraordinary war
                            measures about the Palace. Even this afternoon the President indicated
                            to me that he could never have confidence again in Somoza.</p>
                        <p>The tension this evening is sensibly relieved. The President’s action and
                            compliance therewith on the part of Somoza have undoubtedly contributed
                            thereto.</p>

                            the obvious intent of the neutrality laws of the United States is to
                            discountenance the enlistment of American citizens in foreign armed
                            forces.</p>

                            service in Honduras. The Legation was authorized to point out that in

                            relations of the American citizen to his Government was the further
                            objection of the possibility of serious injury to unoffending civilians
                            and to foreign as well as Honduran property resulting from aerial

                        <p>83. My 82, March 1, 11 p.m. I called on the President this morning and
                            had an extended conversation: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>As to the situation in the country. Having said that he had
                                    sent orders to the area commanders and to the chiefs of police
                                    and that until he had their respective reactions as to the order
                                    issued last evening, he would not be able to tell me accurately
                                    as to whether the country was tranquil.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>He said that he would be glad to accept General Somoza’s
                                    invitation to review the Guardia as soon as he had evidence that
                                    matters had reached a more normal stage.</item>
                                <label>3.</label>
                                <item>He said that he had not yet determined whom he would send to
                                    the Central American Conference but indicated (very
                                    confidentially) that Crisanto Sacasa would go with two others,
                                    one of whom would be a Conservative.</item>
                                <label>4.</label>
                                <item>Emphasizing that I was speaking personally as a friend and not
                                    officially, I earnestly requested the President to give serious
                                    consideration to the advisability of normalizing the situation
                                    insofar as his protection is concerned. I expressed the
                                    apprehension lest, if he did not do so, the country would not
                                    feel that the situation had improved. He promised gradually to
                                    reduce defensive measures and said that he was merely waiting to
                                    ascertain the general feeling throughout the country before
                                    taking action.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>The feeling seems to be generally calmer today.</item>

                        <p>85. President told me this morning that situation having improved within
                            last few days he, his family, Ministers Salvatierra and Guerrero
                            Montalván, and Sandino’s father, all of whom had been remaining in
                            Palace since events of February 21, now felt at liberty to appear in
                            town and had done so. I noticed that the defense measures previously
                            described have been reduced.</p>
                        <p>Somoza has indicated to me, however, that the appointment of the
                            President’s cousin Ramon Sacasa as chief of the western area (newly
                            established) with offices in Léon would not serve to enhance relations
                            between the Government and the Guardia.</p>

                        <p>99. This morning, in referring to a general conversation which I had
                            yesterday with the President on the present difficulties relating to the
                            Guardia, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that on the eve of
                            leaving Montevideo he had had a talk with the Secretary (Mr. Cumming
                            acting as interpreter) on the subject of Dr. Argüello’s memorandum
                            regarding the Guardia.<note n="59" xml:id="d539fn59">See instruction No.

                                    849</ref>.</note> The Minister said that he understood the
                            Secretary to say through Mr. Cumming that the Department was entirely in
                            accord with the views expressed in the memorandum; that the Department
                            had no objection to the reformation of the Guardia in such a manner as
                            the Government desired regardless of the agreement (of November 5,
                                1932)<note n="60" xml:id="d539fn60"><ref target="frus1932v05#pg_887"

                            signed in the American Legation and by the American Minister as
                            witnesses, and that I would be so instructed.</p>
                        <p>I said to Dr. Argüello that my understanding of the Department’s position
                            is that the question of the Guardia is one for Nicaragua to decide and
                            for that reason we decline to express any opinion.</p>
                        <p>I gather that the Minister for Foreign Affairs desires to interpret the
                            Secretary’s remarks as an approval of any action which the Government
                            may take in reorganizing the Guardia. My impression is strengthened by
                            the second paragraph of the Secretary’s despatch of December 11, 1933
                            transmitted to me in Department’s instruction 15 of January 16.<note

                        <p>President admits that he has recently increased the Presidential guard by
                            over 100 men all Liberals, because so he says, he must have around him
                            men whom he can trust. The President tacitly agreed that this is not in
                            accordance with the terms of the agreement of 1932.</p>
                        <p>Am reporting fully by air mail my conversation with the President (as
                            well as one yesterday with General Chamorro) on the subject of the
                            Guardia.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate for my guidance the Secretary’s views regarding Dr.
                            Argüello’s above-mentioned statement to me.</p>

                        <p>27. Your 99, March 21, 4 p.m., first paragraph. Dr. Argüello evidently
                            misunderstood me. I made no promise to him other than that I would
                            forward his memorandum to the Department for its consideration, and I
                            entirely approve of the attitude expressed in the Department’s telegram
                            of December 16, 1933, to me at Montevideo (quoted in the Department’s
                            instruction No. 7 of December 28, 1933 to you) to the effect “that the
                            proposed reorganization of the National Guard is not a subject on which
                            it may appropriately express an opinion”. Your statement to Dr. Argüello
                            as contained in paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference is
                            approved.</p>

                        <p>23. Colonel Ferretti, Sandino aide, refugee here in interview in <hi
                                rend="italic">Diario de Costa Rica</hi> today says: “The American
                            Minister is the true Chief of the Guardia Nacional of Nicaragua and with
                            Moncada principal person responsible for the cowardly assassination of
                            my unforgettable chief.”</p>
                        <p>Ferretti in nasty interview also seeks to imply that Minister Lane had
                            advance knowledge of assassination and was one of the conspirators. In

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that yesterday
                            while I was calling at the Foreign Office, General José Maria Moncada,
                            ex-President of the Republic, called at the Legation and left word that
                            he should like to call on me at my residence during the course of the
                            day. Having an appointment with the President at 12:30 P.M., and
                            recalling the allusions which have been made regarding the coincidence
                            of my having had luncheon with General Moncada on February 21 last, I
                            decided not to make an appointment with General Moncada until I had
                            advised the President of the General’s proposed call. President Sacasa,
                            when I advised him of the foregoing, said that he supposed that it would
                            not be possible for me to refuse to see General Moncada and that I had
                            no alternative but to receive him.</p>
                        <p>I told the President that I felt that I should see General Moncada but
                            that I wished to show my good faith to the President in advising him
                            beforehand. I subsequently got in touch with General Moncada and invited
                            him to my house where he spent the greater part of the afternoon.</p>
                        <p>After referring to the events of February 21 and to my having been
                            accused with him as having instigated the killing of Sandino, he said
                            that when he left my house on the afternoon of February 21, he
                            endeavored to get in touch with don Federico Sacasa, brother of the
                            President, to discuss some matters of business in which the two are
                            interested. Not being able to locate don Federico, he said that he had
                            gone for a drive in the direction of Las Piedrecitas and that he had
                            later met the sons of don Federico at a restaurant on that road and had
                            remained with them until about 10:30 P.M. They had heard some shots,
                            whereupon General Moncada, so he said, had suggested that they return to
                            Managua to investigate. Having left the Sacasa boys at their home, he
                            proceeded to leave the city for his home in Masatepe but was stopped by
                            a sentinel on the outskirts of Managua, who, General Moncada said, did
                            not wish to allow him to leave without permission of the Chief of
                            Police. The Chief of Police, according to the General, soon arrived on
                            the scene and told him of the killing of Sandino. The General said that
                            he told me of the above in order to show that he was not present when
                            the killing took place. He said that he had advised General Somoza in
                            the days immediately following the killing to be loyal to President
                            Sacasa, as it was his duty to support the constituted authorities.</p>

                        <p>Referring to my visit to San Salvador and my conference there with Mr.
                                Beaulac,<note n="63" xml:id="d545fn63">The Minister, under
                                instructions from the Department, had proceeded to San Salvador on
                                April 26, where he had consulted for a few days with Frank P.
                                Corrigan, the new Minister to El Salvador, and with Willard Beaulac,
                                Assistant Chief of the Division of Latin American Affairs, on
                                temporary detail in Guatemala.</note> General Moncada said he wished
                            to know what our policy is with respect to the Guardia Nacional, and
                            particularly with regard to possible changes therein which might be made
                            not in accordance with the agreement of 1932. I said that as I
                            understood our policy, it is that the Guardia is a matter entirely for
                            Nicaragua to decide; that Nicaragua as a sovereign nation must decide
                            her internal problems; but that our silence should not be interpreted
                            either as approval or disapproval. (When I saw the Vice-President, Dr.
                            Espinosa, this morning and he asked me the same question, I gave him an
                            identical answer.)</p>
                        <p>General Moncada said that he entirely approved our policy of
                            noninterference, and that he personally did not desire further
                            intervention or further war in Nicaragua. Referring to the forthcoming
                            elections, in which he frankly said that he had made an arrangement with
                            General Chamorro for the latter’s support of General Moncada’s candidacy
                            as Senator from Rivas, he said that when Congress re-opens on May 15, a
                            bill introduced by the Executive and already passed by the Senate would
                            come before the Deputies for consideration, providing that the President
                            of the Nicaraguan Board of Elections shall be nominated by the President
                            and not, as he said is the case now, by Congress. He said that both he
                            and General Chamorro will fight against the passage of this bill, for it
                            would give the Executive even greater power over the elections than is
                            at present contemplated. He said, for instance, that although he feels
                            that he would have an easy majority in Rivas, should he be nominated,
                            his nomination could be prevented should the Executive decide to do so
                            through a government-controlled Board of Elections. He said that the
                            situation in the Nicaraguan elections is somewhat similar to our primary
                            system in the United States. When he asked what the policy of the United
                            States would be with regard to the elections, I replied that we felt
                            that we should take no part therein either directly or indirectly, and
                            should use no influence in any way in connection therewith. General
                            Moncada said he fully understood this situation, but said that although
                            neither he nor General Chamorro wished a conflict (he added that they
                            were both too old and too tired for war), they intended to insist on
                            free elections. As I recall, I commented substantially as follows:

                        <p>General Moncada said that was all he wished to know; that an expression
                            from us regarding the freedom of the elections would, he felt sure, help
                            to realize such a hope; and that this statement on my part, entirely
                            satisfied him.</p>

                            some question in my mind as to how the “Hands Off” and “Good Neighbor”
                            policies should or may be reconciled. I feel, and so felt at the time my
                            despatch No. 147 was written and was consequently guided accordingly,
                            that we should not interfere in Nicaraguan internal affairs; should we
                            feel, however, that a word from us might serve to maintain the peace of
                            the country and consequently avoid bloodshed and disorder, we should not
                            refrain from assuming the responsibility of the “Good Neighbor” by
                            expressing our views, preferably as the personal views of our diplomatic
                            representative.</p>
                        <p>Should the Department consider it desirable, I should appreciate an
                            expression of opinion on my interpretation of our policy.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith,
                            translations of an anonymous letter received by the Legation on June 11,
                                1934,<note n="64" xml:id="d547fn64">Not printed.</note> in an
                            envelope bearing the return address, “Students, Léon, Nicaragua”.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the letter is critical of the political activities
                            of General Anastasio Somoza and the Guardia Nacional, and the alleged
                            connection of this Legation therewith. While it is in itself
                            unimportant, <pb n="555" xml:id="pg_555" facs="0621"/>it is typical of a
                            number of other less literate communications along the same lines
                            received by the Legation from time to time, and expresses a point of
                            view widely held in Nicaragua and probably throughout northern Latin
                            America. On mentioning this matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            on June 14, Dr. Argüello confirmed my belief that the impression is
                            current regarding our supporting the Guardia Nacional and the political
                            activities of General Somoza. As an indication of this sentiment he
                            showed me a letter which he had received from a friend of his in Léon
                            reporting the circulation of a rumor there to the effect that I am
                            supporting the candidacy of General Somoza for President in the
                            elections of 1936.</p>
                        <p>The Department will recall that in my telegram No. 78 of February 27—6
                            P.M., I reported the feeling then current that we favored the Guardia as
                            contrasted with the Government, based on the following reasons: <list>

                        <p>I regret to report that the feeling as reported in February still

                            as well. Mr. Dawson<note n="66" xml:id="d547fn66">Allan Dawson, Second

                        <p>131. My telegram No. 130, June 19, noon. Minister for Foreign Affairs
                            advised me this morning on what he termed unquestionable authority that
                            during the festivities at Granada, but not in a public speech, General
                            Somoza had indicated (1) that I am furnishing the motive power for his
                            ambitions and (2) that, despite my having declined the invitation to be
                            present at the festivities because of my name having been brought into
                            Sandino affair, I am backing him. (The fact is that I declined the
                            invitation by telegraph on the ground of my wife’s being in mourning and
                            explained to Somoza personally that as the festivities were generally
                            considered to be of a political character my presence would undoubtedly
                            be misconstrued.)</p>
                        <p>The President this noon confirmed the reports given me by Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs and said that his Government is seriously embarrassed
                            particularly outside of the country, by Somoza’s admission of
                            responsibility for the death of Sandino in view of the earlier
                            declarations made by Somoza that a complete investigation would be made
                            to ascertain the guilty parties. He said he would like to get rid of
                            Somoza to show that he, Sacasa, disapproves. He expressed apprehension,
                            however, lest such action might throw the Guardia into revolt against
                            the Government.</p>

                            which President Sacasa approves. If the Department approves, it should
                            be given to press here not later than early Saturday afternoon, in order
                            to be published in Sunday morning press. No local newspapers on

                            <p>“Unfounded and malicious rumors have been circulated, both in
                                Nicaragua and elsewhere, to the effect that certain acts committed
                                in Nicaragua in February, last, were approved and instigated by me.
                                Until now I have felt that these rumors should not be dignified by a
                                denial on my part.</p>
                            <p>During the past week, however, these rumors have been circulated with
                                increased intensity and have apparently created an impression in
                                some quarters that the political activities of certain elements have
                                my personal support, and, inferentially, the support of my
                                Government. I am constrained most emphatically to brand such rumors
                                as unqualified falsehoods.</p>
                            <p>As I publicly stated on December 7, 1933, on the occasion of the
                                presentation of my letters of credence to His Excellency, President
                                Sacasa, the relations of the United States and Nicaragua must be
                                based on mutual recognition and respect of sovereignty. This being
                                the case, neither the United States Government nor its
                                representative in Nicaragua is interfering in any manner in the
                                political affairs of this country.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing statement has the approval of the Department of
                                State.”</p>

                            arms, respectively, for the Government of Nicaragua and for the Guardia
                            Nacional de Nicaragua. In this connection I refer to my telegram No. 123
                            of today<note n="70" xml:id="d553fn70">Not printed.</note> suggesting
                            that the Department withhold the issuance of further licenses for the
                            exportation of arms and ammunition to Nicaragua pending the receipt of
                            the instant despatch.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday prior to my informing the Minister of Foreign Affairs, as has
                            been the practice of the Legation prior to and subsequent to my arrival
                            here, of the granting of the licenses in question, I requested the
                            President for information regarding the shipments. Doctor Sacasa said
                            that the shipment of 100,000 38 Automatic Colt Cartridges from the
                            Winchester Repeating Arms Company (Department’s instruction No. 69 of
                            April 30) had been ordered by the Nicaraguan Government (as contrasted
                            to the Guardia) for the defense of the Presidential Loma. As to the
                            shipment to which reference is made in the Department’s instruction No.
                            71 of May 4 the President said that this had been ordered without his
                            knowledge or consent but that it had come to his attention when the
                            Nicaraguan Consul General in New York refused to issue the necessary
                            papers (I gather he referred to consular invoice) for importation into
                            Nicaragua without the consent of the Government of Nicaragua, whereupon
                            the matter was referred to the President (Doctor Sacasa said that much
                            of this shipment is for sale to private parties and that he does not
                            object to the importation but to the fact that the Guardia ordered the
                            shipment without consulting him, the Commanding General).</p>
                        <p>It seems to me that there are two serious practical objections to our
                            issuing licenses to export arms to Nicaragua, quite apart from the
                            inadvisability, as I see it, of our inviting the accusation that we are
                            responsible, even in an indirect manner, for internal developments here:

                                <item>As I have in the past pointed out to the Department, the
                                    heaviest drain on the Government budget is the Guardia, which in
                                    the last month according to what the newly appointed Minister of
                                    Hacienda told me on May 17, spent C$30,000.00 over its budgeted
                                    allotment of C$65,000.00. It appears to me that by our granting
                                    export licenses we become parties, even though perhaps
                                    indirectly, to excessive expenditures of public funds for

                                    the 100,000 machine gun cartridges ordered by the Government are
                                    for possible use against the Guardia. (Military defense
                                    construction still continues on the Loma, and specifically a
                                    concrete machine-gun post placed in a position, so our Military
                                    Attaché informed me when he was here on a recent visit, to repel
                                    attacks from the Campo de Marte, the headquarters of the
                                    Guardia.) While it may be true that much of the shipment ordered
                                    by the Guardia is for sale to private individuals, I consider
                                    this unlikely. It seems, more logical that it is intended for
                                    offensive or defensive purposes, and now that Sandino has been
                                    eliminated it is difficult to understand against whom, outside
                                    of the Government, such large quantities of ammunition would be
                                    required. I fear that if we continue to issue such licenses, we
                                    are liable to lay ourselves open to the charge of arming the two

                        <p>To refuse to allow any shipments of arms or ammunition to Nicaragua would
                            presumably not prevent arms from reaching this country but would merely
                            serve to divert Nicaraguan orders to European manufacturers. (This was
                            the result of our action in 1927 when we refused to allow the
                            exportation of any war material from the United States to Mexico, under
                            the terms of the arms embargo which was then in force with respect to
                                Mexico.)<note n="72" xml:id="d553fn72">See <ref

                            of licenses for the exportation of arms and munitions of war to

                                facs="0627"/>to recommend that the embargo be lifted in the case of

                            displeasing to President Sacasa and will not be likely to prejudice his
                            Government. For your information the Department has informed the
                            Legation at Tegucigalpa that it is contemplating similar action in the
                            case of Honduras.<note n="73" xml:id="d554fn73">See <ref

                        <p>You are therefore authorized to inform President Sacasa that the United
                            States Government is contemplating lifting the embargo on arms shipments
                            to Nicaragua in view of the circumstance that the country is tranquil
                            and the conditions which gave rise to the embargo have ceased to exist.
                            You may express to President Sacasa the hope that the removal of the
                            embargo will be agreeable to him.</p>

                            No. 86 of June 6, 1934, I have the honor to report that yesterday
                            morning I took up with President Sacasa the general question of the
                            embargo on the exportation of arms and munitions from the United States
                            to Nicaragua. Specifically I referred to the shipment of ammunition
                            referred to in the Department’s instruction No. 89 of June 15,
                                1934,<note n="74" xml:id="d555fn74">Not printed.</note> a permit for
                            which the Department granted for the Guardia Nacional. I was orally
                            informed this morning by the Secretary of the Comandancia General that
                            the Comandante General (the President) did not give authorization for
                            this shipment and had no knowledge thereof.</p>
                        <p>When I suggested to the President the possibility of our lifting the
                            embargo on the shipment of arms and munitions to Nicaragua, provided he
                            had no objection, Doctor Sacasa immediately replied that the possibility
                            of revolution would be increased by such action; that there would be no
                            remaining check available to the Nicaraguan Government on arms shipments
                            to Nicaragua, and that he hoped some other procedure would be
                            adopted.</p>
                        <p>As an alternative I suggested (making it plain that I was speaking merely
                            for myself and not for my Government) that in future all requests for
                            exportation of arms and munitions to Nicaragua be made <pb n="562"
                                xml:id="pg_562" facs="0628"/>through the Nicaraguan Legation in
                            Washington, which would be responsible to the Department for the
                            authenticity of the purchase and for the approval thereof on the part of
                            the Government of Nicaragua. The President indicated that such a
                            procedure would be agreeable to him. (This was the procedure adopted by
                            the Department during the disturbances in Mexico in 1929,<note n="75"
                                xml:id="d555fn75">For correspondence concerning the insurrection in

                            being responsible to the Department that shipments of arms and munitions
                            approved by the Embassy should be in accordance with the wishes of the
                            Mexican Government. It was the Department’s practice not to issue any
                            export licenses unless the request was submitted through and had the
                            approval of the Mexican Embassy in Washington.)</p>
                        <p>In view of the expressed feeling of President Sacasa I have the honor
                            consequently to modify the recommendations contained in my despatch No.
                            224 of May 22, 1934. I respectfully suggest that in future no shipments
                            to Nicaragua of war material be permitted by the United States
                            Government unless such shipments are requested through and approved by
                            the Nicaraguan Legation at Washington. Should requests be made of the
                            respective Nicaraguan consular officers in the United States, it would
                            be expected that such requests would be referred to the Legation for
                            appropriate action.</p>
                        <p>I should appreciate it if the Department would advise me if and when it
                            has determined the course it will follow in the future in this matter,
                            furnishing me, as well, with the details of the procedure which is to be
                            followed in each case, in order that confirmation may be effected at
                            this end.</p>
                        <p>Because of recent political developments here, which resulted in my
                            recommending that a statement of policy be made regarding our

                            25,—that we do not support the political activities of the Guardia, that
                            we do not regard the Guardia as a super-Government, and that the
                            constitutionally constituted Government of Nicaragua is the normal
                            channel through which we conduct our relations.</p>

                            in Washington that the prospective shipment has the approval of the
                            Nicaraguan Government. This practice will be followed regardless of
                            whether the consignee in Nicaragua is the Government, an agency of the
                            Government, a firm, or an individual; and it will apply to arms and
                            munitions of all classes, including arms and their ammunition ordinarily
                            used for sporting purposes.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in the case of each shipment of arms and munitions, the Department
                            will require, not only that an application for an export license be made
                            by the shipper as heretofore, but also that the Nicaraguan Legation in
                            Washington advise the Department that the shipment has the approval of
                            the Nicaraguan Government, it being understood that in no case will the
                            Department of State take the initiative in seeking such an expression of
                            approval from the Nicaraguan Legation. The question of bringing about
                            such notification to the Department through the Nicaraguan Legation is a
                            matter with regard to which the initiative and responsibility will lie
                            with the Nicaraguan Government and the potential shipper or
                            consignee.</p>
                        <p>With reference to dynamite, blasting powder, and like materials, intended
                            for industrial use, the Department will continue to issue licenses in
                            its own discretion.</p>
                        <p>You will please inform the Nicaraguan Government of the foregoing and
                            notify the Department as soon as acknowledgement of your communication
                            is made.</p>

                            of July 30 informs you that licenses for the exportation of arms and
                            munitions will be issued in the future only after the Department has
                            been informed by the Nicaraguan Legation in Washington that the
                            prospective shipments have the approval of the Nicaraguan Government.
                            This policy will be placed in effect as soon as the Department learns
                            that the Nicaraguan Government has acknowledged the receipt of your

                            1253 of April 29, 1933,<note n="79" xml:id="d560fn1">Not printed.</note>
                            concerning informal discussions with Judge Stanley with respect to the
                            prolongation of the life of the Claims Commission which will, unless
                            extended, complete its work by the end of this year. Reference is also
                            made to your despatch No. 1275 of May 12, 1933,<note n="79"
                                xml:id="d560fn2">Not printed.</note> concerning the making of some
                            adequate provision for the payment of the awards of the Commission.</p>
                        <p>The Department concurs in your view that it is desirable that the life of
                            the Commission be continued until all claims matters against the
                            Nicaraguan Government have been settled. The Department believes that
                            there is every reason why such action would be beneficial not only to
                            the claimants but to the Nicaraguan Government as well. Settlement of
                            outstanding matters of this nature would remove possible causes of
                            friction between the Government of Nicaragua and foreign governments and
                            in addition be an expeditious way of eliminating the loss of much time
                            and effort in an endeavor to settle such matters through diplomatic
                            channels.</p>
                        <p>Economically the continuation of the Commission’s work could not help but
                            be of great benefit to the Nicaraguan Government by determining
                            definitely the obligations of that Government to foreigners, thus
                            permitting it more easily to put its financial house in order.
                            Furthermore, the settlement of claims in this way is a much more
                            economical procedure than a resort to arbitration or the establishment
                            of claims commissions between the interested governments.</p>
                        <p>For these reasons the Department authorizes you to discuss the subject
                            with the Nicaraguan Government in an effort to obtain the results
                            referred to. However, before the elimination of any category of claims
                            is decided upon the Department should be fully informed concerning such
                            proposed elimination and its authorization therefor obtained. You are
                            also authorized to indicate in such manner as you may deem proper the
                            interest of this Government in the final settlement of the claims by the

                            No. 579 of June 9, 1933, File No. 417.00/468 [<hi rend="italic"
                            >469</hi>], concerning the possible prolongation of the life of the
                            Nicaraguan Claims Commission until all claims against the Nicaraguan
                            Government have been settled, I have the honor to enclose a copy and
                            translation of a bill presented to the Congress by the Minister of
                            Finance, together with a copy and translation<note n="81"
                                xml:id="d561fn81">Not printed.</note> of his transmitting letters,
                            providing for the continuation of the Claims Commission until not later
                            than June 30, 1934, and extending its jurisdiction to include claims
                            against the Nicaraguan Government over which the Commission has no
                            jurisdiction at the present time. This bill was published in <hi
                                rend="italic">La Gaceta</hi> of June 27, 1933, and came to the
                            attention of the Legation on the same day that the Department’s
                            instruction was received.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed that according to Article 1 of the enclosed bill, the
                            Claims Commission will have jurisdiction over every claim against the
                            Government with the exception of salary claims and budgetary services
                            which have arisen since the creation of the Claims Commission, and
                            excepting also claims for indemnification for exactions, requisitions
                            and war damages suffered prior to June 30, 1927. A time limit of four
                            months from the publication of the law is fixed within which claims must
                            be presented.</p>
                        <p>Article 3 of the bill apparently provides that the representative of the
                            Government may propose to the Commission that it render a decision on
                            any such claim whatsoever, whether or not the interested person presents
                            a petition. I have had as yet no opportunity to discuss this clause with
                            any member of the Claims Commission or the Government, but at first
                            glance both the wording and the purpose of this article seem somewhat
                            obscure.</p>
                        <p>As the Department is aware, Judge Stanley, President of the Claims
                            Commission is now in the United States, and Dr, Guerrero Montalván, the
                            Minister of Finance, is expected to arrive there about July 2 on a <pb
                                n="567" xml:id="pg_567" facs="0633"/>financial mission for the
                            Nicaraguan Government.<note n="82" xml:id="d561fn82">See <ref
                                    target="#pg_575">pp. 575</ref> ff.</note> It is believed that
                            both these gentlemen will call at the Department, and an opportunity may
                            be presented to discuss the subject with them. In the meantime I shall
                            take up the matter with President Sacasa on the first suitable occasion,
                            informing him of the Department’s views in the premises.</p>
                        <p>Present indications are that the Nicaraguan Congress will adjourn in the
                            near future without having acted on this bill. In that event the
                            commission might be given provisional and temporary authority by
                            Executive decree as suggested in my despatch No. 1253 of April 29,

                                printed.</note> enclosing a copy of the law recently enacted by the
                            Nicaraguan Congress extending the life of the Nicaraguan Claims
                            Commission to June 30, 1934.</p>
                        <p>For reasons previously indicated to you, the Department regards the new
                            law with approval and considers that Article 1 thereof extending the
                            jurisdiction of the Commission to include every claim against the
                            Government gives an excellent opportunity to obtain the adjudication of
                            outstanding American claims against Nicaragua that did not previously
                            come within the jurisdiction of the Commission. To this end the
                            Department will notify all American claimants of record of the extended
                            jurisdiction of the Commission and advise them to bring their claims to
                            its attention.</p>
                        <p>In view of the fact, however, that most of these claimants are not
                            residents of Nicaragua, the Department considers that the limitation of
                            four months for the filing of claims, contained in Article 2 of the new
                            law, should be extended to at least six months. It appears that under
                            Article 4, claimants will have further time in which to fully support
                            their claims by appropriate evidence.</p>
                        <p>While, as stated, the Department considers the extension of the
                            Commission’s jurisdiction a favorable opportunity for settling claims
                            against Nicaragua that might otherwise be the subject of diplomatic
                            negotiation or of arbitration, it considers it pertinent to point out
                            that the Commission is a municipal tribunal whose acts are not binding
                            on the United States and therefore that claims against Nicaragua <pb
                                n="568" xml:id="pg_568" facs="0634"/>not brought to the Commission’s
                            attention under the new law or not decided by the Commission could not
                            be considered as barred from future presentation through diplomatic
                            channels should their merits seem to warrant such action. Furthermore,
                            while it is improbable that any such course will be necessary, this
                            Government reserves the right to present to the Nicaraguan Government
                            any claim decided by the Commission, should the Commission’s decision be
                            so patently unjust as to constitute a denial of justice in the
                            international sense.</p>
                        <p>With the exception of the time within which claims may be filed and with
                            the understandings mentioned, the Department is in complete sympathy
                            with the new law and you may so inform President Sacasa.</p>
                        <p>When informing the Department of the publication of the law please
                                cable,<note n="85" xml:id="d562fn85">By telegram No. 51, August 20,

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Supplementing my despatch No. 1424 of
                            August 21, 1933,<note n="86" xml:id="d563fn86">Not printed.</note>
                            concerning the law recently passed by the Nicaraguan Congress prolonging
                            the life of the Nicaraguan Claims Commission, I have the honor to report
                            that the British Chargé d’Affaires had a conversation with me yesterday
                            in which he expressed the opinion that his Government might raise
                            objections to Article 6 of the law.</p>
                        <p>The sense of Article 6 appears to be that no claim embraced in the terms
                            of the law may be heard in any other manner than that prescribed in the
                            law nor by any authority other than the Claims Commission. The British
                            Chargé said he thought his Government might object to this article in
                            general and more specifically with respect to claims he has recently
                            presented to this Government growing out of the killing of British
                            subjects on the East Coast of Nicaragua by Nicaraguan outlaws. The
                            British Chargé manifestly desired to learn the attitude of the
                            Government of the United States in this connection but I evaded giving
                            him any indication of the Department’s attitude as set forth in its
                            instruction No. 618 of July 29. The British Chargé said he probably
                            would present the point informally to this Government pending the
                            receipt of instructions from London.</p>
                        <pb n="569" xml:id="pg_569" facs="0635"/>
                        <p>I have read the Department’s instruction No. 618 to Judge Stanley, who
                            returned to Managua, yesterday, and he has recalled that the original
                            law creating the Claims Commission contained a provision to the effect
                            that the decisions of the Commission shall be final and without
                            recourse. Judge Stanley appeared to be of the opinion that the original
                            law continues in full force and effect with respect to the new lot of
                            claims covered by the new law, excepting insofar as the new law may
                            modify the previous law.</p>
                        <p>I asked Judge Stanley for his opinion concerning the adequacy of the time
                            limit of four months fixed in Article 2 of the law. He said he thought
                            it improbable that an extension of this time limit would be necessary,
                            but that it is his intention to ask for such extension if and when it
                            should appear necessary. It is probable that the Nicaraguan Congress
                            will be convened in extra session in the near future and Judge Stanley
                            thinks this point will be cleared up by that time. The extension would
                            have to be made by the Congress.</p>
                        <p>Judge Stanley told me that it is his intention to urge the enactment of
                            the project for an issue of bonds with which to pay adjudicated claims,
                            which was submitted to the Nicaraguan Congress at its last session, in
                            case the Congress should be called together in extra session.</p>

                            certain exceptions the Department is in complete sympathy with the new
                            law prolonging the life of the Nicaraguan Claims Commission, I have the
                            honor to report that in a letter to President Sacasa dated August 8,
                            1933, Minister Hanna transmitted the contents of the Department’s
                            instruction pointing out that the time limit of four months for the
                            filing of claims seemed somewhat inadequate and that the Department
                            considered it pertinent to point out further that the Commission is a
                            municipal tribunal whose acts are not binding on the United States and
                            therefore that claims against Nicaragua not brought to the Commission’s
                            attention under the new law or not decided by the Commission could not
                            be considered as barred from future presentation through diplomatic
                            channels should their merits seem to warrant such action. The President
                            was also informed that the Government of the United States reserves the
                            right to present to the Nicaraguan Government any claim decided by the
                            Commission, should the Commission’s decision be so patently unjust as to
                            constitute a denial of justice in the international sense.</p>
                        <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0636"/>
                        <p>Under date of August 30, 1933, President Sacasa replied to the Minister’s
                            letter stating that he believed the observation of the State Department
                            that the time limit of four months might conveniently be extended to six
                            months was justifiable and that he would be willing to request
                            Congressional action to bring this about, if the State Department should
                            so desire.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the reservations made by the Department covering claims
                            not brought to the Commission’s attention under the new law or the
                            adjudication of which might constitute a denial of justice in the
                            international sense, the President considered these reservations to be
                            unjustifiable, since they did not seem to be in harmony with the
                            generally accepted principles of international law. In discussing this
                            point the President referred to the Convention relative to the Eights of
                            Aliens, signed at the Second International American Conference of Mexico
                            in 1902.<note n="87" xml:id="d564fn87">Second International Conference

                            Although the Government of the United States was represented at that
                            Conference, it is believed pertinent to point out that according to the
                            report thereof published by the Government Printing Office in Washington
                            in 1902, the American representatives did not sign this Convention. A
                            copy and translation of the President’s letter of August 30, 1933, are
                            enclosed herewith.<note n="88" xml:id="d564fn88">Not printed</note></p>
                        <p>On September 8, 1933, I had occasion to converse with Judge Stanley and
                            asked him his opinion with respect to the President’s attitude toward
                            the reservations made by the State Department. He stated the President
                            had already discussed the subject with him and appeared incensed because
                            the Department had made such reservations in connection with the
                            recently enacted law. According to Judge Stanley, the President
                            exclaimed: “What is the use of having a Claims Commission if its
                            decisions are not accepted”.</p>

                            19, 1934, and No. 287 of June 23, 1934,<note n="90" xml:id="d566fn1"
                                >Neither printed.</note> covering the status of the proposed bond
                            law to meet awards of the Nicaraguan Claims Commission, and particularly
                            to pages 3 to 5 of the former, in which I summarized a conversation with
                            Judge J. S. Stanley, President of the Commission, I have the honor to
                            transmit herewith, copies of a letter dated June 23 addressed to me by
                            Judge Stanley.<note n="91" xml:id="d566fn2">Not printed.</note> Copies
                            of my reply dated today are also enclosed.<note n="91" xml:id="d566fn3"
                                >Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>It will be noted that Judge Stanley renews his advocacy of a cash
                            settlement of the awards of the Commission or, failing that, the
                            issuance of sound bonds drawing interest from the date of issue. He
                            states his opinion that the “lack of suggestions or recommendations”,
                            with one exception, by representatives of foreign powers as to the
                            method by which awards to their nationals should be settled has
                            encouraged the Nicaraguan Government in its desire for a bond issue on
                            which service would be deferred. He suggests that representations along
                            these lines would be of assistance in securing the sort of settlement he
                            envisages.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>I am in agreement with Judge Stanley that adequate legal provisions for
                            meeting the awards are much to be desired and that there is a strong
                            possibility that, unless pressure is brought to bear, the Nicaraguan
                            Congress will either provide for a bond issue under such conditions as
                            to make its market value negligible or take no action for payment of
                            awards. I do not, however, feel that the desirability of securing fair
                            treatment for claimants would justify representations by the Legation
                            which would inevitably be considered an attempt to influence the course
                            of pending legislation. I shall, in the absence of instructions from the
                            Department to pursue another course, continue to refrain from expressing
                            any opinion concerning the manner in which awards should be paid.</p>
                        <p>I have already, in the portion of despatch No. 282 to which special
                            reference is made above, explained to the Department my belief that
                            Judge Stanley’s efforts to influence the form of the proposed bond law
                            are not consonant with his judicial position as a member of the Claims
                            Commission.</p>

                            1934.</p>
                        <p>Inasmuch as there were still a number of unadjudicated claims before the
                            Commission at the expiration of its mandate, a bill was presented to
                            Congress in late June for the purpose of extending the period of time
                            during which it can consider claims until August 31, 1934, and the life
                            of the Secretariat of the Commission to September 30, 1934. This bill is
                            now before the Chamber of Deputies but action on it as well as on the
                            proposed legislation to provide means for meeting the Commission’s major
                            awards has been delayed.<note n="93" xml:id="d567fn93">The bill
                                extending the life of the Commission to August 31, 1934, and its

                        <p>The ostensible reason for the delay is that the Chamber has wished to
                            devote its time exclusively to consideration of the budget for the
                            1934–1935 fiscal year which was presented to Congress on June 27. I am
                            informed reliably, however, that the real cause is a desire to await the
                            return from New York of Mr. Hans Sitarz, Manager of the National Bank of
                            Nicaragua, with word of the reaction of the Board of Directors of the
                            Bank to the suggestion that it loan the Nicaraguan Government
                            C$600,000.00 for use in cash settlement of the claims.</p>

                            confidential despatch No. 293 of June 26, 1934, with further reference
                            to the proposed bond law to satisfy the awards of the Nicaraguan Claims
                            Commission.</p>
                        <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0639"/>
                        <p>Your course of action in this matter is approved. As has previously been
                            pointed out, the Commission is a domestic tribunal and the matter of its
                            operation as well as the means which shall be provided to meet its
                            awards are purely domestic questions. While the Department is desirous
                            that American claimants shall obtain a just settlement of their claims,
                            it does not consider that formal representations in their behalf are
                            warranted in the present circumstances. However, should your opinion be
                            requested by the Nicaraguan authorities, or should a favorable
                            opportunity for expressing it arise, you may point out that a just
                            settlement of the claims would seem to be in the interest of the
                            Nicaraguan Government, since otherwise the claims may become the subject
                            of diplomatic discussion. The rendering of an award without providing
                            the means to satisfy it does not, of course, discharge the obligations
                            of the Nicaraguan Government toward the claimants.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                            its major awards, particularly to despatch No. 400 of August 16,
                                1934,<note n="94" xml:id="d569fn1">Not printed.</note> transmitting
                            copies of a letter from Judge J. S. Stanley, President of the
                            Commission, to President Sacasa enquiring as to the Commission’s future,
                            I have the honor to enclose copies of a reply from President Sacasa,
                            dated August 23, 1934,<note n="94" xml:id="d569fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            which was shown to me this morning by Judge Stanley.</p>
                        <p>It will be noted that the President’s letter expresses his personal
                            opinion that the Board of Directors of the National Bank will extend the
                            desired loan of C$700,000 to the Government for payment of all pending
                            awards of the Claims Commission in cash. Mr. Hans Sitarz, General
                            Manager of the National Bank informs me that he is by no means certain
                            that this will be the case. He states that his own recommendation is now
                            adverse in view of the introduction by the Minister of Finance on August
                            22 of a bill for the active establishment of a National Mortgage Bank
                            which will, in his opinion, involve inflation. He says, further, that,
                            should the loan be made, he is convinced that one of the conditions laid
                            down will be for direct payment of awards to claimants by the Bank
                            instead of the advance of the funds to the Government for payment by the
                            latter.…</p>

                        <p>Judge Stanley advised me that the House on August 22 passed a bill
                            introduced by General Andrés Murillo, generally accepted as the Sacasa
                            administration’s floor leader, which would extend the life of the
                            Commission to December 31, 1934, but authorize the President to
                            terminate it at an earlier date should the Commission’s work be brought
                            to a close before that time (yesterday’s press reported this action). He
                            stated that Onofre Sandoval, the administration leader in the Senate,
                            had assured him that the bill would be quickly approved in that body
                            also, probably today.</p>
                        <p>Judge Stanley said that he hoped that the work of the Commission proper
                            could be finished by September 20 although it would probably be
                            necessary for one member of the Commission, its secretary and several
                            employees to remain at their desks for about six weeks longer to draw up
                            the Commission’s final report<note n="95" xml:id="d569fn3">Copy of final
                                report of the Commission was transmitted to the Department in
                                despatch No. 1133, November 1, 1935, from the Chargé in Nicaragua;
                                not printed.</note> and attend to other pending details. Judge
                            Stanley remarked that he had already reserved passage on a vessel
                            sailing September 25.</p>
                        <p>In discussing the Commission’s work, Judge Stanley commented that it
                            would have been easily possible for it to complete its tasks by June 30,
                            1934, had it not been for extensions by the Nicaraguan Government of the
                            time limit for filing claims and uncertainty as to the manner in which
                            major awards were to be paid. He said that the Commission intended to
                            leave in its files two awards in each pending case, one specifying
                            payment of a certain sum, in bonds, and the other half the amount of the
                            first, in cash, because of doubt as to whether the loan from the
                            National Bank would actually be granted.</p>

                            the remaining C$250,000 would be at the disposal of the Nicaraguan
                            Government for “other expenses.” He stated that, after negotiations
                            between the Government and the Bank, it had been agreed that the payment
                            of awards should be made by the Ministry of Finance instead of by the
                            Bank, as had originally been desired by the Board of Directors, but that
                            disbursements would be checked by the Bank against a list of awards to

                            <p>Nicaragua has not been able to avoid the influence which the special
                                circumstances afflicting the world have necessarily introduced into
                                the economic life of the country and its fiscal organization. Its
                                Government budget has been out of balance since 1931, to such an
                                extent that during the single calendar year 1932 the deficit
                                increased by more than C$1,158,000, a figure much too high for a
                                total of C$3,300,000 provided for the purely administrative services
                                of the Government. The total income available for these services
                                during that year, including a little more than C$508,500 in customs
                                revenues which the creditors having a lien on the revenues permitted
                                the Government to dispose of, and C$508,684 additional which
                                although assigned to special purposes were applied under temporary
                                legislation to the payment of the general budget, barely reached the
                                sum of C$2,193,551.16.</p>
                            <p>President Sacasa, from the beginning of his term and despite the
                                natural resistance against this kind of effort, has been endeavoring
                                to reduce all expenses for the purpose of balancing the budget.
                                Little by little, as far as his constitutional powers have permitted
                                him, he has progressively reduced the expenditures of various
                                administrative services, suppressing posts which have not appeared
                                to be strictly necessary and making a reduction of approximately 20
                                percent, in addition to another 20 percent which had been applied in
                                1931, in salaries of Government employees. Continuing in this
                                endeavor, he proposes to extend the reductions to all the other
                                services.</p>
                            <p>Of the fiscal income of 1932, C$1,248,757.93, that is to say almost
                                two-thirds, were absorbed by the maintenance of the Guardia
                                Nacional, which received a total of C$1,344,568.23. This institution
                                continues to merit all the attention and support necessary for the
                                maintenance of public order and tranquillity, and it is the
                                Government’s plan to impose upon itself whatever sacrifices are
                                necessary to insure the Guardia’s efficiency and prestige, but the
                                inevitable reduction in the cost of this institution because of
                                various circumstances has only been carried out to a very slight
                                degree. Nevertheless, the fact that it was created by an agreement
                                with the Government of the United States,<note n="2"

                                Department of State of the great need, in so far as the maintenance
                                of order and public security in consonance with the economic
                                possibilities of the country will permit it, to make a reduction in
                                the personnel of the Guardia Nacional and in the salaries assigned
                                    <pb n="577" xml:id="pg_577" facs="0643"/>to its members, which
                                were fixed as is well known without any appreciable reduction having
                                been made since the year 1929, one of the most prosperous years, and
                                perhaps the year the income of the Government reached its highest
                                point.</p>
                            <p>For the fiscal year which began July 1, 1933, there can be no doubt
                                that income will be even lower than the figure reached during the
                                year which ended June 30 last. The Government will be unable to
                                apply to the maintenance of this institution two-thirds of the total
                                of its income with manifest injury and neglect of the other branches
                                of the administration in which, as has been stated, the personnel
                                employed, and their salaries, have been reduced to the point that
                                circumstances in the country have permitted.</p>
                            <p>The office of Collector General of Customs was also instituted in
                                accordance with contracts which the Government of Nicaragua made
                                with bankers of the United States following recommendations of the
                                Department of State. This circumstance, although the obligations
                                contracted by the Government with those bankers have terminated,
                                induces the Government of Nicaragua to comply with the duty of
                                informing the Department of State of the Government’s intention to
                                proceed to a general revision of the expenses and remuneration,
                                likewise fixed at times of prosperity and when the State had more
                                funds available, in order to reduce them all in the just proportion
                                which corresponds to present circumstances, and which is related to
                                the sums which the Government also necessarily must apply to the
                                other services of the administration.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith
                            copies of the Spanish and English texts of the report of the Collector
                            General of Customs of Nicaragua (Mr. Irving A. Lindberg) for the
                            calendar year 1933.<note n="3" xml:id="d572fn3">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>When I received the English text last week, I called on Mr. Lindberg and
                            expressed my surprise that the report was addressed to the President of
                            Nicaragua, the Minister of Hacienda of Nicaragua and the Secretary of
                            State of the United States. I pointed out that while the procedure
                            followed was undoubtedly merely a continuation of the practice during
                            the intervention, I considered it most unwise to give to the public a
                            false impression of the present attitude of the Government of the United
                            States, which wishes in every way not only to respect <pb n="578"
                                xml:id="pg_578" facs="0644"/>the sovereignty of Nicaragua, but to
                            give tangible evidence thereof. I referred specifically to current
                            charges that we are exercising an economic and financial control over
                            Nicaragua and said that if it were known that he addressed his reports
                            to the Secretary of State, it would of course be assumed that he
                            received his instructions from the Department.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lindberg made the point that he had been appointed on the nomination
                            of the then Secretary of State; that he had always submitted his reports
                            to the Secretary as a matter of courtesy; but that he would be happy to
                            comply with my wishes. Accordingly he promised me that the Spanish,
                            which he said was the official, text of his report for 1933 would not be
                            addressed to the Secretary of State. As the English text had already
                            been printed and issued, it was not possible to make the desired change
                            therein.</p>
                        <p>I likewise raised the question of the propriety of Mr. Lindberg
                            continuing what has been the regular practice of reporting monthly to
                            the Secretary of State on funds handled by the Collector General of
                            Customs (see despatches of February 20, May 24, June 8, June 26, and
                            July 17, 1934<note n="4" xml:id="d572fn4">None printed.</note>). Mr.
                            Lindberg replied to the effect that in view of there being American
                            bondholders interested in the revenues of the Nicaraguan Government, he
                            considered it logical to furnish a copy of the report to the Secretary
                            of State. There would seem to be, however, no good reason for reports to
                            be sent to the Secretary of State of the United States, unless they are
                            also sent to corresponding officials in the other countries of which the
                            bondholders are nationals. I so expressed myself to Mr. Lindberg.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Lindberg said that, unless the Department should request copies of
                            the regular reports, he will refrain from submitting them in future.
                            While it may be true that the reports which have been customarily
                            submitted by Mr. Lindberg’s office in the past contain information of
                            value to the Department, I consider that the principle involved, to
                            which I have made reference, is important enough to outweigh the
                            disadvantage of not having such prompt information regarding the
                            revenues of the Nicaraguan Government.</p>
                        <p>Because of the general attitude prevailing towards foreigners now in the
                            employ of the Government of Nicaragua, as outlined in my confidential
                            despatch No. 325 of July 13, 1934,<note n="5" xml:id="d572fn5">Not
                                printed.</note> I consider that the Legation must exercise great
                            care in order that its relations with such officials be not
                            misinterpreted.</p>
                        <p>I should be grateful if the Department would indicate whether my action
                            meets with the Department’s approval.</p>

                            Finance of Nicaragua, Doctor Salvador Guerrero Montalván, while in the
                            United States, addressed two memoranda to the Department, designated A
                            and B, the first expressing the ideas of the Government of Nicaragua
                            with regard to the possible conclusion of agreements intended to
                            stimulate commerce between Nicaragua and the United States, and the
                            second expressing the proposal of the Government of Nicaragua to reduce
                            the expenditures of certain Nicaraguan institutions, including the
                            Guardia Nacional, and the Customs Collectorship.</p>
                        <p>The Department acknowledged the receipt of these memoranda on November
                            25, 1933, and thereafter made an exhaustive study of the various loan
                            contracts, financial plans, et cetera, of Nicaragua, under which the
                            United States in the past had occupied a special relationship toward
                            that country. As a result of this study it was determined that whatever
                            special relationship had existed between the two countries in the past,
                            by reason of these contracts or financial plans, no longer exists. The
                            Department has, therefore, addressed the following note to the Chargé
                            d’Affaires of Nicaragua, dated today: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            the matters covered therein have been the subject of an extensive
                            examination in the Department, and the conclusion has been reached that

                            law under which Mr. Lindberg could be required to furnish to the
                            Secretary of State either the annual report or the monthly reports on
                            funds handled by the Collector General of Customs. This conclusion seems
                            inevitable since this Government is not a party to any of the agreements
                            or contracts under which these reports were made, and there is, of
                            course, no question of intervention at this time by reason of which the
                            filing of these reports with the Secretary of State could be
                            required.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing, I concur in your recommendation that as a
                            matter of policy it would be unwise to forward the reports in question
                            to the Secretary of State as this might give a false impression
                            concerning the attitude of the United States with respect to the
                            Government of Nicaragua. You are authorized to inform Mr. Lindberg of
                            the substance of this instruction.</p>

                                month of October 1933, certain pending questions between the United
                                States and the Republic of Panama were mutually and satisfactorily
                                settled. Other questions which were brought up were left open with
                                the idea of settling them at the earliest opportunity. The spirit in

                                matters have been approached can best be rendered by referring to
                                one of the general declarations, which recognized that the Republic
                                of Panama as a sovereign nation had the right to benefit from the
                                commercial advantages derived from its geographical situation to the
                                extent that it does not interfere with the maintenance, functioning,
                                sanitation and protection of the Canal by the United States, who
                                desire ardently the prosperity of the Republic of Panama.</p>
                            <p>The pending questions and the aspirations of Panama are as
                                follows:</p>

                                wireless stations in Panamanian territory.</p>
                            <p>The position of the Republic of Panama in the matter of wireless
                                communications is therefore extremely awkward. The Republic is a

                                subject President Roosevelt told President Arias: “The United States

                                question and to find a way to comply with Panama’s desire.”</p>

                                protection of his business, while the Panama Railroad Co. which does
                                business on a scale which offers no comparison with the above
                                mentioned case is exempt from all taxation.</p>

                                one. Presumably this matter will be resolved in accordance with the

                            points respectfully submitted in memorandum I had the honor of tendering

                            for solution; among them, however, a few stand that, by their very
                            nature and scope on the good and friendly relations between our two
                            countries, seem to deserve an immediate and attentive consideration.
                            These are, by instance, that of radio communication, the Panama Rail
                            Road Company commercial activities and the building of a trans-Isthmian
                            highway.</p>
                        <p>In connection to the first point, i. e., radio communication, Panama
                            is—as I personally pointed to you—in a quite embarrassing and
                            disgraceful situation. It is the matter of a modern system which every
                            country in the world is freely enjoying, while we, Panamanians, are not
                            using it for our own convenience due to the interference against such
                            use as exerted by the Navy Department of the United States, which action
                            seems not justified at all. As you may readily understand it, the
                            circumstance of the Panama Canal being located on our own territory
                            appears not to justify the fact that our entire population is being
                            deprived of the benefits of an invention used at their own discretion by
                            every nation the world over. Panama, wholly acquainted with the
                            circumstances and ensuing responsibilities, is ready to cooperate with
                            the United States of America in the protection and defense of the Panama
                            Canal; but it should appear unjust to carry out such a desire of
                            cooperation to the extreme point of depriving ourselves of wireless
                            communication with the world, a part of which we are. It is well
                            possible, I think, for our two governments—yours and mine—to arrive to a
                            mutual understanding and agreement on this point on the terms of the
                            Washington Wireless Convention as signed by both the Republic of Panama
                            and the United States.</p>
                        <p>Another point at issue and pending solution is that of the commercial
                            activities carried on by the Panama Rail Road Company. This concern, the
                            entire stock of which belongs to the United States Government, exerts
                            itself varied commercial activities in our country, and some of such
                            activities bear no apparent connection with passengers and cargo
                            transportation through the Isthmus of Panama, this having been the aim
                            in constituting the Company as an auxiliary to the Panama Canal and this
                            being its true character as of lately. Most of such commercial
                            activities exerted on territories under Panamanian jurisdiction, are
                            under shelter and protection by Panamanian laws and authorities, and the
                            Panama Government gets no payment or compensation for services, as the
                            only reward it was getting in exchange for its very liberal concessions
                            was annulled since the Canal Treaty started to be in force. It is
                            apparent, then, that the Panama Rail Road Company, a concern worth
                            millions of dollars and doing varied profitable business under
                            protection and shelter dispensed by Panama laws and authorities, pays
                            nothing for such protection, not even the compulsory compensation paid
                            by every Panamanian citizen, from the <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586"
                                facs="0652"/>richest to the most humble classes. It appears markedly
                            unjust that, by instance, while a poor man peddling fruits in the
                            streets of Panama and Colón is forced to pay a tax in compensation for
                            the protection he enjoys from Panamanian laws and administration, the
                            Panama Rail Road Company is getting free and gratis the same protection
                            for its bulky and valuable business. It is, at least, not easy at all to
                            make this difference understood by the Panamanian people.</p>
                        <p>As for the third point, that one concerning the trans-Isthmian highway,
                            we have it as a growing necessity for the development of our cities, and
                            undelayable in order that the inhabitants of the city of Colon may enjoy
                            the use of modern roads built on the Pacific side by the Panama
                            Government at a high cost partly paid with funds raised through taxing
                            the Colonites. It seems to be unjust that the inhabitants of the
                            Republic’s Atlantic section, having contributed to the construction of
                            such roads, may not be able to use them for their own benefit because of
                            a privilege granted more than fifty years ago by the Colombian
                            Government to the Panama Rail Road Company. It is most probable that the
                            taking into consideration the growing necessity of communications that
                            modern ages ask for, was the reason why in the Canal Treaty draft
                            (section V) the monopoly granted by it to the United States for
                            inter-oceanic communication was limited to “any system of communication
                            by the Canal or the rail-road” and nothing was said anent highways. The
                            trans-Isthmian highway will, besides open a large field of activity for
                            many a workingman now idle for lack of employment. The United States
                            have already expressed, in principle, their approval of the Panama
                            planning to build the interoceanic highway, and only their formal
                            consent is now needed to get the work started.</p>
                        <p>Allow me then, Mr. Secretary, to point out the convenience of giving
                            preference, if possible, when taking into consideration the matters
                            included in my Montevideo memorandum, to the points I am treating in
                            this letter, in the certitude that such an action will greatly enhance a

                        <p>The Minister of Panama presents his compliments to His Excellency the
                            Secretary of State of the United States and in accordance with special
                            instructions which he has received from his Government has the honor to
                            make the following statement: <list>

                                <item>In November 1927, Panama and the United States signed and
                                    later ratified the Washington International Radiotelegraph
                                    Convention. This pact governs the relations of the two countries
                                    in this matter and establishes that they can enter into special
                                    agreements in conformity with their mutual interests. Panama has
                                    repeatedly manifested its disposition to give the United States
                                    all the reasonable cooperation which may be required for the
                                    operation and protection of the Canal, but on condition that its
                                    rights as a sovereign and independent nation be respected.
                                    Notwithstanding this situation, the United States without
                                    Panama’s knowledge and consent has performed acts whereby it
                                    purposes to assume control over wireless communications in the
                                    territory of the Republic, thus disregarding its sovereignty,
                                    which has given rise to a formal protest on its part to the
                                    Department of State.</item>

                                <item>The Navy Department has been exercising in fact, in pursuance
                                    of this attitude of the United States Government, a certain
                                    control over radiotelegraph communications in the Republic,
                                    particularly so far as concerns the reception and transmission
                                    of messages for ships on the high seas. The aforesaid Navy
                                    Department requires that no station installed in the Republic
                                    shall receive or transmit messages from or to ships, so that, as
                                    a consequence, the radiotelegraph stations of the United States
                                    Navy situated in the Canal Zone have virtually a monopoly of
                                    such communications.</item>

                                <item>It should be observed in this connection that the United
                                    States Government has never tried to establish such control over
                                    the radiotelegraph stations established in the United States in
                                    the vicinity of its fortified ports. The stations which are
                                    situated in New York, Norfolk, San Diego, San Francisco, etc.,
                                    may transmit and receive freely, in peace time, messages for
                                    ships, in spite of the fact that they are in the vicinity of
                                    fortified places.</item>

                                <item>Attention should be called also to the fact that even if the
                                    measures suggested by the Navy Department were put into force,
                                    they <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0654"/>would not have a
                                    practical result, since the stations established in the Republic
                                    of Panama could transmit and receive messages to and from the
                                    ships through other stations situated, for example in Costa
                                    Rica, at a distance of some one hundred and fifty miles from the
                                    Canal.</item>
                                <label>5.</label>
                                <item>At the request of the State Department the President of Panama
                                    in October 1933, in the White House, explained the said facts
                                    and circumstances to Captain Hooper, an expert in radio matters
                                    in the service of the Navy Department. The conference was held
                                    in the presence of Mr. Edwin C. Wilson, Chief of the Latin
                                    American Division of the Department of State. After Mr. Hooper’s
                                    arguments were overcome by the explanations given above, the
                                    latter adduced as a fundamental reason for recommending to the
                                    Navy Department that it should assume the aforementioned
                                    attitude, that it was indispensable in his judgment for the
                                    officers of the United States Navy to have the opportunity to
                                    train themselves properly in everything relating to the
                                    transmission, receiving and delivery of commercial messages. But
                                    he could find no reply when he was reminded that it was easier
                                    and more appropriate to obtain such training for the naval
                                    officers in the ports of New York, San Diego, etc., which are
                                    under the sovereignty of the United States, and nevertheless,
                                    the same procedure is not followed in the said ports as it is
                                    desired to follow with the Republic of Panama.</item>

                                            present Aviation Board. This Board would have, say, six

                                            by the United States Government, for appointment by the
                                            President of Panama. This Board would issue regulations
                                            for the licensing, inspection, etc., of radio stations
                                            in the Republic of Panama. Appropriate measures would be

                                            American companies, and for appropriate safeguarding
                                            provisions to prevent endangering the operation or
                                            defense of the Canal Zone. The United States, under such
                                            conditions, would agree that no special restrictions be

                            removal of zone restrictions against entry of deported Panamanians,

                        <p>Your July 23, 3 p.m. No decision reached with President Arias. I made
                            suggestion that no private radio company engage in ship to shore service
                            but that we would gladly give further study with Panama to possibility
                            of the Panaman Government setting up their own ship to shore service
                            with some United States Navy personnel in constant contact with such
                            service and continuous access to all messages.</p>
                        <p>As to commissaries there should be no elimination of our service to ships
                            but it should be limited to ship’s stores and not include luxuries. The
                            Canal Zone Governor is, I gather, ready to give equal opportunity to a
                            representative of Panama merchants to board all ships at the same time
                            as his man does so, and to sell their wares in competition with Canal
                            Zone commissary.</p>
                        <p>I suggest you resume conversations and hold final decision till my
                            return.</p>

                                <p>That he is unwilling to request such further extension of United

                                    Cristobal. He therefore desires that this question be dropped.
                                    He said, however, that if it is seriously considered that the
                                    American residents of New Cristobal suffer from inadequate
                                    police and fire protection, some agreement may be negotiated
                                    with Panama whereby additional police and fire protection in New
                                    Cristobal might be furnished by American personnel from the

                                    lands owned by them in Colon and Panama not required by the
                                    activities of the Canal and the Railroad Company; and that this
                                    policy be made known as a portion of the pertinent agreements

                        <p>By authorization of President Roosevelt it is desired to record in this
                            memorandum that his understanding of the views exchanged between
                            President Arias and himself in October, 1933, in so far as they related
                            to any question affecting the “construction” of the Panama Canal, and
                            his understanding of the phraseology employed in the Joint Statement of
                            the two Presidents of October 17, 1933,<note n="15" xml:id="d585fn15"
                                >Department of State, <hi rend="italic">Press Releases</hi>, October
                                21, 1933, p. 218.</note> in relation to this matter, is that such
                            views and such phraseology referred to the Canal as having been
                            “constructed” in the obvious sense that the principal stage of
                            construction has been completed and that the Canal is now open to use.
                            It has always been manifest, however, in President Roosevelt’s opinion,
                            that in a project as vast as that of the Panama Canal, there will
                            probably be required from time to time expansion of Canal facilities,
                            including additional construction, in order to insure adequate water
                            supply and adequate facilities for expected increase in traffic.
                            Obviously, the exact extent of such future expansion cannot be foreseen
                            at the present time. Conversely, if future developments should appear to
                            render unnecessary the retention for Canal purposes of any land or water
                            facilities then enjoyed by the United States, the United States would
                            expect to relinquish such facilities to Panama.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, in the interest of Panama as well as in the interest of
                            the United States that as potential traffic through the Canal increases,
                            adequate facilities be provided so that such traffic may not be diverted
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>It is because of the foregoing considerations, which it is believed will
                            be readily understood by the Government of Panama, that the United
                            States Government is unable to renounce any of the rights which it
                            enjoys under Article II of the treaty of November 18, 1903.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Minister</hi>: I understand that when
                            leaving the Department yesterday, you requested a repetition of some of
                            the remarks I had made at the opening of our conversation yesterday. I
                            am very glad to repeat these statements in this personal letter to
                            you.</p>
                        <p>I stated that I was glad to be able to say that this Government was now
                            in a position to offer to the Government of Panama a basis for agreement
                            on all of the questions which have given rise to misunderstanding during
                            the past years which I believed would be agreeable to your Government;
                            that this basis entailed an arrangement which would give to Panama all
                            that to which in equity Panama was justly entitled and reserve to the
                            United States all those rights believed indispensable in relation to the
                            defense, maintenance, construction, operation, and sanitation, of the
                            Panama Canal. I likewise added that I was sure you would understand that
                            the draft I handed you<note n="16" xml:id="d586fn16">Not printed.</note>
                            was not transmitted as a bargaining proposal, but as a suggested
                            agreement based, after much study and consideration, upon the foundation
                            above described. Finally, I said that in the judgment of this
                            Government, all of our proposals and all of the series of agreements
                            suggested should be regarded as an entity to stand or fall together and
                            not as separate and unrelated instruments some of which might be
                            accepted and others rejected.</p>
                        <p>I trust that this letter conveys the information you desired. If not,
                            please let me know and I shall, of course, be happy to repeat any
                            further remarks I may have made during the course of our most agreeable
                            conference.</p>

                            Panama for the purpose of removing all those differences and causes of

                            countries as a result of the construction and operation of the Panama

                        <p>The Minister of Panama has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the
                            State Department’s memorandum of October 30, last, which treats of the
                            proposal made by the Panamanian Government that in the new treaty which
                            it is intended to conclude the statement be made that Panama has already
                            fulfilled the obligation of granting the use, occupation and control of
                            all the lands and waters outside of the Canal Zone which might be
                            necessary for the construction of the Canal and that, consequently, the
                            obligation which she assumed by the Treaty of 1903 of granting the use,
                            occupation and control of the said additional lands and waters has been
                            extinguished.</p>
                        <p>In relation to this subject the Department of State transcribes the
                            paragraphs marked 1 and 2 which are found at page 48 of the Message sent
                            by the President of Panama to the National Assembly on the first of
                            September, last, in which paragraphs, referring to the results of his
                            interview with the President of the United States, President Arias
                            expresses the idea that, as a result of the interview, it was
                            established that the provisions of the treaty concluded in 1903 “no
                            longer contemplate the use, occupation and control of the Canal Zone for
                            purposes of construction”.</p>
                        <p>My Government believes that that view is most strictly in accord with the
                            terms of paragraph one of the joint statement made by the Presidents of
                            Panama and of the United States on the 17th of October, 1933, which
                            paragraph reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p rend="flushleft">“Now that the Panama canal has been constructed,
                                    the provisions of the Treaty of 1903 between the United States
                                    and Panama contemplates <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0663"
                                    />the use, occupation and control by the United States of the
                                    anal Zone for the purpose of the maintenance, operation,
                                    sanitation and protection of the Canal.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>As may be seen, the paragraph transcribed expresses the understanding
                            that the Canal having already been constructed, the provisions of the
                            Canal treaty contemplate the use, occupation and control of the Zone
                            “for the purpose of the maintenance, operation, sanitation and
                            protection of the Canal”. As the term “construction” has not been used
                            either in this paragraph nor in the following one, my Government has
                            deduced from this clear language that it was evident and agreed upon
                            that the provisions of the 1903 treaty do not and cannot contemplate the
                            construction of a canal which has already been constructed.</p>
                        <p>My Government believes, further, that the United States Government stated
                            more than twelve years ago that the construction period of the Canal has
                            already passed and that such period came to an end with the formal
                            opening of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, when the abrogation of the Taft Agreement was effected,<note

                            precise reason given to justify that step, namely, that the construction

                        <p>The same Executive Order, in referring to the Taft Agreement in its
                            second “whereas” calls it an “agreement reached between the Secretary of
                            War and officials of the Panama Government to serve as a <hi

                            canal”.</p>
                        <p>The Department expresses the view that when it was said in the joint
                            declaration that the Canal is already constructed the statement was made
                            “in the obvious sense that the principal stage of construction has been
                            completed and that the Canal is now open to use”, but it is considered,
                            nevertheless, that “in a project as vast as that of the Panama Canal,
                            there will probably be required from time to time expansion of Canal
                            facilities, including additional construction, in order to insure
                            adequate water supply and adequate facilities for expected increase in
                            traffic. Obviously, the exact extent of such future expansion cannot be
                            foreseen at the present time”.</p>
                        <p>The memorandum states, for these considerations, that the Government of
                            the United States is unable to renounce any of the rights granted to it
                            by Article II of the Treaty of 1903.</p>
                        <p>The Government of Panama deeply regrets that it cannot agree with this
                            interpretation of Article II, just referred to, because of the foregoing
                            considerations and the considerations set forth below which support its
                            point of view on the matter.</p>
                        <p>When the Treaty of November 18, 1903, was concluded, the question had not
                            yet been settled as to what type of maritime channel—a sea-level canal
                            or a lock canal—the United States would construct and of course the
                            possibility was foreseen that a lock canal might be constructed which
                            would require the creation of artificial lakes, the area of which would
                            necessarily have to extend beyond the strip ten miles wide, the use,
                            occupation and control of which were granted for the canal proper.
                            Therefore, Article II of the treaty provided in the second sentence of
                            its first paragraph, as follows: <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0665"/>

                        <p>If a glance is cast on the map of the Canal Zone it will be easily seen
                            that all the waters that flow toward the Canal have already been made
                            use of and continue to be made use of for feeding the locks and that the
                            lakes of Gatún and Mireflores receive the waters from the various
                            rivers, small rivers, arroyos and other streams forming the river
                            systems of the Gatún, Siricito, Agua Sucia, Siri Grande, Trinidad,
                            Tripones, Caño Quebrado, Pescado, Paja, Bailamonos, Mandinga, Cocoli,
                            Cardenas and Caimitillo Rivers; of the Chagres River, with its principal
                            tributaries, the Chilibre, the Chilibrillo, the Indio, the Pequeñi, the
                            Gatúncillo and in short all the other streams found on the various
                            slopes that descend toward the Canal. The Chagres River not only feeds
                            Gatún Lake but also the Lake of Alhajuela, formed by means of the Madden
                            Dam, at a level higher than that of Gatún Lake. It seems evident,
                            therefore, that there is no longer any system or utilizable stream of
                            water for the Canal that has not already been utilized and which is not
                            being utilized and neither is there any area of land that could be
                            utilized for the formation of other artificial lakes, inasmuch as the
                            three now in existence receive and store all the waters that flow over
                            the slopes running toward the Canal basin. <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600"
                                facs="0666"/>It must be taken into account, furthermore, that the
                            supply of water for the locks has as a basis today a level in Gatún Lake
                            of eightyseven feet above sea level and that the Republic of Panama has
                            granted to the United States the use, occupation and control of the
                            lands necessary for the elevation of the waters of the said Gatún Lake
                            to the height of one hundred feet above sea level. This elevation,
                            combined with the storage of water in the Lake of Alhajuela is
                            sufficiently above the requirements of the Canal not merely with the two
                            sets of locks now in existence but also with a third set of locks that
                            may be constructed and put in use in the future for a traffic four or
                            five times greater than that which at present exists.</p>
                        <p>When the possible enlargement of the facilities of the Canal has been
                            spoken of the reference has always been specifically to the construction
                            of additional locks, which signifies constructions that must be made
                            within the Canal Zone and not outside of it. “As the Canal throughout
                            its length of fifty miles,”—General Harry Burgess, Governor of the
                            Canal, has said—”has a channel sufficiently wide for ships to be able to
                            pass each other, no limitation whatever so far as concerns the channel
                            of the Canal need be considered. The limiting factor lies in the locks.”
                            Accordingly, the only thing that can be needed outside the Canal Zone is
                            the use and the supply of water which, as has been explained, has
                            already been granted, accepted and utilized. By the land and water
                            utilized for such object, the Canal traffic is rendered secure not only
                            in its present capacity but in the capacity to which it may attain in
                            all the period up to the year 2000.</p>
                        <p>This is shown by the extremely conservative technical calculations made
                            by the eminent engineer General Harry Burgess, Governor of the Panama
                            Canal until the middle of 1932. From a study published by him in the
                            magazine <hi rend="italic">The Military Engineer</hi>, of
                            September–October, 1929, we take the following passages: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The combined supply from the two lakes (Gatún and Alhajuela)
                                    would be, in a dry season like that of 1920, 49,000,000,000
                                    cubic feet. For an impounding of water at the height of 240
                                    feet, the combined supply would amount to 53,000,000,000 cubic
                                    feet” … “Supposing Lake Alhajuela to have an elevation of 230
                                    feet, the supply of water would be sufficient for fifty-six
                                    daily transits through the locks and if the elevation of the dam
                                    were 240 feet, the supply of water would be sufficient for sixty
                                    daily transits. It is apparent, therefore, that when the
                                    Alhajuela project is finished, the provision of water for the
                                    Canal will be sufficient to operate the three sets of locks to
                                    the limit of their practical capacity.”<note n="*"

                            elevation of 263 feet above the same level; (Report of the Governor of

                            through the Gatún locks during the year 1928 was 16.7 daily. The average
                            for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1933, was 12.0 for the same locks
                            and in the preceding fiscal years it was 17.23 in 1929, 16.81 for 1930,

                                    Canal (General Walker) of the statistics of Suez and Panama and
                                    the increase in world trade, led him to the conclusion that the

                            it is given to the present generation to foresee. This authority beyond

                            foreseeable future any possibility of extension of the Canal facilities
                            involving a necessity for new land and water outside the Zone.</p>
                        <p>Panama considers, therefore, that there is no reason justifying the
                            retention of an indeterminate, indefinite, unlimited and eternal clause,
                            the retention of which affects its national prestige; which is a latent
                            subject of alarm for all the citizens and inhabitants of the Republic
                            who see following it the specter of sudden and unnecessary
                            expropriations, and which therefore constitutes an obstacle to the free
                            economic development of the country.</p>
                        <p>My Government cannot believe that the additional lands clause had the
                            scope or purpose of creating a kind of international eminent domain of
                            perpetual duration, but merely the purpose of granting in an
                            indeterminate form a right, the extension of which could only be
                            determined when the execution of the work which would permit us to know,
                            as we now know, the factor unknown in 1903, of the lands and waters
                            necessary for the construction and operation of a lock Canal.
                            Interpreted in that manner, the clause would come to form a kind of <hi
                                rend="italic">capitis diminutio</hi> of the national sovereignty,
                            which would not permit the Republic of Panama to esteem itself the real
                            sovereign of its territory, the latter being subject to an unlimited and
                            unrestricted encumbrance which would affect its whole area, from one
                            border to the other.</p>
                        <p>What in 1903 was possible of explanation, in 1934 can have no
                            justification. Panama’s sacrifices on behalf of the work on the Canal
                            must have some limit. It could agree to the very burdensome and
                            exceptional concessions which were imposed in 1903 by the force of
                            insuperable circumstances. But Panama cannot agree to the perpetuation
                            of a clause that inflicts upon it moral and material damage, without
                            giving the United States any real equivalent benefit, because it retains
                            the right to require that which there is no longer any need to
                            require.</p>
                        <p>In view of the foregoing considerations, the Government of Panama hopes
                            that the enlightened Government of the United States will see fit to
                            reconsider what was stated in the memorandum of October 30, last, in the
                            sense that there may be included in the new treaty that is contemplated,
                            a clause containing in substance the declaration and agreement suggested
                            in the draft article that the undersigned Minister had the honor to

                            employees is effected: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                <p>“The Panama Canal is still without arrangements enabling it to
                                    give due assistance to its foreign employees who, by reason of
                                    advanced age or other physical incapacity, can no longer perform
                                    their duties properly and must be separated from the working
                                    personnel.</p>
                                <p>“To such employees of the Railway Company pensions varying from
                                    $7 to $30 a month are given, but there is no authority for doing
                                    the same for the employees of the Panama Canal. The only thing
                                    that can be done for them at present is to offer them quarters
                                    in the Corozal Hospital, where there are no accommodations for
                                    their families, or to keep them on the pay roll at reduced
                                    wages, at pay varying from $15 to $35 a month, in order that
                                    they may do such work as they can. It would be much better to
                                    pension them once for all and thus permit them to be separated
                                    from the active work of the Canal.</p>
                                <p>“In order to obtain some relief, the sum of $10,000 was included
                                    in the 1933 estimates, for the payment in cash of remunerations
                                    not exceeding $30 per month to incapacitated foreign employees,
                                    under the rules that the President may issue. This was rejected
                                    by the Bureau of the Budget, because it constituted new
                                    legislation. It is hoped that a separate bill on the matter will
                                    be introduced. The need for aid in this regard is urgent, not
                                    only as a question of humane treatment of the employees who have
                                    reached an advanced age, but also as a measure of efficiency in
                                    the work.</p>
                                <p>“The cost of assistance to these employees, on the basis of an
                                    average pension of $20 per month, has been estimated by the
                                    Bureau of Efficiency as $12,000 for the first year, with a
                                    gradual increase up to a maximum of $121,000 per annum for the

                            in question, says the following, under the heading “Foreign Employees of

                                    lump sums of from $25 to $500 have been paid to 14 of those

                            itself agrees that, with respect to retirement pay, there should be a
                            plan which provides it not only for the Panamanian citizens employed on
                            the Canal, but also for all foreign employees. The Panamanian proposal
                            therefore is based on justice, humanity and also the benefits to the

                            Executive Order of December 23, 1908, and the subsequent orders, the
                            establishment of such equality would not actually make any great
                            difference, because of the very small number of Panamanian employees of

                                <p>“In January, 1934, there were 11,526 employees on the Panama

                                    them 2,853 were American citizens, while 8,673 were foreigners.
                                    The foreign employees are, as has been said, in the majority,

                                    Barbados. Comparatively few of the foreign employees are from

                        <p>The number of the Panamanian employees on the gold roll at present is,

                            any reason whatever for refusing to these employees, the majority of
                            whom earn small salaries, the same rights and facilities as are granted
                            to American citizens in the matters in which inequalities exist
                            today.</p>
                        <p>With respect to employees on the silver roll and the laborers, the total
                            number on June 21, 1933, was 9,575. The Legation does not have exact
                            numerical data regarding the number of such employees who were
                            Panamanian citizens, but according to data for the year 1932, the
                            situation was as follows: <table rows="2" cols="2"

                        <p rend="flushleft">were Panamanians, that is, the proportion was hardly 20

                            as has been said, are almost all West Indians, only one is a
                            Panamanian.</p>
                        <p>This want of proportion has, apparently, not undergone any noticeable
                            change. The Panamanian Commission considers that the most elementary
                            sense of justice requires that after the great sacrifices made by Panama
                            for the work of the Canal, Panamanian citizens may be able to obtain a
                            larger proportion of the benefits furnished by the opportunity to work
                            on the Canal works; and it would therefore be very desirable that by
                            establishing firmly and effectively the preference of Panamanian
                            citizens over foreigners with respect to eligibility, promotion and
                            reduction of force, the distressing situation which Panamanian artisans
                            and day workers are now experiencing with respect to the work offered by
                            the Canal and the Railway may be corrected.</p>
                        <p>A very clear idea of this situation is given by the following words of
                            the Governor of the Canal Zone, in his report for the year 1932: <quote

                                    the completion of the construction work, the United States

                                    to the interior has resulted in a movement from the country to
                                    the city rather than from the city to the land. A further factor
                                    has been the natural growth of population in a prolific people,
                                    without control and without the losses from disease which
                                    occurred prior to the era of American sanitation. Similarly, but
                                    to a less extent numerically, the American population in the
                                    Canal Zone has increased, and many young men and women of the
                                    Canal families are approaching maturity without employment. The
                                    search for work is sharp and there is an increasing competition
                                    between Americans and aliens for work that may be performed
                                    almost equally well by either.</p>
                                <p>“This situation has become acute with the general slump in
                                    business, the falling off in Canal traffic and related
                                    activities and the diminished appropriations for new
                                    construction and replacements. It is not practicable to care for
                                    any number of these people by allowing them to settle on land in
                                    the Canal Zone. Many could not make a living for the moment, and
                                    the increases of malarial infection that have resulted in the
                                    Canal towns from the presence of these settlers have led us to
                                    the decision to license no more settlers. The most obvious form
                                    of relief is an increase in public works.”</p>

                        <p>Although the situation is perhaps not as acute today as two years ago, it
                            continues to be bad enough so that the Panamanian Commission, in view of

                            by the Panama Canal and the Panama Railroad Company. The memorandum
                            notes that at present there is no difference in treatment on the ground
                            of nationality with reference to eligibility, pay, protection against
                            accident in line of duty, and general working conditions. It points out,
                            however. <pb n="609" xml:id="pg_609" facs="0675"/>the difference in
                            treatment on the ground of nationality with respect to promotions,
                            vacations for the employees on the silver roll, retirement and reduction
                            of personnel; on this latter point, however, it might be noted that
                            existing executive orders provide for preference of Panamanians over
                            foreigners in case of such reduction.</p>
                        <p>At such time in our discussions with the Panamanian Commissioners as you
                            find it desirable to explain to them the reasons why we are unable to
                            accept their draft article on this subject, I suggest that you might
                            inform them of our interest in the question and willingness to take up

                            could cooperate with the War Department in supporting legislation for
                            the payment of old age pensions to foreign employees of the Panama

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that at an
                            informal interview had today with the Secretary of Foreign Relations he
                            voluntarily spoke regarding the progress of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>He stated that conversations were continuing on more or less minor
                            matters in Washington, but that the objection made by the Panamanian
                            Government as to the provisions of Article II of the Treaty of 1903
                            being inserted into the new treaty seemed to be meeting with obstacles.
                            He said that Panama felt it had already complied with that provision of
                            the treaty and that it was no longer necessary to incorporate it in any
                            new treaty and that that was holding up further progress. That the same
                            question had been raised by Mr. Louis Anderson, an international lawyer
                            of Costa Rica, in connection with the boundary matter upon the ground
                            that since the United States could take over any land which it might
                            require in defense of the Canal, that under those conditions Costa Rica
                            could not accept any land from the Republic of Panama in the settlement
                            of its boundary dispute as it was not free to dispose of any land, which
                            was at all times subject to be requisitioned by the United States
                            Government. For this reason, the boundary conversations with Costa Rica
                            had come to a sudden termination instead of, as expected, being adjusted
                            and settled. Under the circumstances the Foreign Secretary stated that
                            unless the United States was willing, particularly in time of peace, to
                                <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0676"/>refrain from taking over
                            any further land of the Republic of Panama that that in itself would
                            prevent the negotiation of a new treaty.</p>
                        <p>Further, that as a condition for the construction of the transisthmian
                            road, the United States had suggested that it be permitted to erect
                            along said road any and all fortifications and gun emplacements which it
                            deemed necessary and that, regardless of the fact that Panama was
                            anxious to build this road, it could not be considered if it was to be a
                            military area, particularly that portion of the road located within the
                            territory of Panama. Furthermore, the Secretary stated, that the
                            conditions as to construction of this road were so severe in character
                            that it would necessitate a $3,000,000. investment on the part of Panama
                            which it could not afford and, in conclusion, since the main benefit of
                            this road would enure to the United States and not to the Panamanian
                            people, that if such provisions were to be insisted upon, Panama would
                            abandon the idea of constructing the trans-isthmian road.</p>
                        <p>He further stated in conclusion that if the United States insisted on its
                            right to take over further property of Panama that he presumed that the
                            ultimate conclusion would be to withdraw the commission and continue
                            under the old treaty until such time as other arrangements might be
                            made. He informed me further that regarding the Madden Dam road, that it
                            has been tentatively agreed that the Republic of Panama would turn over
                            to the United States the jurisdiction thereof in exchange for permission
                            to build the trans-isthmian road but that the conditions above mentioned
                            made that impossible.</p>
                        <p>He further stated that in connection with the matter of radio, that
                            regardless of the fact of whether the United States made a radio
                            agreement or not the Panamanian Government intended to proceed with
                            radio broadcasting under its recent laws, and the Madrid Convention<note

                            States.</p>
                        <p>It is quite apparent, insofar as the Panamanian Government is concerned,
                            that they do not seem to be willing to grant any rights to the United
                            States, whether they relate to the maintenance, operation and/or defense
                            of the Canal or not, and that their sole theory is based upon the fact
                            that it has already turned over to the United States all the land and
                            waters which the United States required for the defense of the
                            Canal.</p>
                        <p>I inquired from him as to what was the objection of Panama for the United
                            States having whatever land was necessary for the proper defense of the
                            Canal, and his reply was that without any limitation being made the
                            people of Panama were of the opinion that under an unlimited provision
                            as to further acquisition of land the United <pb n="611" xml:id="pg_611"
                                facs="0677"/>States might be able some day to extend its
                            jurisdiction even to the Costa Rican border.</p>
                        <p>This afternoon I interviewed the President for the purpose of inquiring
                            from him whether or not in his opinion he believed that a treaty which
                            might be agreed upon in Washington and presented to the National
                            Assembly could be passed. He stated that in his selection of Dr. López
                            and Dr. Garay he had two views in mind, one, to obtain a representative
                            of the Chiarista Party by the appointment of Dr. López and, secondly,
                            from the Panamanian Society of International Action in the person of Dr.
                            Garay, and that if they agreed in Washington to terms for a new treaty
                            that he was positive that the Assembly would ratify it. On the other
                            hand, he stated that there had been some delay caused in the
                            conversations in Washington, first, owing to the fact that Dr. Garay had
                            been ill and then Mr. Edwin Wilson having become ill, as well as the
                            Christmas holidays, all of which had slowed up conversations.</p>
                        <p>However, the question of incorporating in the new treaty the provisions
                            contained in Article II of the Treaty of 1903 was objectionable, and
                            that unless the Government of the United States would be willing to
                            eliminate that provision, Panama would be unable to continue
                            conversations as to any new treaty; that as yet his Government had not
                            received definite advice on this question from the State Department. His
                            commissioners in Washington had written for further instructions as to
                            whether or not they should remain any longer in Washington, and he had
                            advised them that they should remain until the end of January before
                            returning.</p>
                        <p>This information seems to be in accord with what is heretofore reported
                            as to the conversation with the Secretary of Foreign Relations.</p>
                        <p>The President then stated that in addition to the objection on the part
                            of his Government, to the subject matter of Article II of the treaty of
                            1903, that Louis Anderson, international lawyer in Costa Rica, was
                            making much to do over the question of whether or not Panama was able to
                            cede any land to Costa Rica in the boundary dispute, because the United
                            States, under Article II, would be able to follow the land and claim it,
                            which the President stated was of course an exaggerated view but,
                            however, had been made authentic enough in Costa Rica to bring about the
                            secession [<hi rend="italic">cessation?</hi>] of all further
                            conversation regarding the determination of the boundary.</p>
                        <p>I inquired of the President as to his opinion concerning the pending
                            banking bill. He stated that it was his understanding that when the
                            original bill was presented to Mr. Manuel José Diez, of the Chase
                            National Bank, that he made no objection to it, but that he, the
                            President, understood that the amendments which had since been made by
                                <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0678"/>the Assembly had changed
                            the complexion of the bill; that the bill was coming up today for second
                            debate in the National Assembly and for further amendments and that he
                            as yet was not familiar with the context of the bill.</p>
                        <p>In speaking of the free port bill, the President stated that he intended
                            to circularize the advantages of that bill among the exporters of the
                            United States through the medium of his consuls, since he believed that
                            sufficient advantages would be found for exporters under it and he
                            wanted to have them fully advised through the medium of his consuls, who
                            would be supplied with copies of the bill.</p>
                        <p>He also stated, in referring to the Blandin rubber contract, that he
                            believed that contract would not only be beneficial to his people, since
                            it would give rise to employment and to a product of exportation, but
                            also to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company who, in time of war, would
                            have a plantation accessible to the United States for its needs and that
                            he was ready to re-execute the contract as amended just as soon as a
                            representative of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company would come to
                            Panama.</p>

                            President Arias stated that the first night at the White House he had
                            mentioned the matter and had asked that payment be made on a gold basis.
                            At this point Dr. Alfaro read me a letter he had received from President
                            Arias in which the latter stated that President Roosevelt had answered,
                            in effect, that there would be no question of making the payment on a
                            good [<hi rend="italic">gold?</hi>] basis, because it was an obligation
                            of an international character.</p>
                        <pb n="613" xml:id="pg_613" facs="0679"/>
                        <p>Dr. Alfaro then said that he recalled that President Arias had mentioned
                            to him, the day following the afore-mentioned conversation, that
                            President Roosevelt had added something to the effect that he wanted the
                            benefit of the gold payment to accrue to Panama and not “to the
                            bankers,” Dr. Alfaro stated that under the terms of the trust agreement
                            for the 1923 loan and subsequent instructions issued by the Government
                            of Panama, the Canal annuity of $250,000 was paid over by the United
                            States Government to Mr. William Nelson Cromwell as Fiscal Agent of the
                            Republic of Panama, for application against the service of the loan. Dr.
                            Alfaro said that it was his understanding that all of the $250,000 was
                            not required for the service of the 1923 loan, since the revenue from
                            the Constitutional Fund of six million dollars was also pledged to the
                            service of this loan. The 1928 loan, now in partial default, had a
                            second lien on the Canal annuity and the income from the Constitutional
                            Fund, as well as having certain specific revenues pledged in its
                            favor.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Alfaro said that it was the intention of the Republic of Panama to
                            deposit with Mr. Cromwell, as heretofore, the $250,000 in legal tender
                            money, in accordance with the Republic’s obligations; however, Panama
                            desired that the additional amount, representing the difference between
                            the annuity in “legal tender” and on a gold basis should be made
                            available directly to Panama.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Alfaro that I had not known before that this matter had been
                            discussed between the two Presidents. I said that we would at once give
                            consideration to it and would advise him later.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Welles</hi>: I attach memorandum of my
                            conversation with Dr. Alfaro, Minister of Panama, on January 17,
                                1934.<note n="28" xml:id="d593fn28"><hi rend="italic"
                                >Supra.</hi></note> In brief, Dr. Alfaro requested, under
                            instructions from President Arias, that the Canal annuity of $250,000,
                            due to be paid on February 26, 1934, should be paid on a gold basis. Dr.
                            Alfaro read me a letter he had received from President Arias, in which
                            the latter stated that he had discussed the matter with President
                            Roosevelt when the two Presidents conferred in Washington in October,
                            last, and that President Roosevelt had agreed that the payment should be
                            made on a gold basis because it was an obligation of an international
                            character. Dr. Alfaro then raised a second point, namely, that if
                            payment is made on a gold basis, <pb n="614" xml:id="pg_614" facs="0680"
                            />only the sum of $250,000 legal tender money should be paid over by the
                            United States Government to Mr. William Nelson Cromwell, as Fiscal Agent
                            of the Republic of Panama, and the balance representing the difference
                            between the annuity on a legal tender basis and on a gold basis should
                            be paid direct to the Republic of Panama for its own uses.</p>
                        <p>I also attach a memorandum<note n="29" xml:id="d593fn29">Not found in
                                Department files.</note> regarding the situation of Panama’s foreign
                            debt, and the provisions of the pertinent loan contracts, et cetera.</p>
                        <p>Briefly, my views regarding the Panamanian request are as follows:
                            Article 14 of the 1903 Treaty provides that the annuity shall be paid in
                            gold coin of the United States. It appears, from papers attached hereto,
                            that on November 10, 1933, we wrote the Secretary of the Treasury<note
                                n="30" xml:id="d593fn30">Letter not printed.</note> requesting that
                            arrangements be made for payment at the Mint par rate of exchange of
                            certain international obligations of the United States payable abroad in
                            gold currency. The Treasury took the matter up with the President, who
                            approved the request. The principle applicable to the Panamanian case,
                            therefore, seems to have been settled.</p>
                        <p>The second point, however, raised by the Panamanian request, that the
                            “velvet” represented by the amount in gold in excess of the legal tender
                            value should accrue directly to Panama, cannot, I believe, be decided
                            favorably. On June 8, 1923, the Panamanian Minister addressed a letter
                            to the Secretary of State<note n="31" xml:id="d593fn31">Not
                                printed.</note> advising of arrangements for the issuance of the
                            1923 bonds; stating that the Republic had irrevocably conferred
                            exclusive authority upon William Nelson Cromwell, as Fiscal Agent of the
                            Republic, to receive payment for a certain part of the $250,000 annually
                            until the earlier satisfaction of the Trust Indenture of November 2,
                            1914, under which the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company was Trustee, for a
                            Panamanian bond issue, “or in the event of the satisfaction of said
                            Trust Indenture of November 2, 1914, prior to February 26, 1944, to
                            receive and give acquittance for the entire amount falling due on each
                            February 26th subsequent to the satisfaction of said Trust Indenture;
                            and we hereby irrevocably authorize and request that Your Excellency’s
                            Government pay over said several sums to said William Nelson Cromwell,
                            as Fiscal Agent, or his successors, during the periods and as above
                            provided. You may accept as conclusive evidence of the satisfaction of
                            said Trust Indenture of November 2, 1914, prior to February 26, 1944, a
                            certificate executed by the Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company of New York,
                            as trustee, certifying to such satisfaction”.</p>
                        <pb n="615" xml:id="pg_615" facs="0681"/>
                        <p>On February 27, 1929, Sullivan and Cromwell forwarded to the
                                Department<note n="32" xml:id="d593fn32">Communication not
                                printed.</note> a certificate executed by the Farmers’ Loan and
                            Trust Company of New York as Trustee, certifying to the satisfaction of
                            the Trust Indenture of November 2, 1914. It would therefore seem clear
                            that under the terms of the Panamanian Minister’s letter of June 8,
                            1923, the State Department is “irrevocably” authorized and requested by
                            the Panamanian Government to pay over “the entire amount” falling due on
                            February 26. If we decide that the Canal annuity should be paid on a
                            gold basis, then it would appear that the Department is obligated to pay
                            over the entire amount of the annuity to Mr. Cromwell.</p>
                        <p>The 1928 loan is secured, in addition to certain pledged revenues, by a
                            second charge, subject to the 1923 loan, on the income from the
                            constitutional fund and the $250,000 annuity. Service in full is being
                            paid on the 1923 loan. On the 1928 loan, however, sinking fund payments
                            have not been met, and interest is being paid only to the extent that
                            funds are available from the balance of the income from the
                            constitutional fund and the annuity after prior satisfaction of the 1923
                            loan requirements. This means, in effect, that about 33% of the interest
                            requirements of the 1928 loan are being paid. If the additional amount
                            represented by payment of the annuity on a gold basis is turned over by
                            Mr. Cromwell to the Fiscal Agents for the 1928 loan, as appears to be
                            required under the Fiscal Agency contract, then the interest payments on
                            the 1928 bonds will be by that much increased. This would mean that the
                            benefit derived from payment of the annuity on a gold basis would in
                            fact inure to the Republic of Panama, since it would be applied to the
                            payment of the Republic’s outstanding obligations.</p>

                            <p>I have given full consideration to the request of the Panama
                                Government that the United States Government pay its Canal annuity
                                of $250,000 “in gold coin of the United States”. The suggestion that
                                the United States Government as the result of an official
                                conversation more than four months ago should make this February
                                payment in gold, has received my careful consideration. It will be
                                recalled that at the time of the official conversations referred to,
                                a considerable list of complaints by the Government of Panama was
                                receiving both sympathetic and favorable consideration and action. I
                                think the full nature and extent of the complaints by Panama were
                                understood by the United States Government, were reduced to a
                                    memorandum<note n="36" xml:id="d594fn36"><ref

                                        p. 863</ref>.</note> or other instrument of writing, and
                                their solution in a way favorable to the desires of the Panama
                                Government to the fullest extent deemed at all consistent by the
                                United States has been and is being gradually brought about.</p>
                            <p>Evidently any oral references to future canal annuity payments in
                                gold were not deemed of a sufficiently binding or contractual nature
                                as to be reduced to writing. The conversation apparently went no
                                further than the expression of a hope or a disposition which did not
                                and could not foresee the completely revolutionary financial and
                                monetary changes which soon took place.</p>
                            <p>The devaluation by the United States of the gold content of the
                                dollar, for example, operates in a large sense to reduce by 40 per
                                cent <pb n="617" xml:id="pg_617" facs="0683"/>external debts due and
                                payable in the United States. The gold standard in most parts of the
                                world has broken down; currencies everywhere have been dislocated;
                                currency devaluations have taken place in most important countries.
                                Nations generally recognize now that the use of gold as a currency
                                should be permanently abandoned and the gold standard, for the
                                present at least, abandoned both for internal and external purposes,
                                in most parts of the world.</p>
                            <p>Financial and monetary conditions, therefore, are entirely different
                                today, compared with what they were some months ago. For example,
                                when the British Government went off gold, great losses resulted
                                abroad, such as the virtual wiping out of the capital of the
                                Netherlands Bank and that of the Bank of France, to say nothing of
                                losses to English creditors throughout the world. American creditors
                                are experiencing similar effects.</p>
                            <p>There is still another phase which would seem to be conclusive
                                against the suggestion of the Government of Panama, which is the
                                terms of payment in the United States to the fiscal agent of Panama
                                and by him in turn to the chief holders of the Panama bonds who
                                reside in the United States. From the location and the expressed
                                terms of the payment and disposition of the entire canal annuity of
                                $250,000 under the most definite and irrevocable instructions of the
                                Panama Government, it is difficult to conclude that the Panama
                                Government would very seriously suggest that a gold bonus be handed
                                over to it to be by that Government added to the 40 per cent
                                reduction it has already potentially received on its indebtedness
                                payable in this country by reason of the devaluation of the gold
                                content of the dollar. If, in the light of the foregoing, you have
                                any suggestions to make, I should be glad to meet with you at any
                                time and talk them over.</p>

                        <p>At my request, Dr. Alfaro came in this afternoon and I explained to him
                            our way of looking at the question raised by Panama of the payment of
                            the Canal annuity in gold, (as set out in the memorandum which the
                            Secretary sent to President Roosevelt and which was approved by the
                            latter).</p>
                        <p>Dr. Alfaro explained his views at some length. In brief, he disagreed on
                            all points. As regards the conversation between the two Presidents, he
                            stated that, according to what President Arias had informed him, the
                            mention of the payment of the annuity in gold had come about as the
                            result of a statement made in confidence by <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618"
                                facs="0684"/>President Roosevelt to President Arias regarding his
                            currency program involving the ultimate devaluation of the dollar; when
                            this was mentioned, President Arias (this is the version given me by Dr.
                            Alfaro) said that there was this annuity to be paid a few months hence,
                            and he hoped very much it would be paid in gold; President Roosevelt
                            (according to Dr. Alfaro) said that of course the United States would
                            pay in gold, but that he did not want “the bankers” to get the benefit
                            of such payment, but wanted it to accrue to Panama alone.</p>
                        <p>Leaving aside the question of the conversation between the two
                            Presidents, Dr. Alfaro said that Panama’s contention was, in brief, that
                            Panama had granted certain valuable rights in the 1903 treaty to the
                            United States in return for a definite consideration, namely, the annual
                            payment of a certain value as set out in the then existing gold dollar
                            of the United States, to be made in perpetuity. Panama maintained that
                            whatever the United States might do by exercise of its sovereign will in
                            currency matters as regards its own citizens, the United States could
                            not by unilateral act set aside the rights under an international
                            compact accruing to another sovereign country. Panama’s rights in this
                            matter would be judged under international law and not under the
                            domestic law of the United States.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Alfaro asked me if this was the “final word” by the United States. I
                            said that I had explained our way of looking at it, after rather
                            thorough discussion with people in different Government departments
                            competent in such matters. I said that if Panama felt there were any
                            phases of the matter which we had not taken into consideration, we
                            should always be glad to consider them and to discuss them with him at
                            any time.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Alfaro said that he would appreciate very much an opportunity to
                            explain the Panamanian point of view to whatever officials of this
                            Government “had a say” in determining our position in the matter. He
                            said that he would like “a day in court” in order that the Panamanian
                            viewpoint might be thoroughly discussed.</p>
                        <p>I said that I would be glad, indeed, to arrange such a conference.</p>
                        <p>I told Dr. Alfaro that as the annuity was due today, February 26, we had
                            transmitted today to the Fiscal Agent of Panama in New York, as we were
                            requested to do under the irrevocable instructions of the Panamanian
                            Government, the Treasury warrant in the amount of $250,000, as we had
                            done in previous years. Dr. Alfaro said that he would communicate at
                            once with his Government, and expected instructions would be sent to the
                            Fiscal Representative either to decline to receive payment of this
                            amount in legal tender money, or else, in receiving it to enter
                            reservation as to Panama’s rights to further payment.</p>

                        <p>In accordance with the request of Dr. Alfaro, the conference was held in
                            my office today, attended by Dr. Alfaro, Mr. MacLean, Assistant
                            Solicitor General, Mr. Laylin, of the Treasury Department (in place of
                            Mr. Opper who was unable to attend), Mr. Hackworth,<note n="37"

                        <p>Dr. Alfaro set out with considerable force and at some length Panama’s
                            contentions, as he had stated them to me on February 26.</p>
                        <p>The suggestion was made to him that Panama was in no sense suffering any
                            prejudice, since the annuity payment had been assigned by Panama to the
                            bondholders and that at least until the bonds had been retired, Panama
                            would gain no benefit from the payment in gold, since this would
                            automatically accrue to the bondholders. It was suggested that in view
                            of this situation, Panama might desire to allow the situation to rest
                            for the time being until such time as Panama might actually suffer some
                            prejudice, when we could reexamine the matter.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Alfaro declined flatly to consider this suggestion. He felt, on the
                            contrary, that Panama might well derive benefit from payment on the gold
                            basis since Panama’s obligations to the bondholders, such being payable
                            in New York, were subject to the legislation of this country and hence,
                            in his view, could be paid only on a legal tender basis, whereas Panama,
                            being entitled to payment in gold from the United States Government,
                            should profit by the additional amount involved in such form of payment.
                            His contention was that the United States Government should make payment
                            in gold or on a gold basis to the Fiscal Agent and that the question of
                            what ultimately became of this payment should not be determined by the
                            United States Government, but should be left for determination by the
                            Fiscal Agent, the bondholders, and presumably the courts of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. MacLean expressed the opinion that the arrangements made by Panama,
                            under which the treaty payment was assigned to its bondholders in this
                            country, might well be a controlling factor in the situation, and said
                            that he would like time to study the provisions of the loan contracts
                            and other related documents. It was agreed that such study would be
                            made.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conference, Dr. Alfaro stated that the Fiscal Agent
                            of Panama in New York had been instructed to decline to receive the
                            payment made on February 26, and that we could expect to have <pb
                                n="620" xml:id="pg_620" facs="0686"/>such payment returned to us. It
                            was suggested to Dr. Alfaro that Panama might permit the Fiscal Agent to
                            receive this payment, reserving her rights in the matter. Dr. Alfaro
                            said, however, that this would merely result in having the matter drag
                            along, and that Panama desired to bring the issue to a head at this time
                            and to have it settled.</p>

                                also in perpetuity, that “gold coin” necessarily meant the coin

                                shall henceforth have a gold contents of 15.3 grains of the same

                                the treaty annuity, the right of Panama to the compensation agreed
                                upon in 1904 would be virtually wiped out. This possibility would be
                                so palpably contrary to the most elementary principles of justice
                                and right that to enunciate it is equivalent to a refutation of the

                                that it is for the good of the country to devaluate the dollar, to
                                abolish the gold coins, to abolish the gold clause in contracts and
                                to make “lawful currency” legal tender in all sorts of obligations,
                                and has so decreed by law.</item>

                                as provided by the treaty. An international obligation cannot be

                                of the dollar work both ways with regard to Panama. In her favor,

                        <p>Dr. Alfaro telephoned me today that he had just received a cable from his
                            Government that at the meeting of the Panamanian cabinet yesterday the
                            question of the payment of the gold annuity was considered. The cabinet
                            decided that the Fiscal Agent would be authorized “to turn over to the
                            trustees of the loans the total of the proceeds of the gold payment in
                            terms of lawful currency.” In other words, Dr. Alfaro said, the
                            Government of Panama now desires to devote to the service of its loans
                            the additional payment which it expects to receive in legal tender
                            representing payment of the annuity on a gold basis. Dr. Alfaro said
                            that he was issuing a statement to the press in these terms but wished
                            us to know of it first.</p>
                        <p>He added that he had heard from the Fiscal Agent that the latter was
                            returning the Treasury check to the State Department today.</p>

                            that the Republic of Panama maintains the position that the payment of
                            the Treaty Annuity, in accordance with the aforementioned Treaty, should
                            be made in gold coin of the weight and fineness existing in 1904 or the
                            equivalent in actual value thereof. Consequently, and in view of the
                            aforementioned advice from the Government of Panama that it does not
                            consider that the payment in question constitutes payment in full of the

                            the Panama Canal annuity of $250,000, and to the conversations I have

                                <item>That our legal obligation to pay the yearly amount due Panama
                                    in gold dollars as of the weight and fineness of 1904 is a very
                                    doubtful question;</item>

                                <item>That if we persist in our present contention, the Government
                                    of Panama will, in all probability, insist upon arbitration of
                                    the question, which, for obvious reasons, is undesirable;</item>
                                <label>3)</label>
                                <item>That it would be likewise unwise, because of its effect upon
                                    other obligations of the United States, either to admit Panama’s
                                    contention or to make any settlement which would appear to imply
                                    such admission.</item>
                            </list></p>

                            solution of the difficulty, the Government of Panama be advised that we
                            will deal with this matter in the negotiations which we are shortly to

                            for the new treaty between the two Governments and that, in the
                            meantime, the payment of $250,000. will be made “on account”. In the new
                            Convention, the annuities to be paid to Panama could be increased in
                            such an amount as would take care of the present obligation and such
                            additional concessions as we may be able to obtain with respect to other
                            matters now under consideration. The new annuities should not be
                            expressed in terms of gold, but should be expressed in dollars, with the
                            understanding that if the dollar is devaluated below the present
                            standard, the difference shall be made up to Panama, and if the dollar
                            rises above the present standard, a smaller amount shall be paid to
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>Finally, in connection with any arrangement that is made, we would take
                            into account the rights of the Trustee and of the holders of the bonds
                            of the Republic of Panama and the existing agreement on the part of
                            Panama to turn over these annuity payments to its Fiscal Agent in New
                            York for the benefit of the bondholders.</p>
                        <p>Since the matter has now been pending for some time, and the Government
                            of Panama is increasingly impatient, I shall appreciate your letting me
                            know whether the procedure above indicated meets with your

                        <p>29. For your strictly confidential information. This morning we suggested
                            orally to the Minister of Panama the advisability, in view of the number
                            of controversial questions pending between our two Governments, of
                            discussing the possibilities of negotiating a treaty as a modification
                            of the 1903 treaty to cover a settlement of such questions. <pb n="626"
                                xml:id="pg_626" facs="0692"/>We suggested that the Panamanian
                            request for payment of the Canal annuity on the basis of the former gold
                            value of the dollar might be dealt with in such discussions. The
                            Minister is to consult his Government and advise us later of its
                            views.</p>

                        <p>160. Referring to radio control on Isthmus, Commandant Fifteenth Naval
                            District informs me that Navy now prepared to turn over radio stations
                            owned and operated by the United States at La Palma and Obaldía to
                            Panaman Government. Commandant anxious to do this as soon as possible
                            for reasons of economy. He is convinced that present equipment at the
                            stations will not be appropriate for the use of Panama on account of the
                            complicated character of apparatus and expense of operation.</p>
                        <p>Commandant suggests that this Legation propose to Panaman Government that
                            present apparatus of these stations be dismantled and removed; that Navy
                            would substitute, free of all charge to Panama, receiving and
                            transmitting sets appropriate for the purposes of the stations; that
                            present Diesel engines be dismantled as too large and costly of
                            operation [and that?] they be replaced by small Delco or other
                            generators to be purchased by Panama at a cost of about $500 each
                            station. The Panaman operators who have been instructed by the Navy for
                            the past 3 months now prepared, Commandant states, to take over these
                            smaller installations.</p>
                        <p>It will be appreciated if the Department will inform me by Navy radio
                            whether it has any objection to informal inquiries being made from
                            Panaman Government provided such arrangement will be satisfactory.</p>

                        <p>19. Referring to my telegram No. 14, January 29, 4 p.m. The Panaman
                            Government has, up to the present time, failed to communicate in writing
                            its views on the radio question. I submitted on the 2d to the Secretary
                            of State for Foreign Affairs an informal draft of joint agreement
                            covering the transfer of radio stations at Obaldía and La Palma to the
                            Panaman Government, and requesting examination by Panaman authorities.
                            The draft was composed by the Legation in accordance with the
                            Department’s telegraphic instruction of November 21, 7 p.m. It was in
                            line with suggestion by the Navy here and endeavored to meet objections
                            voiced by Panama in the various conversations held by Legation since
                            November 24. Copy is being forwarded to the Department by air mail.</p>
                        <p>It provided that the transfer of the two stations would not obligate
                            Panama to clear messages from them through naval radio at Balboa and I
                            verbally expressed the willingness of the Navy to assist Panama in
                            constructing additional stations of its own in Panama City or
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0694"/>
                        <p>Secretary Arosemena said that the agreement seemed reasonable as with its
                            own radio stations Panama could initiate ship to shore service. I
                            replied that the draft agreement was certainly limited to the transfer
                            of two stations as a courtesy to Panama but in no wise affected the ship
                            to shore question whose solution was a matter of separate negotiation in
                            line with the conversations between the two Presidents<note n="44"

                            now believes, is unacceptable to Panama in the form outlined in item 8
                            of the Washington agreement.<note n="45" xml:id="d605fn45"><ref

                        <p>I said there was no objection to Panama communication with other
                            countries through the two stations or through such other stations as it
                            might install as long as the defense and operation of the Canal is
                            properly safeguarded, and that the Navy expresses a willingness to
                            construct a central station at Panama City for the Government of Panama.
                            The Secretary said that Tropical Radio would effect this service for
                            Panama.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary promised to have the radio question considered at a special
                            Cabinet meeting and to transmit the views of Panama to the Legation on
                            February 8.</p>
                        <p>The Legation can see no reconciliation of the opposing views of the Navy
                            and Panama regarding ship to shore service, and it is now clear that
                            Panama, on establishing independent operation of Obaldía and La Palma as
                            a precedent, would initiate ship to shore service through Tropical Radio
                            and disregard what the Navy so strongly considers to be essential, viz.,
                            control through a board when the United States is adequately
                            represented.</p>

                            No. 19 of February 4, 10 A.M. concerning the conversations with the
                            Panamanian Foreign Office and with President Arias concerning the
                            question of radio control in general and, specifically, the transfer to
                            Panama of the United States Naval Radio Stations at Puerto Obaldía and
                            La Palma.</p>
                        <p>There are enclosed herewith copies of a Memorandum to the Foreign Office
                            of February 2, 1934 transmitting a draft of a joint agreement covering
                            the above mentioned transfer, the agreement itself, and a copy <pb
                                n="629" xml:id="pg_629" facs="0695"/>of a Third Person Note
                            addressed to the Foreign Office on February 3, 1934.<note n="46"
                                xml:id="d606fn46">None printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Department is aware of the opposing points of view in relation to
                            conceding an ample measure of independence to Panama in its radio
                            facilities and it would appear that no advance has been made in bringing
                            these opposing viewpoints together. President Arias feels that a Radio
                            Board as suggested in the Washington conversations would meet great
                            popular resentment in Panama but is apparently unwilling to act hastily
                            in going ahead without American approval. The Navy here feels that
                            Tropical Radio is likely to initiate ship to shore service under
                            Panamanian license and that the statement of Secretary Arosemena to me
                            on February 2nd openly discloses that intention.</p>
                        <p>The Department’s instructions will be greatly appreciated. It would seem
                            that a decision should be now reached as to how far we are prepared to
                            go, whether we are prepared to recede from our former position and
                            sacrifice what the Navy considers necessary for the Canal defense, or
                            whether we are to insist on a measure of control which Panama will not
                            willingly accept and which we, in all likelihood, cannot enforce in time
                            of peace.</p>

                        <p>23. Referring to my telegram No. 19, February 4, 10 a.m. and my despatch
                            No. 106 of February 4th, Secretary for Foreign Affairs today handed me a
                            memorandum giving Panaman Government’s views regarding the agreement to
                            cover transfer of radio stations at Puerto Obaldía and La Palma. The
                            points upon which this memorandum differ substantially from the
                            Legation’s draft agreement of February 2nd are: (1) two frequencies are
                            requested on 4.000 to 5.500 band and two on 6.675 to 7.000; (2) in case
                            of war or threatened hostilities both stations shall be jointly managed
                            and controlled by the two Governments; and (3) the agreement shall not
                            limit the rights of Panama to erect, operate, and maintain radio
                            telegraphic communication from point to point or shore to ship, nor
                            shall it be considered as a limitation, definition, or restrictive
                            condition on the rights of Panama to operate radio telegraphic
                            stations.</p>
                        <p>Naval authorities here state that changes (1) and (2) are acceptable.</p>
                        <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0696"/>
                        <p>The Legation replied to the Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterating that
                            this present agreement cannot be construed as modifying any of the
                            larger aspects of the as yet unsettled radio question nor affecting
                            control of ship to shore service. It suggested that, instead of (3), the
                            following be substituted “all provisions of the foregoing paragraphs
                            relating to the operation of the radio stations at Puerto Obaldía and La
                            Palma shall be effective until superseded by the general agreement
                            concerning radio which is expected to be negotiated between the two
                            Governments.”</p>

                            113 of February 10, 1934,<note n="47" xml:id="d608fn1">Not
                                printed.</note> and to the Legation’s telegram No. 23 of February 9,
                            3 p.m., concerning the proposed agreement to cover the transfer to the
                            Panamanian Government of the Navy Radio stations at Puerto Obaldía and
                            La Palma.</p>
                        <p>After a number of conferences with the President and the Secretary for
                            Foreign Affairs in which the Legation has endeavored to reconcile the
                            conflicting views of the Navy and the Panamanian Government, I have
                            arrived at the conclusion that I should not further approach the local
                            Government in the matter until I am given further instructions by the
                            Department. The ideas of the Navy have been conveyed to the Legation by
                            Commander W. L. Ainsworth, District Communication Officer of the 15th
                            Naval District. This officer has expressed the Navy viewpoint regarding
                            each clause in the various proposed drafts of the agreement and has
                            represented the Admiral Commandant of the 15th Naval District in almost
                            daily consultation with the Legation.</p>
                        <p>It is felt that arrival at an early agreement through this Legation is
                            rendered difficult by the insistence of the Navy on points which it
                            regards as vital to Canal defense, and I accordingly informed Commander
                            Ainsworth on March first that the Legation would decline further to
                            press an agreement on the Foreign Office until instructions are received
                            from the State Department as to which points may be conceded and which
                            ones are to be regarded as essential and to be insisted upon. It is
                            understood that Admiral Crosley<note n="48" xml:id="d608fn2">Commandant
                                of the 15th Naval District.</note> at once communicated this
                            information to the Navy Department.</p>
                        <p>It would seem that the points in disagreement can only be ironed out
                            through conferences in Washington between officers of the two <pb
                                n="631" xml:id="pg_631" facs="0697"/>Departments. The Legation
                            cannot otherwise be sure that upon reaching an understanding with Panama
                            it will not be decided that we cannot concede what has been agreed upon,
                            thereby forcing reconsideration of the entire agreement. This does not
                            conduce to satisfactory negotiation or make a happy impression on the
                            other parties to the negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The Navy, in its insistence on certain frequencies to be allotted to
                            Panama for the use of these two stations, is endeavoring to avoid
                            interference and general chaos in the radio situation on the Isthmus,
                            and perhaps also to tie up Panama so fast that it will not be able to
                            communicate from ships to shore nor in any other manner considered by
                            the Navy as affecting the Canal defense.</p>
                        <p>Panama is endeavoring to insert in the agreement an admission by the
                            United States that Panama should not be restricted in its radio control.
                            It has definitely withdrawn from its position as expressed by President
                            Arias in Washington where he agreed to consider the suggestion to create
                            a Radio Control Board, similar to the Aviation Board.</p>
                        <p>Thus, this agreement to cover the transfer of two small and isolated
                            radio stations out in the jungle, of no importance in themselves, takes
                            on importance and results in long discussions, because the Navy and
                            Panama both wish to establish precedents for future radio control in the
                            wording of this agreement.</p>
                        <p>As a matter of fact, the Navy is, essentially, turning over little more
                            than the houses where the radio stations have been installed. They could
                            well withdraw and leave the houses to the jungle, and the general radio
                            situation would be practically unchanged. The location where Panama most
                            needs a radio station of its own is the penal station at Coiba Island.
                            There is a very practical reason for a station there, but there is
                            almost no reason for one at either Puerto Obaldía or La Palma other than
                            the rather vague desire of Panama to form a nucleus of a radio system
                            with these two stations.</p>
                        <p>The Legation ventures to express the hope that the conferences between
                            representatives of the State and Navy Departments will result in a final
                            decision on what measure of control is to be offered to Panama, and what
                            kind of machinery will be erected to effect the liaison between the
                            Radio authorities of the two countries on the Isthmus.</p>
                        <p>On February 16 the Naval authorities in Panama through Commander
                            Ainsworth expressed to the Legation their objection to the frequencies
                            allotted to Panama in Paragraph 3<hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the
                            Secretary for Foreign Affairs’ draft agreement of February 9,<note
                                n="49" xml:id="d608fn3">Not printed.</note> and suggested other
                            frequencies. They also stated that a clause should be added to paragraph
                            36 providing that Panama should give three months notice of <pb n="632"
                                xml:id="pg_632" facs="0698"/>any contemplated changes in the power,
                            location, or frequencies to be used by their stations. They also
                            recommended that Paragraph 6 should read as follows: <quote

                                    by both Governments, with the object of assuring that their
                                    operation will not be prejudicial in any way to the safety or
                                    operation of the Panama Canal or its defenses, or the operation
                                    of the Fleet, or to the armed forces of the United States.</p>

                        <p>The Naval authorities here furthermore requested that Paragraph 7 be
                            eliminated and the following paragraph as suggested by the Legation be
                            substituted therefor: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    general agreement concerning radio which is expected to be
                                    negotiated between the two Governments.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>After a conference with President Arias on February 17 in which he said
                            that he had personally drafted Paragraph 6, it was agreed that the
                            tentative agreement should be resubmitted to the council of ministers.
                            The President said that regardless of the stipulation for joint control,
                            in time of war or threatened hostilities the United States Navy would
                            exercise full control; that a provision in the agreement giving the
                            United States full control would be interpreted in Panama as a surrender
                            of national rights to the United States, and as a total lack of
                            confidence in the cooperation to be rendered by Panama in the defense of
                            the Canal.</p>
                        <p>Following this conference, the Navy withdrew its objection to Paragraph 6
                            and expressed agreement with the wording as given in the Memorandum from
                            the Panama Foreign Office of February 9. I consequently informed the
                            Foreign Office on February 19 that I perceived no objection to the
                            wording of paragraph 6.</p>
                        <p>On February 201 saw Secretary Arosemena who said that he would advise the
                            Legation of the desire of Panama to accept the offer made by the Navy to
                            construct new apparatus for the stations at Puerto Obaldía and La Palma
                            as well as equipment for stations to be installed at Coiba and San
                            Bias.</p>
                        <p>On the same day Commander Ainsworth furnished the Legation with a draft
                            embodying the Navy’s viewpoint regarding the agreement. (Enclosure No.
                                1).<note n="50" xml:id="d608fn4">Not printed.</note></p>
                        <p>The Legation was likewise furnished with a copy of a communication from
                            the Chief of Naval Operations to the Admiral Commandant <pb n="633"
                                xml:id="pg_633" facs="0699"/>of the 15th Naval District bearing date
                            of February 20 which stated that it was desirable that if frequencies on
                            the 2750–2850 band be allocated to these stations, it be with the
                            understanding that they be for fixed service only.</p>
                        <p>The same letter stated that the wording of Paragraph 36 was satisfactory
                            but with reference to Paragraph 3<hi rend="italic">c</hi>, the
                            provisions of points 6, 7 and 8 of the proposed agreement of February 2
                            should remain substantially as written. The Chief of Naval Operations
                            felt that joint control might be unobjectionable at the present time but
                            that changing international conditions might make it impracticable, and
                            the United States should be the judge as to when such control should
                            cease. He further believed that the United States should reserve the
                            right to close, censor, or operate either station when it believed such
                            action to be necessary for the safety or operation of the Canal.</p>
                        <p>On February 21 the Foreign Office sent the Legation a Memorandum<note
                                n="51" xml:id="d608fn5">Not printed.</note> stating that it accepted
                            the offer of the United States to recondition the stations at Puerto
                            Obaldía and La Palma and to install stations at Coiba and San Bias at a
                            cost to Panama of $3380.</p>
                        <p>On February 21 the Secretary for Foreign Affairs sent a Memorandum to the
                            Legation with a draft of the much discussed agreement, (Enclosure No. 2,
                            and translation, Enclosure No. 3).<note n="51" xml:id="d608fn6">Not
                                printed.</note> The draft appeared to be acceptable but for the
                            frequencies mentioned in Paragraph 2<hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the
                            inclusion of the unacceptable Paragraph 7.</p>
                        <p>I replied by a Note No. 102 on February 21, a copy of which is herewith
                            attached as enclosure No. 4.<note n="51" xml:id="d608fn7">Not

                        <p>This Note elicited a Note dated February 22 from the Foreign office,
                            (Enclosure No. 5, and translation, Enclosure No. 6),<note n="51"
                                xml:id="d608fn8">Not printed.</note> which accepted the
                            modifications suggested in my last mentioned Note. The way thus seemed
                            clear to transmit the agreement to the Department for its consideration,
                            but on February 23 the Navy requested a further change in Paragraph 6 in
                            order that it might read as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                                    their operation will not be prejudicial in any way to the safety
                                    or operation of the Panama Canal or its defenses, or to the
                                    operations of the Fleet or the Armed Forces of the United

                                <p>In connection with the foregoing, it is further agreed that when,

                                    the Canal is involved, the United States shall advise the
                                    Panamanian Government regarding the extent of censorship or
                                    control desired, or regarding the desirability of closing the
                                    stations, to the end that the Panamanian Government may effect
                                    such censorship, control, or closure as may be required by the
                                    circumstances.</p>

                        <p>On February 26 Commander Ainsworth stated that the desires of the Navy
                            could best be met by adding to Paragraph 6 the following sentence:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">

                        <p>On February 28 the Navy Department sent a telegram to the 15th Naval

                            the agreement of February 2 must be incorporated, and taking the stand

                        <p>On March 1 Commander Ainsworth submitted a memorandum to the Legation
                            which conveyed the Navy’s views regarding changes in Paragraph 6 of the
                            proposed agreement. This is transmitted as Enclosure No. 7.<note n="54"

                        <p>It clearly appears that we are faced with the alternatives of either
                            endeavoring to force Panama to continue to accept Navy control over its
                            radio activities, or else frankly to turn over control to Panama while
                            reserving the treaty rights to reassume control when necessary for Canal
                            defense. The Legation sees no hope of a permanently satisfactory
                            compromise between these two alternatives. Whether or not the Puerto
                            Obaldía and La Palma stations are transferred under mutually
                            satisfactory conditions, it is feared that the radio control question
                            will constantly recur with increasing acuteness and irritation and it
                            is, of course, quite possible that we would have already been confronted
                            with a <hi rend="italic">fait accompli</hi> but for the friendly
                            attitude of President Arias.</p>

                            recent informal conversation which I had with President Arias, among
                            other things, we discussed his plan concerning the establishment of a
                            radio control board along the line of that suggested by President
                            Roosevelt at the time of President Arias’ conferences in Washington, and
                            President Arias stated that he was working on a Memorandum along the
                            lines suggested so that the matter of radio in Panama would be settled,
                            that in the meantime, <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0701"/>however,
                            he was making inquiries from various Broadcasting Concerns in the States
                            as to the minimum cost of installing, for the Panama Government’s use,
                            of a broadcasting system whereby he could speak to his people on
                            government matters and keep them advised as to” what their Government
                            was doing; and that with this in view he had established in the meantime
                            the practice of having press conferences but that even that seemed to be
                            most unsatisfactory because the reporters would never set forth the
                            substance of his remarks in his own words as he would like. He stated
                            that he did not believe that the United States Government would have any
                            objection to his Government having radio broadcasting facilities which
                            would enable him to keep in touch with his people. He stated further,
                            that he would be very glad to be able to have a broadcasting set placed
                            in his office and deliver weekly addresses on matters of interest to his

                        <p>25. Your despatch No. 142 of March 3, 1934. Your conclusion not to
                            approach the Panamanian Government further in an endeavor to reach an
                            agreement covering the transfer of the radio stations at Puerto Obaldía
                            and La Palma until further instructions have been received from the
                            Department is approved. Due to the complications you report such
                            instructions will probably not be sent until after agreement on the
                            general question of control of radio in Panama has been reached.
                            Discussion of general control with the War and Navy Departments is being
                            held in abeyance pending the receipt of President Arias’ memorandum<note

                            Legation’s telegram No. 80 of April 30, 11 a.m.<note n="55"
                                xml:id="d611fn55">Not printed.</note> concerning the transfer of the

                        <p>Admiral William H. Standley, Chief of the Bureau of Naval Operations,
                            visited Panama in connection with the call of the United States Fleet
                            and on April 29 a conference was held at the Legation to discuss radio
                            control. Those present were Admiral Standley, Rear Admiral W. S.
                            Crosley, Commandant of the 15th Naval District, Commander W. L.
                            Ainsworth, Chief Communications Officer of the 15th Naval District,
                            myself and Mr. Burdett.<note n="57" xml:id="d611fn57">William C.
                                Burdett, First Secretary of Legation.</note> After an examination of
                            the divergent points of view relating to the agreement to cover the
                            transfer of the two radio stations, Admiral Standley said that the draft
                                agreement<note n="58" xml:id="d611fn58">Not printed.</note> which
                            was transmitted to the Department as Enclosure No. 1 to Despatch No. 142
                            of March 3, 1934 would be acceptable to the Navy if a paragraph were
                            included to cover thoroughly the matter of protection to the Canal in
                            the event of a threatened war or other serious eventuality. He said that
                            the wording of the agreement without such paragraph does not give the
                            Navy sufficient grounds to take over control during the twilight period
                            between peace and war; that during such period it would be highly
                            necessary for the Navy to control all radio facilities in Panama and the
                            State Department would probably not consent for the Navy to suddenly
                            exercise such control on the grounds that this action would constitute a
                            direct threat and might defeat the negotiations in progress. The Navy’s
                            taking over radio control over all Panama stations might be construed as
                            an overt act and we should cover such situation by a new paragraph in
                            the agreement. The following paragraph was finally drafted and Admiral
                            Standley said it would be immediately transmitted by radio to the Bureau
                            of Naval Operations.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Standley requested the Legation to ask the State Department for
                            instructions to present the amended agreement to the Panamanian
                            Government. The added paragraph reads as follows: <quote
                                rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“As a further consideration to the making of this agreement, the
                                    Panamanian Government hereby agrees that if at any time the
                                    operation of the foregoing stations by the Panamanian Government
                                    should endanger the safety or operation of the Panama Canal, the
                                    Panamanian Government will upon request of the United States
                                    Government, cooperate with it in so controlling or suspending
                                    the operation of said stations as to fully protect the interests
                                    of the United States.”</p>

                        <p>With regard to the general radio agreement between the two countries,
                            Admiral Standley said that the Navy would never willingly surrender
                            control over ship-to-shore or ground-to-plane messages. The agreement
                            between the two Presidents at Washington in October, 1933 was discussed,
                            particularly item 8 which said: <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0703"/>
                            <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The United States under such conditions, would agree that no
                                    special restrictions be placed on ship-to-shore service with the
                                    exception of that relative to transiting the Canal.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>Admiral Standley said he did not understand how this crept into the
                            agreement and he hoped that President Roosevelt did not really entertain
                            this view. That naval control over all radio messages from ship-to-shore
                            was most essential for the protection of the Canal. He said that he had
                            told President Arias in October, 1933 that the naval radio experts had
                            very emphatically made this recommendation to him and while he was not
                            in a position to explain in a technical way how these ship-to-shore
                            messages would endanger the Canal’s safety, he intended to accept the
                            recommendation of his experts, as that is what experts are for.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Standley read President Arias’ memorandum on radio control, a
                            copy of which the President sent the Legation on April 27, 1934, and
                            which the Legation understands has already been submitted to the
                            Department by Minister Alfaro. Admiral Standley thought that by no means
                            should we recede from our position regarding radio control and remarked
                            that the War Department agreed fully with the Navy Department’s position
                            concerning ship-to-shore messages. It should be said in this connection
                            that Admiral Standley’s statement is not exactly in accord with informal
                            conversations held with certain Army officers on the Isthmus who believe
                            that naval control over ship-to-shore service is not essential for the
                            protection of the Panama Canal.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Crosley supported Admiral Standley in his views concerning the
                            general radio control question. Both of these officers thought the new
                            draft agreement regarding Puerto Obaldía and La Palma might facilitate
                            the negotiation of the general radio control question.</p>
                        <p>There is attached hereto a copy of the amended draft agreement<note
                                n="59" xml:id="d611fn59">Not printed.</note> which the Navy now
                            desires to be presented for the consideration of the Panamanian
                            Government.</p>

                            which I have been unable to leave without notice, since the slurring

                            of Colón at a public gathering is more than should be expected.</p>
                        <p>Ever since the negotiations have been in the course of conversation
                            between the Department and the Republic of Panama,<note n="62"

                            various articles have appeared of a scurrilous nature, reflecting
                            discredit upon the United States and the American people, but the source
                            from which they came did not deserve any official notice. The article
                            referred to, however, does refer to remarks made by a public official,
                            and for that reason I have filed with the Secretary of Foreign Relations
                            of the Republic of Panama a protest, copy of which is hereto
                            attached.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to inform Your
                                Excellency that I wish to enter a protest on behalf of my Government
                                against the speech which was made by Mr. Luis Sayavedra, Municipal
                                Auditor of the City of Colón, on the 2nd day of November, 1934,
                                before a large audience, on the first day of Panama’s program of
                                celebrations of Panama’s thirty-first independence anniversary, when
                                he referred to the United States as a monster beside whom Sir Henry
                                Morgan who sacked Old Panama was an angel. This speech appeared in
                                the <hi rend="italic">Panama American</hi> of Saturday, November 3,
                                1934. I think that such remarks, coming from an officer, are wholly
                                uncalled for and inexcusable, and I demand on behalf of my
                                Government an apology.</p>
                            <p>There have been many speeches recently made and published in the
                                newspapers discrediting my Government, but I have not until the
                                present paid much attention to it and indexed them as coming from
                                those who knew no better than to make such statements, but when
                                statements such as above mentioned emanate from a public official, I
                                am duty bound to take notice of the same and to file a protest
                                thereto. I regret that such incidents should happen, as they tend to
                                disrupt, not only the Good Neighbor Policy maintained by my
                                Government, but also the friendship which would exist between my
                                people and those of Panama.</p>
                            <p>Accept [etc.]</p>

                                in Colon on November 2nd, since, as Your Excellency knows, it has
                                the very highest opinion of the Government of the United States of
                                America so worthily represented here by Your Excellency.</p>
                            <p>Therefore, the Government of Panama does not or could not assume any

                            dated November 3, 1934, regarding the formal protest which you made to
                            the Panamanian Government on account of the speech of Mr. Sayavedra,
                            Municipal Auditor of Colón, has come to my attention. I feel that I must
                            express to you my opinion that such action on your part was inadvisable
                            in the circumstances. The Government of Panama of course is no more
                            responsible for the sentiments expressed by a municipal employee of the
                            City of Colón than is the Federal Government of the United States
                            responsible for remarks made by a municipal employe in any town or city
                            of this country.</p>
                        <p>The above view disposes of your demand for an apology which might, I
                            feel, have given rise to an unpleasant incident, had the Panamanian
                            Secretary for Foreign Affairs been so inclined; fortunately Dr.
                            Arosemena was not so inclined.</p>

                        <p>At the time when the President handed me this draft with the request that
                            it be transmitted to you for your consideration, he informed me that he
                            considered the results of the Ottawa Agreements<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d617fn4">The trade agreements concluded during the Imperial

                            and that he believed that the American packing <pb n="642"
                                xml:id="pg_642" facs="0708"/>interests in Uruguay were already
                            feeling the effects of this agreement and would soon feel them more
                            severely. The President then observed “if this reaction upon the exports
                            of our principal commodity continues, Uruguay will be ruined in five
                            years”.</p>
                        <p>He then emphasized the importance to Uruguay of revenue from this
                            source—observing that while Argentina and Brazil, also exporters of
                            cattle, had other products upon which they could rely, Uruguay was
                            limited by conditions of topography and soil to principally pastoral
                            pursuits. As a basis upon which to restore tariffs, or as a norm to
                            which mutually advantageous comparisons might now be made, he referred
                            to the tariff situation of 1928 which had been favorable to both
                            nations, adding that the sale of American automobiles in Uruguay had at
                            that time been satisfactory to us but that the automobile business at
                            the present time was far from satisfactory—sales having been greatly
                            reduced on account of lack of exchange and the Uruguayan demand far from
                            satisfied for the same reason.</p>
                        <p>President Terra closed his remarks by expressing the hope that a solution
                            might be proposed which would be practical and not theoretical.</p>
                        <p>As I reported to you at that time, I informed President Terra that
                            although you were not in a position to discuss bilateral commercial
                            treaties at this time, both the draft of the treaty and the President’s
                            observations would receive your attentive consideration—particularly in
                            their relation to the economic principles that might emerge from the
                            Conference, which had not at that time discussed the broader economic
                            phases as set forth in your proposal. You will also recall that in your
                            conversation with the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs you
                            informed him that the tentative provisions of the treaty, the problems
                            advanced by the Uruguayan Delegation, and all other relevant matters,
                            would be considered by our Government in due course.</p>
                        <p>Since the close of the Conference the matter has not again been broached
                            to me, but it may be said that the matter of Uruguay’s export of meat
                            and meat products is as much to the fore as it ever was—especially in
                            connection with the newspaper reports that cattle breeding interests in
                            the United States have requested the Tariff Commission to raise the
                            tariff on meat imports (as reported by telegraph in my telegrams Nos. 3
                            and 5 of January 5 and 13, respectively<note n="5" xml:id="d617fn5"
                                >Neither printed.</note>) American exporters, and Uruguayan
                            importers of American goods, are faced in increasing degree by a
                            continuing demand for certain American products which the producers are
                            less and less inclined to furnish unless some solution be found by which
                            the “frozen” peso accounts accumulated from previous sales may be
                            released.</p>

                        <p>The Chargé d’Affaires of Uruguay called to discuss the question of a
                            reciprocity commercial treaty between our two countries. I stated to him
                            that I had fully explained to his President Terra, to the head of the
                            Uruguayan Foreign Office and their Delegation to the Montevideo
                            Conference, just what the situation was, and I repeated it to him,
                            which, in brief, was that in the first place I was as anxious as any
                            person to negotiate reciprocity treaties which would develop mutually
                            profitable trade to the fullest extent. I then called attention at
                            length to the wild extremes to which all countries had drifted since the
                            War in the direction of economic nationalism and isolation; that this
                            policy of extremism had dried up world trade; that it would require some
                            time to educate public sentiment back in the same direction; and that,
                            therefore, each country must recognize the difficulties of the others
                            and realize that a country like the United States could only get back to
                            economic sanity by degrees, so far as liberal commercial policy to fully
                            restore international trade was concerned—that as it returned to the
                            more liberal plan of international economic cooperation, it could
                            correspondingly enter upon reciprocity commercial treaties. I said I was
                            opposed to embargoes or absolute prohibitions with respect to any and
                            all commodities; and I earnestly hoped that at the earliest date the
                            United States could enter into reciprocity treaties with countries like
                            Uruguay which would embrace at least a few minor commodities at the
                            beginning with the idea that by degrees in the future as public
                            sentiment permitted the number could be increased. I said I felt that to
                            the extent that any two countries could agree upon a mutually profitable
                            exchange of commodities, it was a most important objective to have in
                            mind.</p>
                        <p>I told the Chargé that of course the United States would not expect to
                            sell any substantial quantities of meat or wheat to Uruguay or to the
                            Argentine or any similar country that produced these for export, nor, on
                            the other hand, should those two countries expect to sell any
                            substantial amount to the United States which likewise produced them for
                            export. I expressed the hope that after Congress acted on such
                            application as might be made for power for the Executive to negotiate
                            reciprocal commercial treaties based on mutual tariff concessions
                            without the same having to be ratified by the Senate, we would be in a
                            position to take up with all countries, as rapidly as possible, the
                            negotiation of reciprocity treaties that would contemplate such
                            commodities as might be deemed feasible in the light of public sentiment
                            and which might be increased in number from year to year as sentiment
                                <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0710"/>and general conditions
                            permitted or made feasible. I made no definite commitments in any way
                            except to outline and analyze the situation as above.</p>

                        <p>The Minister, during his call, inquired whether there were any new
                            developments touching possibilities of a further trade agreement between
                            Uruguay and the United States. I replied that we had individuals and
                            groups carefully developing all the facts and making studies of trade
                            possibilities with most of the Latin American countries, including
                            Uruguay, and that during the coming months we hoped to be able to do
                            what then might prove to be feasible in the way of further trade
                            arrangements. I reminded him that we were obliged to move very slowly,
                            having in mind opposition sentiment and other extreme difficulties to
                            overcome, but that we were very anxious to work out any and all possible
                            additional trade arrangements with his and certain other countries; that
                            it would probably be after the November election; and that moreover at
                            the beginning it might only be possible to work out agreements which
                            related to but very few and possibly minor commodities; that however as
                            sentiment improved it would be possible within six or twelve months
                            following to develop a supplementary trade agreement, etc. The Minister
                            replied that he fully understood the situation. He finally suggested
                            that Uruguay produces a better cognac than France and that they could
                            receive a substantial amount of cotton goods from us in exchange for
                            cognac. I requested him to talk with Dr. Sayre<note n="6"

                            that we would keep all phases of these suggestions specially in mind
                            until the time an opportunity came to consider them more definitely and

                            largely in any treaty negotiations carried on with Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>At various times in the course of the exchange discussions<note n="8"
                                xml:id="d620fn8">See <ref target="#pg_647">pp. 647</ref> ff.</note>
                            of the past fifteen days I had noted the recurrence of a statement made
                            by Uruguayan officials to the effect that the importation into the
                            United States of 30,000 tons of Uruguayan meat per year in addition to
                            the amount already imported would solve present exchange difficulties.
                            The Uruguayan officials appeared to think that sufficient dollar
                            exchange would then be available in Uruguay to permit payment of
                            obligations on the country’s external debt bonds held under American
                            ownership and provide for trade requirements in the amount necessitated
                            for the transactions now taking place.</p>
                        <p>The relatively restricted quantity of additional meat which the official
                            supervisors of the Uruguayan export trade would be pleased to place in
                            the United States may seem to be worth considering in order that the
                            position of advantage which American trade is gradually acquiring in
                            Uruguay should not be hampered by any difficulties due to scarcity of
                            dollar exchange.</p>
                        <p>The information available to the Legation seems to indicate that the
                            average cost per ton of Uruguayan export meat is $110.00. Accordingly,
                            an amount of approximately $3,300,000 in additional dollar exchange
                            would enter Uruguay yearly in case exports to the United States would be
                            increased by the 30,000 tons suggested in Montevideo.</p>
                        <p>According to the estimates of the Director of the Bank of the Republic,
                            where foreign exchange operations are controlled, the present yearly
                            requirement of dollar exchange amounts to over 12,300,000 pesos,
                            distributed in the following manner on the basis of 1933 figures: <table

                        <p rend="flushleft">The value of United States imports from Uruguay for the
                            year 1933, according to the official United States statistics compiled
                            by the Department of Commerce, attained $3,772,861.00. This figure
                            represents dollars which have not been adjusted for depreciation of the
                            dollar from its former gold parity during 1933. In view of the existence
                            of various rates of exchange, known as official, gray and free, it is
                            impossible to convert with any accuracy into dollars the peso amount of
                            the distribution table submitted in the previous paragraph. It would
                            seem, however, that the 4,800,000 pesos estimated for trade requirements
                            at the Bank of the Republic correspond to $3,772,861.</p>
                        <pb n="646" xml:id="pg_646" facs="0712"/>
                        <p>The Department is aware through reports from the Legation and the
                            Consulate General that whereas in 1933 exports from the United States to
                            Uruguay conferred the fourth place to the United States in the list of
                            exporting countries to Uruguay, the first six months of 1934 indicate
                            that American exports now give the United States the third place on the
                            same list.</p>
                        <p>According to Uruguayan statistics our exports to Uruguay during the first
                            half of 1934 amounted to 4,663,901 pesos, while our imports for that
                            period were valued at 4,071,663 pesos. In the first six months of 1933,
                            the United States sold 2,532,622 pesos worth of goods to Uruguay and
                            bought 1,909, 123 pesos worth of Uruguayan goods. These figures indicate
                            that while the volume of trade between United States and Uruguay is
                            growing, Uruguay’s unfavorable balance is declining. The figures for the
                            first half of 1934 indicate that this unfavorable balance is now 6.8% in
                            its relation to the total trade whereas in 1933 the percentage was
                            14%.</p>
                        <p>With the restrictions now being introduced by the Uruguayan Government,
                            particularly with regard to the bill now before the Uruguayan Congress
                            embodying the Government’s decision to forbid the importation of
                            products for which an import license had not previously been obtained,
                            the prospect for a continued advance in the position which American
                            trade is acquiring seems less favorable. The question, hence, arises as
                            to whether the importation of 30,000 tons of meat yearly, as suggested
                            in Uruguay, is of sufficient interest to the American export trade to
                            Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>My personal impression is that the tonnage suggested in Uruguayan
                            official circles is a maximum figure probably to be set forth eventually
                            for negotiation purposes. For the sake of precision I may add here that
                            the term official circles in this instance refers to the Commercial
                            Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the office of the
                            Director of the Bank of the Republic which supervises foreign exchange
                            transactions.</p>
                        <p>In the conversations which I have had on recent occasions with Uruguayan
                            officials, I have made it a point to lay stress on the present situation
                            in the agricultural regions of the United States in order to impress
                            them with the difficulties existing in the way of any increase in
                            agricultural importations to the United States.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the scarcity of dollar exchange to which Uruguayan
                            officials allude when talking about payment of interest and amortization
                            services on bonds held under American ownership, I have always pointed
                            out that maintenance of debt service payments was an obligation assumed
                            by the borrowers and that commitments of this particular type should be
                            met irrespective of the amount of exchange available from the particular
                            country to which debt service payments <pb n="647" xml:id="pg_647"
                                facs="0713"/>were to be made. I have expressed, as my personal
                            opinion, that surpluses of foreign exchange from countries with which
                            Uruguay had a favorable trade balance could be utilized for interest and
                            amortization service on Uruguayan bonds held abroad to the greater
                            advantage of Uruguayan credit.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to my strictly
                            confidential despatch No. 495 of May 16, 1934,<note n="11"
                                xml:id="d623fn11">Not printed.</note> entitled “Allotment of
                            Exchange to American Interests”, and in continuation thereof to give the
                            figures for the first four months of 1934, as well as the totals of the
                            exports from Uruguay to the United States for the same period for
                            comparison therewith.</p>
                        <p>In the despatch above referred to, it was stated that there was some
                            doubt as to how the new basic figure for exchange allotments to the
                            United States (which was apparently due as a result of increased
                            Uruguayan exports to the United States) should be obtained. It has been
                            learned from an official of the Exchange Control Commission that the
                            formula used by the Commission is still the original one, according to
                            which the exchange to be allotted to American interests should be 231%
                            of the value of the Uruguayan exports to the United States during any
                            given period. In other words, the allotting of exchange is to vary
                            immediately with American purchases, and to be equalized as promptly as
                            possible, instead of in a subsequent period. This policy has not been
                            followed by the Control Commission, however, either for the year 1933 or
                            for the first four months of 1934. It is believed that the Commission’s
                            failure to do so is the reason for the non-publication of figures for
                            1933. The Commerce Committee of the American Association of Uruguay,
                            acting on this assumption, has decided to request from the Control
                            Commission a statement of the exchange allotted to American interests
                            during the second half of 1933 and the basis thereof (a similar
                            statement for the first six months of 1933 having been received). As
                            mentioned in my previous despatch, the total amount of exchange allotted
                            to American interests in 1933 was 10,441,019 pesos, while 231% of the
                            value of Uruguayan exports to the United States in 1933 equals
                            12,820,500 pesos.</p>
                        <p>For the first four months of 1934, the total amount of exchange allotted
                            to American interests was 2,618,804 pesos, which was converted to
                            dollars 2,044,263. The inadequacy of this allotment is apparent when it
                            is compared with the value of the exports to the United <pb n="649"
                                xml:id="pg_649" facs="0715"/>States during the same period, which,
                            according to Uruguayan official statistics were valued at 2,628,750
                            pesos, 231% of which would be 6,072,313 pesos, which is apparently the
                            amount of exchange that should have been allotted.</p>
                        <p>The exchange allotted month by month, in pesos, the rate used, and the
                            total in dollars, is given herewith:</p>
                        <p>[Here follows statistical table, not printed.]</p>
                        <p>On April 9, 1934, the Exchange Control Commission took over the
                            distribution of the so-called “compensated exchange”, fixing its price
                            at 40% above the cost to the Uruguayan buyer of official exchange. The
                            figures obtained from the Control Commission now include the amount of
                            “compensated” exchange allotted, in addition to that granted at the
                            official rate. As this Consulate General has learned that the figures
                            for the total exchange granted for American interests in the past also
                            included “compensated” exchange, the totals for the months of January,
                            February and March have been broken down into official and “compensated”
                            exchange in order that they may be compared with the figures for April
                            and with future totals. It is noted that a very important part, nearly
                            half, of the exchange distributed to American interests for general
                            imports (not including petroleum products) was in the form of
                            compensated exchange, which explains the complaints of importers of
                            American goods that they were individually receiving very little
                            official exchange. From these figures, there was only exchange amounting
                            to 501,230 pesos granted for American goods, (except petroleum products)
                            during the first four months of 1934. The reason for the separate
                            classification of petroleum products has been explained in previous
                            despatches from the Legation and this Consulate General, and is due to
                            the fact that the Control Commission charges such products, not to the
                            quota of the country of origin, but according to the nationality of the
                            handling company. Information obtained in the past by this Consulate
                            General has indicated that much of these commodities imported into
                            Uruguay by American-owned companies were not of American origin, and the
                            Commerce Committee has not, as yet, accepted this procedure, tending to
                            favor the practice of allotting exchange according to the country of
                            origin of the merchandise. It has not formally protested to the Exchange
                            Control Commission, however, deeming it desirable to await some
                            statement of policy from the State Department which might serve as
                            guidance. The detailed figures of exchange distributed to American
                            interests during the first four months of 1934 were as follows:</p>

                        <p>31. Recently published press reports from London state that American
                            interests in Uruguay are being jeopardized by foreign exchange
                            negotiations now being conducted between that country and Great Britain
                            in which Great Britain is insisting, with threat of compulsory action,
                            that Uruguay allocate the greater part of its sterling exchange in
                            settlement exclusively of all British long term obligations,
                            British-Uruguayan trade necessities, and payment of dividends due on
                            British investments in Uruguay. The report adds that this would prevent
                            or seriously prejudice payment of American and other foreign obligations
                            of Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>Please discuss this question with the Foreign Minister expressing our
                            confidence that the Uruguayan Government will strongly resist any effort
                            in case any is being made, to have it discriminate against American
                            interests. So far as service on Uruguayan external obligations is
                            concerned, you may recall that the present service on Uruguayan dollar
                            bonds is made on a flat 3½% basis irrespective of the fact that some of
                            the issues carry 8%, others 6%, and others 5%. This existing arrangement
                            is understood to be made on the basis of treating all Uruguayan external
                            obligations alike, but it ignores the fact that <pb n="651"
                                xml:id="pg_651" facs="0717"/>it gives the British full interest
                            service (their bonds in great part drawing only 3½% interest) and gives
                            American holders the disproportionate service indicated. Furthermore, it
                            is worth recalling that Argentina in the Roca Agreement with Great
                                Britain,<note n="13" xml:id="d625fn13">See <ref

                            from Argentina to Britain, nevertheless insisted that there should first
                            be deducted from such exchange sums necessary to effect payment of
                            service on Argentina’s public external debts, national, provincial and
                            municipal, payable in countries other than Great Britain.</p>

                        <p>47. Department’s 31, July 10, 6 p.m. Following a conversation this
                            evening with Foreign Minister regarding press reports from London
                            referred to in above cited telegram the Minister confirmed British
                            insistence on the total allocation of sterling exchange as indicated in
                            Department’s July 10, 6 p.m., but added that Uruguayan Government was
                            insisting upon retaining sufficient exchange to apply Uruguayan external
                            debts to other than British creditors. Great Britain, he continued,
                            still refused to agree to this Uruguayan suggestion of exchange
                            distribution on the plea that British exchange should not be diverted to
                            non-British uses. Nevertheless, the Minister stated that Uruguayan
                            viewpoint of retaining sufficient exchange for other than British
                            indebtedness would be maintained. He furthermore claimed familiarity
                            with recent agreement between Argentina and Great Britain which he
                            considered as fair. I shall see the Minister tomorrow and may report
                            again.</p>

                        <p>48. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 31, and Legation’s 47, July
                            12, 6 p.m., Minister of Foreign Affairs informed me this morning <pb
                                n="652" xml:id="pg_652" facs="0718"/>that Uruguay was suggesting
                            giving Great Britain 90 percent of sterling exchange and retaining the
                            balance of 10 percent for use in allocation of exchange to countries
                            other than Great Britain. Discussions at present were based, he said, on
                            the amount of these respective percentages and while British had been
                            unyielding at first, he thought he detected signs of possible
                            willingness on their part to accept 90 percent sterling exchange. He
                            expressed hope that an arrangement on the above mentioned division of
                            percentages would be made finally with Great Britain but cautiously
                            added that Uruguay could not prevail against Great Britain’s economic
                            strength.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Confirming my telegrams No. 47 and 48 of
                            July 12, 6 pm. and July 13, 2 pm., respectively, in which, complying
                            with the Department’s telegraphic instructions contained in its telegram
                            No. 31, of July 10, 6 pm., I reported the result of my discussions with
                            the Foreign Minister about recent press items published in London to the
                            effect that American interests in Uruguay were being jeopardized by the
                            foreign exchange negotiations now being conducted between Great Britain
                            and Uruguay, as a result of British insistence, with threat of
                            compulsory action, that Uruguay allocate the greater part of its
                            sterling exchange in settlement exclusively of all British exchange
                            requirements thus seriously prejudicing payment of American and other
                            foreign obligations of Uruguay, I have the honor to report, in
                            amplification of both of my above quoted telegrams, that I had the
                            opportunity of talking to the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday
                            evening and this morning. In both interviews his conversation indicated
                            considerable anxiety as to Uruguayan ability to resist British pressure
                            now being exerted to compel allocation to Great Britain of all sterling
                            exchange.</p>
                        <p>The attitude of the Foreign Minister reflects general sentiment in this
                            country and is based primarily, as far as I am able to ascertain, on the
                            exceedingly precarious economic condition in which Uruguay would be
                            placed at once in case of the slightest cessation of its meat exports to
                            Great Britain. It is evident that the fear of a possible curtailment in
                            these meat exports to Great Britain dominates the mind of the Foreign
                            Minister to an extent which he appears unable to hide.</p>
                        <p>Complying with the Department’s telegraphic instructions, I recalled in
                            the course of my discussion with him that the existing <pb n="653"
                                xml:id="pg_653" facs="0719"/>arrangement regarding interest service
                            of a flat 3½% basis on Uruguayan dollar bonds undoubtedly favored
                            British holders as the British share of these bonds was originally
                            issued at 3½% interest whereas American holders had to suffer cuts in
                            interest yield which in some instances amounted to 50%. I also referred
                            to the Roca Agreement<note n="13a" xml:id="d628fn13a">League of Nations
                                Treaty Series, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">cxliii</hi>, p. 67.</note>
                            between Argentina and Great Britain in which Argentina had made
                            reservations for exchange funds necessary to effect payment of service
                            on Argentina’s public external debts in countries other than Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>Minister Arteaga was familiar with the Roca Agreement and stated that he
                            considered it as fair. Moreover he thought that Uruguay was acting along
                            similar lines. In my interview this morning, as reported in telegram No.
                            48 of the above two telegrams, he stated that he hoped that it would be
                            possible to retain 10% of sterling exchange for the exchange
                            requirements of other countries than Great Britain. This, he stated, in
                            addition to the exchange acquired through sale of Uruguayan exports to
                            countries other than Great Britain would suffice for distribution of
                            exchange to American and other interests in a manner which would not be
                            discriminatory against them as compared to the amounts paid to Great
                            Britain.</p>
                        <p>I spoke to him then on my reliance on his own sense of fairness and
                            expressed our confidence that the Uruguayan Government would strongly
                            resist any effort which might be made to have it discriminate against
                            American interests. To this he replied that his Government’s endeavor to
                            retain a 10% balance of sterling exchange was evidence of Uruguayan
                            desire to avoid discrimination and said that he would try to maintain
                            insistence on the retention of the 10% balance as long as it could be
                            done without prejudice to Uruguayan interests.</p>

                            receipt of the Department’s instruction No. 258 of July 5,<note n="14"
                                xml:id="d629fn14">Not printed.</note> in which referring to the
                            Department’s telegram No. 30 of July 3, relative to arrangements made
                            with the Federal Reserve authorities for the visit of Mr. John H.
                            Williams, economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
                            Legation is informed that Mr. Williams, accompanied by Mr. Donald R.
                            Heath of the Division of Latin American Affairs of the Department, <pb
                                n="654" xml:id="pg_654" facs="0720"/>will arrive in Rio de Janeiro
                            on July 13 and will thence proceed to Buenos Aires prior to returning to
                            the United States by way of the West Coast.</p>
                        <p>It is gratifying to find that the Department considers it desirable that
                            Mr. Williams should visit Montevideo and be of assistance in the
                            problems arising in Uruguay as a result of exchange control in the
                            country. It is noted also that Mr. Williams himself is anxious to
                            include Montevideo in his itinerary, subject to the limitations in time
                            of leave granted him by the Federal Reserve authorities.</p>
                        <p>A review of the exchange situation at the present moment leads me to
                            conclude that Mr. Williams’ presence at Montevideo, for part of a day,
                            at least, while on his way to Buenos Aires would be of positive
                            importance. I am enclosing herewith copies of a telegram and a letter
                            addressed to him<note n="15" xml:id="d629fn15">Neither printed.</note>
                            which are self-explanatory regarding the value of not omitting
                            Montevideo from his itinerary. His visit, should he decide to make it,
                            will be all the more useful in view of the conversations on problems of
                            exchange which have taken place between Minister Wright and the Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs, and which I am carrying on since Mr. Wright’s
                            departure. As steamers proceeding to Buenos Aires by way of Montevideo
                            usually stop over during a great part of the day in this city, it is
                            believed that the enforced stay in the capital will provide Mr. Williams
                            with sufficient time to meet the leading officials and business men here
                            who are dealing with the exchange problems of Uruguay. Care will be
                            taken to provide him with the necessary contacts within the duration of
                            his stay, and the Department will be kept informed of developments as
                            they arise.</p>

                        <p>83. For Doctor Williams. Recent developments in the exchange situation in
                            Uruguay prejudicial to American interests make it seem highly important
                            that you visit Montevideo and study the problem there. I very much hope
                            that you will find it possible to do so, even though this may mean
                            extending your trip 10 days or 2 weeks longer.</p>

                        <p>32. Your 47 and 48, July 12, 6 p.m., and July 13, 2 p.m. From preliminary
                            consideration of the matter it seems clear that retention of 10 per cent
                            of sterling exchange for use in allocation of exchange to countries
                            other than Great Britain will not allow Uruguay to give anywhere near as
                            favorable treatment to American exporters and investors in allocating
                            exchange as she apparently proposes to give British exporters and
                            investors. Please discuss this with the Foreign Minister and report his
                            views. Discrimination in Uruguay against American interests obviously
                            must cause unfavorable reaction in this country.</p>

                        <p>49. Department’s telegram No. 32, July 19, 1 p.m. In view of absence from
                            capital of Minister for Foreign Affairs, I discussed today with
                            Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs the matter of prevention of
                            discrimination against American interests in allocation of exchange.
                            Undersecretary informed me that no decision had been reached as a result
                            of exchange conversations with Great Britain and expressed assurance
                            that Minister for Foreign Affairs would keep me informed of the progress
                            of exchange discussions between Uruguay and Great Britain. I hope to
                            report further after return of Minister for Foreign Affairs who is
                            expected tomorrow.</p>

                        <p>50. Referring to Department’s telegram No. 32, July 19, 1 p.m. and my
                            telegram No. 49, July 20, 5 p.m.</p>
                        <p>I have discussed again with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Saturday
                            and today the question of prevention of possible discrimination against
                            American interests in allocation of foreign exchange. He believes no
                            discrimination will exist as long as the same percentage, <pb n="656"
                                xml:id="pg_656" facs="0722"/>based on the value of country’s imports
                            of Uruguayan products, is provided respectively to each importing
                            country and suggests that increase in American purchases of Uruguayan
                            products, principally meat, will provide increasing amounts of dollar
                            exchange. He also emphasized the difficult economic position in which
                            Uruguay is now placed as a result of scarcity of foreign exchange due to
                            the insufficient quantity of its exports. I have called his attention to
                            the inevitable conclusion which will be reached in the United States
                            that discrimination against American interests exists if sufficient
                            dollar exchange to meet American requirements of trade and of investment
                            services is not provided while British investors and exporters continue
                            securing all sterling exchange they need. He informed me the British
                            have complained of discrimination against them because the percentage
                            allotted to American interests has been higher in the past than that
                            given to British. However, Minister stated definitely today that equal
                            treatment would be extended and that he would be able to make more
                            definite statements when British negotiations had progressed further. A
                            paraphrase of this telegram is being provided to the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs to avoid possibility of misunderstanding.</p>

                        <p>The luncheon was followed by the presentation of the visitors to the
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs at 2:30 p.m. I had arranged for this
                            meeting to enable these gentlemen to pay their respects to the Minister,
                            and also with the idea of providing for an exchange of views on the
                            Uruguayan exchange situation between Dr. Williams and the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, who is intimately acquainted with exchange developments
                            in Uruguay and who has taken the lead, personally, in the exchange
                            negotiations carried on between his country and several of the countries
                            which provide the Uruguayan market with foreign exchange.</p>
                        <p>This call was followed immediately by a round table conference at the
                            Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Minister attended the conference in
                            person together with the chief of the Commercial Section of the Ministry
                            of Foreign Affairs, the Director of the Bank of Uruguay and
                            representatives of American and Uruguayan interests. Consul General
                            Leslie E. Reed, whom I had asked to accompany me to this meeting, was
                            also present. The Uruguayan viewpoint on the exchange situation was
                            submitted to Dr. Williams by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, supported
                            by the representatives of Uruguayan interests who were in attendance,
                            while the American views were presented by the manager of the local
                            branch of the National City Bank, Mr. H. H. Whitman, who is also
                            President of the American Association of Uruguay. Technical discussions
                            and details of this conference will be incorporated in Dr. Williams’
                            analysis of the observations made on his trip.</p>
                        <p>The argument developed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs consisted in
                            the statement that foreign exchange was becoming increasingly scarce in
                            Uruguay as Uruguayan exports tended to decline, and that this scarcity
                            of exchange was now accompanied by pressure on the part of European
                            countries having favorable commercial balances in their trade with
                            Uruguay for recovery of their respective exchange through Uruguayan
                            purchases of their products. The Uruguayan Government was thus being
                            forced into canalization of its foreign trade on a basis of purchasing
                            from the countries which purchased from Uruguay. The Minister expressed
                            himself as being opposed to this method of international trade but spoke
                            of it as a case of <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> at the present
                            time, in order to prevent cessation of meat exports from Uruguay. He
                            then gave voice to opinions which I have previously reported to the
                            Department, namely, that foreign exchange would be provided mainly,
                            under the Uruguayan exchange control system, to importers of the
                            nationalities which purchased from Uruguay and that where exchange would
                            be allotted to any one country in amounts representing percentages of
                            the value of that country’s purchases of Uruguayan products, the same
                            percentage would be attributed to other countries in order to prevent
                            discrimination.</p>
                        <pb n="658" xml:id="pg_658" facs="0724"/>
                        <p>Throughout the conference it was apparent that the Uruguayan position was
                            controlled almost exclusively by the fear of a possible cessation, or a
                            curtailment, of its meat exports to the main purchasing countries. The
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs stated several times that Uruguay was
                            forced to adopt the exchange restrictions now being put into effect
                            because of the insistence which countries like Great Britain, France,
                            Germany and Italy were maintaining for the return of all exchange
                            emanating from each one of them respectively.</p>
                        <p>In the course of this conference, Dr. Williams drew on his broad
                            experience to summarize the Uruguayan situation and was able to convince
                            the Minister for Foreign Affairs that a policy of restricting imports,
                            although perfectly sound, might defeat its purpose if applied unwisely
                            or in a manner which would prevent the pooling by Uruguay of foreign
                            exchange flowing into the country so as to make use of the foreign
                            currencies in the payment of its external obligations as well as in the
                            best interests of the Uruguayan consumer. Dr. Williams spoke with
                            authority, based on intimate knowledge of exchange conditions in various
                            important countries of the world. I noticed that the Uruguayan gentlemen
                            present at the round table conference, and in particular the Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs, were greatly impressed by his statements.</p>
                        <p>Later in the evening, Dr. Williams had an opportunity of discussing
                            further the Uruguayan exchange problem with the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, as both met at the Legation as my guests for dinner.</p>
                        <p>On the 28th, Dr. Williams and his party met the Director of the Banco de
                            la República Oriental del Uruguay, at the Bank’s offices, to discuss
                            particular aspects of the country’s exchange problem and in order to
                            obtain data regarding the present exchange situation. This meeting
                            lasted an hour, and enabled Dr. Williams to obtain an insight into the
                            practical working of the Uruguayan exchange control, which is exercised
                            through the agency of the Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay.
                            The bank is also the Uruguayan correspondent of the Federal Reserve
                            Bank.</p>
                        <p>The meeting at the Bank was followed by a courtesy call on the Minister
                            of Finance. The Minister for Foreign Affairs kindly undertook to present
                            the three visitors to his colleague and I accompanied them to the
                            Ministry of Finance. There the Finance Minister, Señor Manini Rios,
                            indicated that while Uruguayan finances were in favorable condition and
                            the country enjoyed a balanced budget, it was nevertheless necessary to
                            prevent a flow of foreign currency out of the country in excess of the
                            amount brought in.</p>
                        <p>In the afternoon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs received Messrs.
                            Williams, Heath and Lamb at his home, the opportunity being thus offered
                            for further discussion of various aspects of the Uruguayan <pb n="659"
                                xml:id="pg_659" facs="0725"/>exchange situation. Dr. Williams’
                            report will contain the technical considerations which are, perforce,
                            omitted from this despatch.</p>
                        <p>It is gratifying to find that I am able to report that the visit of Dr.
                            Williams to Montevideo at this time may be considered as particularly
                            fortunate. His profound knowledge of economics and his familiarity with
                            foreign exchange problems created a favorable atmosphere around him
                            whenever he found himself among Uruguayan officials and disposed them to
                            listen attentively to his remarks. I was struck with the excellent
                            impression he had created when we went to the Ministry of Finance, and I
                            am in a position to substantiate this observation in the following
                            manner. While our call at the Ministry of Finance was in progress I
                            noted that an undertone conversation took place between the Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Finance, on ways and methods of
                            enforcing exchange control in the course of which the Minister of
                            Finance said to his colleague that they would be fortunate if they could
                            find an advisor as competent as Dr. Williams, or—pointing to Messrs.
                            Heath and Lamb—a young man of the caliber of these two men, in order to
                            place him in charge of the exchange control system. These remarks,
                            although not particularly intended for my ears gave me an opportunity
                            later in the day to intimate discreetly to the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs that I would be happy to ascertain whether the services of a
                            technical official of the Federal Reserve Bank would be available for a
                            short period if he thought that the employment of such an experienced
                            expert would be of advantage to the Banco de la República del Uruguay.
                            His reply was that he personally favored the temporary employment, as
                            advisor, of one of our trained banking officials, but he thought that
                            the present political situation in the country would not permit
                            employment of foreigners.</p>
                        <p>There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Williams’ statements on the exchange
                            situation made a profound impression on the Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs, as well as on the Director of the Bank of the Republic. In that
                            respect his visit to Montevideo was an unqualified success.</p>
                        <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                            of American foreign exchange problems in certain South American

                            that the amount of exchange allocated by the Uruguayan Exchange Control
                            for imports from the United States is less than it should be because
                            exchange necessary for payment of petroleum products imported by
                            American companies from South American producing areas is charged to the
                            limited quota of exchange set aside by the control for imports of
                            American origin. Should your investigation show this complaint to be

                            pages 35 and 36 of the report<note n="21" xml:id="d636fn21"><ref

                                    421</ref>, fourth paragraph.</note> to inquire orally of the
                            appropriate authorities of the Uruguayan Government as to the maturity
                            of the new issue of amortizable obligations which it is understood will
                            be offered to foreign holders of blocked credits in Uruguay and to point
                            out informally, as being in Uruguay’s own interest, that their term
                            should be as limited as possible. The Department realizes that it may be
                            thought necessary to the Uruguayan program of orderly operation and
                            eventual liberation of exchange control to remove the pressure on the
                            exchanges of the present accumulation of frozen credits by spreading
                            their transfer over a certain period of time, but any attempt to fund
                            them into long term obligations would tend, it is believed, to defeat
                            this object. It would, besides, inflict unjustified further hardships
                            and losses on American holders of frozen credits in addition to those
                            already suffered as a result of Uruguayan control of exchange, whereas,
                            no restriction has been placed by this Government on remittances to
                            Uruguay. American subscribers to the amortizable obligations previously
                            issued by the Uruguayan Exchange Control have had no regular market or
                            facilities for discounting them <pb n="661" xml:id="pg_661" facs="0727"
                            />and if the proposed new issue should be of long term obligations, it
                            would be difficult, if not impossible, to create a satisfactory market
                            for their sale or discount under present conditions. It is anticipated
                            that, rather than accept possibly unmarketable long term obligations,
                            many holders of blocked balances would be forced to take the losses
                            which would be incurred by transferring their credits through the free
                            market.</p>
                        <p>The Department would appreciate receiving by air mail any comments or
                            expression of views which you may care to make on the matters treated in
                            the report. It would be helpful to the Department in its consideration
                            of the exchange problem if the Legation, in connection with the Consul
                            General in Montevideo, were to prepare a study of the balance of
                            payments between Uruguay and the United States in 1933 and an advance
                            estimate of the balance for 1934.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The importance of the removal of exchange
                            restrictions in Uruguay as an aid to the country’s international trade
                            led me to inquire of the Director of the Bank of the Republic, in the
                            course of a conversation which I had with him on October 15, as to
                            whether there existed any likelihood of a total return to free exchange
                            transactions in Uruguay. I have the honor to report that the Director
                            stated that every effort was now being exerted by the appropriate
                            agencies in Uruguay to reestablish the system of free exchange trade at
                            the earliest possible moment. According to him, each step taken in the
                            exchange control system adopted during the last two years constituted a
                            stage in approaching the goal of the total removal of exchange
                            restrictions. He stated that he now hoped that exchange control would be
                            totally removed in Uruguay in the course of the first six months of
                            1935, unless some unforeseen event should force its continuation.</p>
                        <p>In making this statement, however, the Director of the Bank stated that
                            control over importations would not be lifted as he, along with the
                            Government officials entrusted with the supervision of the import and
                            export trade were of the opinion that the control over imports recently
                            inaugurated would have to be maintained until complete economic recovery
                            of Uruguay had taken place and until they thought it necessary to
                            prevent the importation of articles which were deemed unnecessary,
                            although not classed as luxuries.</p>
                        <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0728"/>
                        <p>It would appear, therefore, that the difficulties with which exporters to
                            Uruguay have been contending would not disappear entirely with the
                            abolition of the exchange control system, but that the maintenance of a
                            restrictive supervision over imports to Uruguay might still be attended
                            by hindrances of the order which have been experienced lately in
                            connection with exchange problems.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Department’s instruction
                            no. 287 of October 5 requesting that an investigation be made of the
                            complaint that the amount of exchange allocated by the Uruguayan
                            exchange control for imports from the United States is less than it
                            should be because exchange for petroleum products, imported by American
                            companies from South American producing areas, is charged to the quota
                            of exchange set aside by the exchange control authorities for imports of
                            American origin, I have the honor to inform the Department that this
                            complaint was the subject of discussion in 1933 and during the spring of
                            1934 between the Chairman of the Commerce Committee of the American
                            Association of Uruguay, which association acts as the American Chamber
                            of Commerce of Uruguay, and the Director of the Bank of the Republic
                            which institution is vested with the control of exchange. According to
                            figures compiled by the American Association of Uruguay on the basis of
                            Uruguayan statistics, the American quota of exchange for 1933 includes
                            the amount of $1,816, 195 in payment of petroleum products practically
                            no part of which was considered to have originated in the United States.
                            This amount is part of a total of $10,441,019 allocated to the United
                            States as dollar exchange in 1933 by the Uruguayan exchange
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the above mentioned discussion, the Bank justified its
                            policy, of charging exchange given in payment of petroleum products
                            handled by American companies in Uruguay to the United States exchange
                            quota, on the ground that such products were handled, financed,
                            transported and sold by American companies which, by engaging in the
                            business, obtained the major part of the profit resulting from the
                            operations.</p>
                        <p>It appears that during the first six months of 1934 the American oil
                            companies operating in Uruguay received $702,000 at the official rate.
                            Whether these companies will continue to receive exchange at <pb n="663"
                                xml:id="pg_663" facs="0729"/>the official rate is not known in view
                            of the intention of the Government to restrict the granting of official
                            exchange to Government purchases only. It is understood that the oil
                            companies would be satisfied if they could continue obtaining exchange
                            at the so-called compensated rate of exchange which is an intermediary
                            rate between the official and the free rate and is worth slightly more
                            than the latter. However, there is nothing to warrant belief in the
                            continuation of the awarding of exchange at rates other than the free
                            rate, as the present tendency of the Uruguayan exchange control office
                            is to direct exchange transactions into the free market. If, eventually,
                            the oil companies obtain exchange at the free rate only, the cost of oil
                            products will increase in Uruguay.</p>
                        <p>The determination of the amount of that portion of exchange, in the quota
                            allotted to American interests, which represents payment for oil derived
                            from non-American territory, is stated to be complicated. It appears
                            that the origin of the oil supplied to Uruguay by American companies
                            varies from month to month according to the dictates of the commercial
                            and economic convenience of the companies interested. The preliminary
                            figures of exchange allotment by countries for the month of September,
                            1934, indicate that out of a total of $171,708.64 allotted to American
                            exporters there was included about $94,000 for petroleum products. The
                            quantity of petroleum emanating from fields in the United States
                            included in that total is known only to the petroleum companies which do
                            not give out their statistics or information as the particular phase of
                            the exchange problem, considered in this despatch, is one in which they
                            are not interested. It is not unlikely, however, that the Uruguayan
                            customs statistics may contain data on the quantity of oil of
                            non-American provenience imported by American companies.</p>
                        <p>The Texas Oil Company claims to be the only American oil company whose
                            exports to Uruguay are of American origin. The other American oil
                            companies appear satisfied with receiving dollar exchange for the total
                            amount of their imports into Uruguay. Their business may be seriously
                            jeopardized if they are unable to continue receiving dollar exchange for
                            all the products they sell in Uruguay. The complaint that dollar
                            exchange provided for oil products of non-American provenience is part
                            of the quota assigned to the United States emanates from American
                            exporters who do not deal in oil products. Their viewpoint differs from
                            that of the oil companies, thus giving rise to two distinct, and
                            possibly opposing, currents of ideas on the subject.</p>
                        <p>The difficulties inherent to the determination of the value of oil of
                            strictly American origin may have been taken into account by the
                            Commerce Committee of the American Association of Uruguay after <pb
                                n="664" xml:id="pg_664" facs="0730"/>its discussions last spring
                            with the Bank of the Republic as the subject appears to have been
                            dropped until the arrival of Dr. Williams in Montevideo last July.
                            Neither does it appear to have been considered subsequently in the form
                            of a formal complaint.</p>
                        <p>In view of the existence of apparently divergent viewpoints in the two
                            groups of American exporters consisting respectively of exporters of oil
                            and its products and of exporters of commodities other than petroleum
                            products, and, moreover, in view of the possibility of the removal of
                            exchange control indicated in my despatch No. 794 of October 17, 1934,
                            it is submitted respectfully that representations be made only after
                            formal complaint has been received at the Department or the Legation
                            from legitimate importing interests, if conditions existing at the time
                            of the receipt of such complaints warrant the representations being made
                            without general prejudice to American interests.</p>

                            I have the honor, in pursuance of the above, to enclose herewith a
                            preliminary report<note n="22" xml:id="d639fn2">Not printed.</note>
                            prepared by Vice Consul Lippincott, who has been detailed to the
                            Legation pending the arrival of Mr. Paul J. Gray, recently assigned as
                            Third Secretary.</p>
                        <p>It may be noted from the report that the adverse balance of payments
                            which characterizes Uruguay in its economic relations with the United
                            States is gradually being reduced, as it has decreased from over
                            $4,000,000 U. S. currency in 1933 to an estimated amount of a little
                            over $1,000,000 U. S. currency for the year just about to end. Lack of
                            precise information regarding the items which enter into the
                            determination of the balance of payments prevents these figures from
                            representing more than an approximation. As such, however, it is
                            believed that they indicate, with fair accuracy, the present
                            situation.</p>
