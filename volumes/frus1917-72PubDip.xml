                <head>About the Series</head>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major foreign policy decisions and
                    significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government. The Historian
                    of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The staff of
                    the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, under the direction of
                    the General Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series,
                    plans, researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. Secretary of
                    State Frank B. Kellogg first promulgated official regulations codifying specific
                    standards for the selection and editing of documents for the series on March 26,
                    1925. These regulations, with minor modifications, guided the series through
                    1991.</p>
                <p>Public Law 102–138, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, established a new
                    statutory charter for the preparation of the series, which was signed by
                    President George H.W. Bush on October 28, 1991. Section 198 of P.L. 102–138
                    added a new Title IV to the Department of State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956
                    (22 U.S.C. 4351, et seq.).</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government.
                    The statute also confirms the editing principles established by Secretary
                    Kellogg: the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the
                    principles of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered
                    or deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has
                    been made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major
                    importance in reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the
                    purposes of concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than
                    30 years after the events recorded. The editors are convinced that this volume
                    meets all regulatory, statutory, and scholarly standards of selection and
                    editing.</p>

                <p>The Foreign Relations statute requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation of major <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                        >U.S.</gloss> foreign policy decisions and significant <gloss
                        target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> diplomatic activity. It further requires that
                        govern<pb n="IV" facs="0006" xml:id="pg_IV"/>ment agencies, departments, and
                    other entities of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government engaged in
                    foreign policy formulation, execution, or support cooperate with the Department
                    of State historians by providing full and complete access to records pertinent
                    to foreign policy decisions and actions and by providing copies of selected
                    records. Most of the sources consulted in the preparation of this volume have
                    been declassified and are available for review at the National Archives and
                    Records Administration (Archives II), in College Park, Maryland.</p>
                <p>The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series have complete
                    access to all the retired records and papers of the Department of State: the
                    central files of the Department; the special decentralized files (“lot files”)
                    of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files of the
                    Department’s Executive Secretariat, which contain the records of international
                    conferences and high-level official visits, correspondence with foreign leaders
                    by the President and Secretary of State, and the memoranda of conversations
                    between the President and the Secretary of State and foreign officials; and the
                    files of overseas diplomatic posts. All of the Department’s central files are
                    available in electronic or microfilm formats at Archives II, and may be accessed
                    using the Access to Archival Databases (AAD) tool. Almost all of the
                    Department’s decentralized office files covering this period, which the National
                    Archives deems worthy of permanent retention, have been transferred to or are in
                    the process of being transferred from the Department’s custody to Archives
                    II.</p>
                <p>Research for <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes is undertaken
                    through special access to restricted documents at the presidential libraries and
                    other agencies. While all the material printed in this volume has been
                    declassified, some of it is extracted from still-classified documents. The staff
                    of each presidential library is processing and declassifying many of the
                    documents used in this volume, but they may not be available in their entirety
                    at the time of publication. Presidential papers maintained and preserved at the
                    presidential libraries include some of the most significant foreign-affairs
                    related documentation from White House offices, the Department of State, and
                    other federal agencies including the National Security Council, the Central
                    Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense, and the Joint Chiefs of
                    Staff.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Editorial Methodology</p>
                <p>The documents in this volume are presented chronologically according to
                    Washington time. Memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                        guid<pb n="V" facs="0007" xml:id="pg_V"/>ance from the General Editor and
                    the Chief of the Editing and Publishing Division. The documents are reproduced
                    as exactly as possible, including marginalia or other notations, which are
                    described in the footnotes. Texts are transcribed and printed according to
                    accepted conventions for the publication of historical documents within the
                    limitations of modern typography. A heading has been supplied by the editors for
                    each document included in this volume. Spelling, capitalization, and punctuation
                    are retained as found in the original text, except that obvious typographical
                    errors are silently corrected. Other mistakes and omissions in documents are
                    corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction is set in italic type; an
                    addition in roman type. Words and phrases underlined in the source text are
                    printed in italics. Abbreviations and contractions are preserved as found in the
                    original text, and a list of abbreviations is included in the front matter of
                    each volume.</p>
                <p>Bracketed insertions are also used to indicate omitted text that deals with an
                    unrelated subject (in roman type) or that remains classified after
                    declassification review (in italic type). The amount and, where possible, the
                    nature of the material not declassified has been noted by indicating the number
                    of lines or pages of text that were omitted. Entire documents withheld for
                    declassification purposes have been accounted for and are listed with headings,
                    source notes, and number of pages not declassified in their chronological place.
                    All brackets that appear in the original text are so identified in footnotes.
                    All ellipses are in the original documents.</p>
                <p>The first footnote to each document indicates the source of the document,
                    original classification, distribution, and drafting information. This note also
                    provides the background of important documents and policies and indicates
                    whether the President or his major policy advisers read the document.</p>
                <p>Editorial notes and additional annotation summarize pertinent material not
                    printed in the volume, indicate the location of additional documentary sources,
                    provide references to important related documents printed in other volumes,
                    describe key events, and provide summaries of and citations to public statements
                    that supplement and elucidate the printed documents. Information derived from
                    memoirs and other first-hand accounts has been used when appropriate to
                    supplement or explicate the official record.</p>
                <p>The numbers in the index refer to document numbers rather than to page
                    numbers.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic
                    Documentation</p>
                <p>The Advisory Committee on Historical Diplomatic Documentation, established under
                    the Foreign Relations statute, reviews records, <pb n="VI" facs="0008"
                        xml:id="pg_VI"/>advises, and makes recommendations concerning the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series. The Advisory Committee monitors
                    the overall compilation and editorial process of the series and advises on all
                    aspects of the preparation and declassification of the series. The Advisory
                    Committee does not necessarily review the contents of individual volumes in the
                    series, but it makes recommendations on issues that come to its attention and
                    reviews volumes as it deems necessary to fulfill its advisory and statutory
                    obligations.</p>
                <p rend="sectiontitleital">Declassification Review</p>
                <p>The Office of Information Programs and Services, Bureau of Administration,
                    conducted the declassification review for the Department of State of the
                    documents published in this volume. The review was conducted in accordance with
                    the standards set forth in Executive Order 13526 on Classified National Security
                    Information and applicable laws.</p>
                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security as embodied in law
                    and regulation. Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the
                    appropriate geographic and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other
                    concerned agencies of the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government, and
                    the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific documents of those
                    governments. The declassification review of this compilation, which began in
                    December 2013 and was completed in March 2014, resulted in the decision to
                    withhold 0 documents in full, excise a paragraph or more in 0 documents, and
                    make minor excisions of less than a paragraph in 0 documents.</p>
                <p>The Office of the Historian is confident, on the basis of the research conducted
                    in preparing this compilation and as a result of the declassification review
                    process described above, that the documentation and editorial notes presented
                    here provide a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of public diplomacy
                    initiatives during World War I.</p>

                        Relations</hi> volumes 30 years after the events that they cover mean that
                    compilations in this volume have been researched and compiled piecemeal over a
                    longer period of time than the typical <hi rend="italic">FRUS</hi> volume.
                    Fortunately, progress is being made, as evidenced by this compilation, which
                    covers the <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government’s public diplomacy
                    efforts from 1917 to 1919. Subsequent compilations, which will document up to
                    the end of the first Nixon administration, will be published as they are
                    completed.</p>
                <p>This compilation focuses on the creation and overseas work of the Committee on
                    Public Information (<gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>). While the <gloss
                        target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> Government had engaged in public diplomacy
                    before (such as with the publication of diplomatic correspondence during the
                    Civil War), the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>’s overseas work constituted
                    a sustained effort to educate a foreign public about the United States, and, in
                    particular, its role in the war effort. Representatives of the <gloss
                        target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> were sent around the globe to establish
                    reading rooms, distribute translated copies of President <persName
                        corresp="#p_WW_1">Woodrow Wilson</persName>’s speeches, work with local
                    journalists to publish news stories, and show films demonstrating the United
                    States’ readiness to fight. This compilation documents all of these activities.
                    While few planning documents from the time exist, this compilation includes
                    numerous examples of how the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> executed its
                    work in the field, particularly in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The chapter
                    also includes examples of the types of information distributed by the <gloss
                        target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>. The inclusion of these multimedia items is a
                    new milestone in the publication history of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series. Despite the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>’s
                    extensive activity, the war’s conclusion led the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                        >U.S.</gloss> Government to shut down the Committee. However, future <gloss
                        target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> public diplomacy efforts could call upon the
                        <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> as an example, even though it left no
                    sustained bureaucratic legacy.</p>

                <p>The Committee on Public Information (<gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>) had
                    both a foreign and domestic function. Records on the foreign function of the
                        <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> are not extensive, but the National
                    Archives and Records Administration has two record groups of primary interest.
                    Record Group 63 contains the records of the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1"
                    >CPI</gloss>, which include director <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">George
                        Creel</persName>’s correspondence. The 1910–1929 Central Decimal File in
                    Record Group 59, the General Records of the Department of State, also includes
                        <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> information in decimal files 103.93 and
                    103.9302.</p>
                <p>At the Library of Congress, the private papers of <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                        >George Creel</persName> do not offer extensive discussion of the foreign
                    work of the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>, although there is some
                    material on the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>’s founding. The Papers of
                        <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Woodrow Wilson</persName> offer key insights
                    into the founding of the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> and <persName
                        corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName>’s stance on its work. Many of these
                    documents have been reprinted in the comprehensive <hi rend="italic">Papers of
                            <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Woodrow Wilson</persName>
                    </hi> published by Princeton University Press. Another key printed work is the
                        <hi rend="italic">Complete Report of the Chairman of the Committee on Public
                        Information</hi>, which gives a thorough summation of the <gloss

                        discussed the need for what would become the Committee on Public Information

                        about censorship. He will appoint <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">George

                        on the need for a domestic publicity service that would include a censorship

                            >Daniels</persName>: “Do I understand that I now have the authority to

                        glad to do so. I like his memorandum very much.” (Ibid., page 43)</p>
                    <p>The formal request for the creation of the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1"
                            >CPI</gloss> came in a letter to <persName corresp="#p_WW_1"
                            >Wilson</persName> dated April 13 from Secretary of State <persName
                            corresp="#p_LR_1">Robert Lansing</persName>, Secretary of War <persName

                            corresp="#p_DJ_1">Daniels</persName>. According to White House staff
                        member Thomas Brahany, the letter was “drafted by <persName
                            corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName> after consultation with the
                        President.” Brahany also noted some disagreement between <persName

                        by <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> and <persName
                            corresp="#p_DJ_1">Daniels</persName>, with whom he had talked fully,
                            <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName> was very coolly received.
                            <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Lansing</persName> insisted that the letter
                        be written on a State Department letterhead, and that his signature appear
                        above the signatures of <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> and
                            <persName corresp="#p_DJ_1">Daniels</persName>. <persName
                            corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName> didn’t want <persName

                        be added. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName> was disgusted with
                        what he termed <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Lansing</persName>’s ‘petty

                            corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName> said, when he told them they would
                        have to sign a second letter because <persName corresp="#p_LR_1"
                            >Lansing</persName> wanted his name to appear first.” (Diary entry of

                        also commented on the incident: “<persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                            >Creel</persName> went to L to sign letter whereupon L wanted it written

                    <p>As with <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName>’s memorandum, the focus
                        of the letter was on the domestic work of the organization. The three men
                        argued:</p>
                    <p>“It is our opinion that the two functions—censorship and publicity—can be
                        joined in honesty and with profit, and we recommend the<pb n="2" facs="0022"
                            xml:id="pg_2"/> creation of a Committee on Public Information. The
                        Chairman should be a civilian, preferably some writer of proved courage,
                        ability and vision, able to gain the understanding cooperation of the press
                        and at the same time rally the authors of the country to a work of service.
                        Other members should be the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and
                        the Secretary of the Navy, or an officer or officers detailed to the work by
                        them.” (Ibid., page 55)</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName> authorized the creation of the
                            <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> that same day in Executive Order
                        2594, appointing the Secretaries of State, War, and the Navy as members of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss> and <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                            >Creel</persName> as the head. (Ibid., page 59) The Committee apparently
                        met only once. In an undated note, <persName corresp="#p_CG_2"
                            >Creel</persName> wrote:</p>
                    <p>“Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Lansing</persName>, a dull, small man,
                        bitterly resented my chairmanship of the Committee, and made himself so
                        unpleasant at the first meeting that I never called another. As a
                        consequence, he refused to work with the Committee, and did everything that
                        he could, in his mean, cheap way, to hinder and embarrass.” The undated note
                        is a typed addition to an excerpt of a letter from <persName
                            corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName> to <persName corresp="#p_LR_1"
                            >Lansing</persName> dated June 29; the note is bound in a volume of
                        collected letters with an introductory note dated March 21, 1931. (Library

                        on Public Information, 1917–1931, Box 3, Vol. III, 1917–1918, 1931)</p>
                    <p>Although foreign work was apparently not part of the original conception of
                        the <gloss target="#t_CPI_1">CPI</gloss>, in time the Committee would assume
                        responsibility for distributing material in allied, enemy, and neutral
                        territories abroad, as <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName> and his
                        administration were soon urged to consider publicity work in foreign
                        countries. Ambassador on Special Mission to Russia <persName
                            corresp="#p_RE_1">Elihu Root</persName> wrote to <persName
                            corresp="#p_LR_1">Lansing</persName> from St. Petersburg on June 17 that
                        conditions in Russia were “critical.” He elaborated: “The soldiers do not
                        understand at all the importance to their country of maintaining the war and
                        all along the line have simply been unwilling to fight. [Demoralization] has
                        been aided by a tremendous German propaganda through fraternization of
                        troops at the front and thousands of German agents throughout the country
                        who swarmed across the border immediately after the revolution.” <persName
                            corresp="#p_RE_1">Root</persName> notified <persName corresp="#p_LR_1"
                            >Lansing</persName> that he was already beginning to distribute
                        “information” and had spent $100,000 for that purpose. He urged the
                        expenditure of “at least $5,000,000” and gave the following
                        justification:</p>
                    <p>“That would be less than the cost of maintaining five American regiments and
                        the chance of keeping 5,000,000 Russians in the field against Germany is
                        worth many times five regiments. It will mean a supply of newspapers,
                        printing and distribution of posters, leaflets and pamphlets, employment of
                        numerous lecturers and moving pictures to go about the front. This work to
                        be done with the approval of Russian Government and not to be conducted in
                        the name of the United States. <pb n="3" facs="0023" xml:id="pg_3"/>We
                        particularly recommend the establishment upon the Russian front of <gloss
                            target="#t_YMCA_1">Y.M.C.A.</gloss> stations similar to those on the
                        French and English fronts, until recently on the Austrian front, just
                        beginning on the Italian front, and in Mesopotamia, and along the lines
                        planned for the American Army as authorized in Executive order signed by the
                        President on April 27, 1917. These establishments have reading rooms,
                        provisions for reading aloud to illiterate soldiers, lecture rooms, and
                        temporary arrangements for moving pictures. There are two thousand of these
                        establishments with the British Army all thronged by soldiers. They afford
                        opportunities for access to the minds of the soldiers. These should be
                        financed by the United States but that fact probably not made public until
                        after they are established and understood. <persName corresp="#p_MJR_1"
                            >Mott</persName> thinks he can obtain twenty Americans now in Europe to
                        inaugurate plan promptly pending the securing and training adequate number.
                        Same sort of work is now being done on considerable scale in prison camps
                        with great success. Very desirable indeed to send here immediately as many
                        moving pictures as possible showing American preparation for war,
                        battleships, troops marching, factories making munitions, and other things
                        to carry to the mind the idea that America is doing something. These poor
                        fellows have been told that no one is really fighting except Russian
                        soldiers and they believe it. The British have recently been sending out
                        similar moving pictures with very good effect, but everything has been done
                        on too small a scale to deal with the great masses of people who must be
                        assimilated.” (Telegram 8; <ref target="frus1918Russiav01">

                    </opener>
                    <p>I have just reread the interview with <persName corresp="#p_RCE_1">Charles
                            Edward Russell</persName> in the New York Times of last Sunday.<note
                            n="2" xml:id="d2fn2">“Russia Today,” <hi rend="italic">New York
                                Times</hi>, August 12, 1917, p. X1.</note> One paragraph especially
                        appeals to me:</p>
                    <quote>“Observe, now, the really critical point today is the security of the
                        Russian line on the eastern front; take note next of the great fact almost
                        universally overlooked in this country that the security of that Russian
                        line depends solely upon the state of mind of the masses of the Russian
                        people. Then, if you convince the masses of the people that the United
                        States is not really in this war, that it will not prosecute it with vigor
                        and resolution, that it is divided in its councils, that it is really
                        seeking peace, you have done more to make that Russian line melt away than
                        the Kaiser could do with ten million men and ten times as much artillery as
                        he has now.”</quote>
                    <p>Just the other day I talked with an experienced observer recently returned
                        from Russia. He said he had talked with a great many Russians and that their
                        expressed opinion was that the United States had made fabulous sums out of
                        the war and now had entered into it to be in position to share the spoils.
                        Not a single Russian that he had spoken with was familiar with the events
                        and the line of thought that had led to our participation in the war. This
                        tragic situation is only partly due to German propaganda; it is still more
                        due to our own blindness and to our inability or unwillingness to realize
                        that we have no case unless our case reaches the attention of the masses of
                        the world. The Russians are not to blame. We state our case in Washington;
                        then innocently expect the Moscow papers to have the story the next day!
                        “Papers everywhere, please copy,” seems to be our motto.</p>
                    <p>It can not be said too often or too loudly that this war is being fought out
                        in the minds of great masses of people as truly as it is being fought out on
                        the battle fields of Europe. Stating our case, convincing the world that we
                        mean business and that we stand for the common rights of men, is just as
                        important a piece of work as that being done <pb n="5" facs="0025"

                    <p>Presenting our case to the world is no small job, it requires the same high
                        degree of brains, technical skill and energy as goes into the actual
                        prosecution of the war in its military aspects.</p>
                    <p>I am aghast at the situation. Take my own case. I went to China and Japan to
                        learn what people there thought of us and to acquaint myself with Oriental
                        newspaper and press association methods. I found that something drastic
                        ought to be done at once to checkmate unfriendly propaganda and to get the
                        American case presented. China was drifting into chaos. China needed news
                        and truth from America. None was forthcoming—only German, Japanese and
                        British selfishly directed propaganda. The American Minister<note n="4"
                            xml:id="d2fn4">Paul S. Reinsch.</note> clearly saw the situation and
                        desired me to impress on Washington the urgency.</p>
                    <p>I reported to <gloss target="#t_Col_1">Col.</gloss>
                        <persName corresp="#p_HEC_1">House</persName>. He sent me to the State
                        Department. Now I have been about the world and have had considerable
                        journalistic, political and commercial experience. I think I qualify as a
                        trained investigator. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Lansing</persName> was
                        too busy to see me. I have been home three months, have been in and out of
                        the Department any number of times, but have not talked with the Secretary
                        yet. I went to the Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs. The Chief of the
                            Bureau<note n="5" xml:id="d2fn5">Edward T. Williams.</note> inquired
                        about the weather, hotels and railroads, but asked me not a single question
                        regarding conditions. I then turned to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PFL_1"
                            >Polk</persName>, who gave me ten minutes and agreed to give
                        consideration to certain suggestions. I then turned to Mr. <persName
                            corresp="#p_PPH_1">Patchin</persName>, head of the Bureau of
                        Information. We had several short talks. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PPH_1"
                            >Patchin</persName> thought that possibly I wanted a job under him!
                            <persName corresp="#p_PPH_1">Patchin</persName> partially has the idea,
                        but is not a great person and has no independent authority.</p>
                    <p>Consider just two questions: What would be the situation now had the
                        President’s communications to the belligerents been actually printed
                        textually throughout the world? We are making an appeal to the good sense
                        and honor of the world, but most of the world has never had a chance to read
                        our state papers!</p>
                    <p>One of these days a peace conference will be held. Will America be looked
                        upon by South America, the Orient and Russia (not to mention the rest) as
                        standing unselfishly for human rights? Or will America be considered merely
                        as a butt-in-sky with a greedy appetite? Our <pb n="6" facs="0026"
                            xml:id="pg_6"/>standing at the peace conference, the measure of our
                        influence, will depend largely upon what the world believes of us.</p>
                    <p>Of course, German propaganda will try to muss everything up, scatter dust
                        about and blind the eyes. Of course, Japanese propaganda will not forget
                        Nipponese aspirations. As to British propaganda—the late cock-of-the-walk is
                        out to regain its lost prestige; for seventy-five years the British
                        dominated the Orient because of the belief that they could lick the world
                        any afternoon; now the British are not going to let the world believe that
                        we are playing a decisive role and that we are the upholders of liberty. We
                        preach our own message—democracy’s story—or it isn’t told.</p>
                    <p>I believe the President perceives this situation. I believe we have no
                        greater problem or obligation. Personally I do not believe this task can be
                        handled by the State Department; the Department is not suitably manned or
                        organized. A year ago last June I went to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_LR_1"
                            >Lansing</persName> and told him of the South American service
                        inaugurated by the United Press—I knew all about it as, in a sense, it was
                        my scheme—and suggested that the Department take advantage of this new
                        service to explain systematically our attitude and actions. The Secretary
                        told me in so many words that it was not one of the functions of the
                        Department to see that the American case was presented to the peoples of
                        other countries.</p>
                    <p>The President or the Department carefully prepares a statement intended to
                        clarify a situation or to make us friends—the dissemination of that
                        statement is not a matter of official concern! The dissemination is as
                        important as the document. I thought we wrote documents and prepared
                        statements with a view to getting results and not merely for filing purposes
                        in official archives! I have never been a diplomat.</p>
                    <p>I see no signs of the Department getting the big idea. Certain things are
                        being done grudgingly and parsimoniously. It is laugh-stuff to find the
                        Department felicitating itself upon the idea of sending a million post cards
                        to Russia—and a moving picture film too for good measure. From any big view
                        of the task, such things are merely incidental details.</p>
                    <p>We have got to organize to spread the teachings and the purposes of our
                        democracy and to show that democracy is a real thing that can have character
                        and direction.</p>
                    <p>The undertaking is huge. One can not map out a policy, submit blue-prints or
                        accurate estimates of cost. It is a new job which must be done under
                        war-time conditions.</p>
                    <p>Would that the President might give this opportunity to some experienced man,
                        make him virtually independent of the State Department and turn him loose to
                        do his best?</p>

                    <p>To me our conversation with the President was not entirely satisfactory.<note

                        details. The President was tired. The problem of world wide publicity
                        requires a broad consideration and then the leaving of details to
                        experts.</p>

                        Department of State to conduct propaganda in Russia. On July 2, 1917,
                        Mission member Samuel Bertron wrote from St. Petersburg to Secretary of the
                        Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo at noon: “It is the unanimous opinion of
                        commission that an extensive educational publicity campaign be undertaken in
                        Russia with the approval of Russian Government and to be supervised by
                        Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_FDR_1">Francis</persName> in order to
                        offset extensive and very dangerous German propaganda. This is absolutely
                        essential in our judgment and even though costly is the best possible
                        contribution that America can make.” (Telegram 12; <ref

                            >Root</persName> wrote from St. Petersburg: “I beg you to realize that

                        least a million dollars monthly, to capture the minds of the Russian people.
                        Germany expects to succeed; can be prevented only by active and immediate
                        counter attacks by the same weapons.” (Telegram 13; ibid., pages

                    <p>“With regard to administration, I do not think that the State Department
                        should have anything to do with it at all. The work lies entirely within the
                        province of the Committee on Public Information, and would be merely an
                        extension of activities already under way. I have not included Russia in my
                        foreign campaign out of a desire to learn the findings of the <persName
                            corresp="#p_RE_1">Root</persName> Commission, but with its work
                        concluded, I see no reason for further delay.</p>
                    <p>“While not yet ready to present a detailed plan, it is my thought to ask
                            <persName corresp="#p_RCE_1">Charles Edward Russell</persName> to act
                        for the Committee in Russia. He knows more about the Russian situation than
                        any other, and in addition to his sympathy and understanding, he is one of
                        the best newspapermen in the country and a writer of rare ability.” (<hi

                        film which creates race prejudice is distinctly objectionable at this time
                        in our international relations. I shall be greatly obliged if you will take
                        such steps as you may deem expedient and advisable to suppress the ‘Curse of
                        Iku’ or any other film which you may have reason to believe is prejudicial
                        to the foreign relations of this country.” (Ibid.)</p>
                    <p>On August 30, <persName corresp="#p_LR_1">Lansing</persName> sent another
                        telegram to Stephens: “[F]urther investigation develops that the film ‘Curse
                        of Iku’ is ‘Her White God’, for which picture the censor at Chicago denied
                        an exhibition permit. Vigorous protest was made against the picture by the
                        Japanese Consulate at Chicago. Subsequently the producers exhibited the film
                        to representatives of the Japanese Embassy here and the Department of State.
                        The film was found to be distinctly objectionable and the producers agreed
                        to eliminate certain scenes before showing the picture. It appears that
                        these modifications have not been made or if they have been made they have
                        not been sufficient to remove the objectionable features from the picture.
                        The change of name of the picture to the ‘Curse of Iku’ does not in any way
                        modify the attitude of the Japanese Embassy or of the Department. The action
                        of the producers in showing this film in San Francisco at this or any other
                        time deserves the severest condemnation and it is earnestly hoped that you
                        may find means to suppress the picture.” (Ibid.)</p>

                    <p>1. Three methods of propaganda are being employed in this country at the
                        present time: publications, cinema and personal advocacy.</p>
                    <p>2. Propaganda by publication takes two forms—periodicals and pamphlets.</p>
                    <p>The periodicals are divisible into secular and Catholic press.</p>
                    <p>These papers are published in all the large cities, and even in towns which
                        less thorough campaigners than the Germans might unwisely consider small
                        enough to be overlooked.</p>
                    <p>Despite the high percentage of illiteracy, these papers have a very great
                        influence in moulding the opinion of the people of Spain; what is written is
                        read by those who can read, and recounted to those who cannot, and the
                        printed word is given a credence in this country which it does not enjoy
                        among better educated, and therefore more critical, peoples.</p>
                    <p>By those periodicals which are enlisted on the German side,—and unhappily
                        this means, by most of the newspapers of Spain, both secular and
                        Catholic,—the opinion of the people of Spain is being shaped up, without
                        regard to domestic politics or religion, to oppose the Allies. To cultivate
                        this opposition no appeal is left unmade; readers in southern Spain are
                        eternally reminded that the English took and kept Gibraltar; readers in
                        northern Spain are eternally reminded of what was suffered during the
                        Napoleonic invasion; readers in all Spain are not permitted to forget that
                        it was the Americans who bereft Spain of the last of her colonial glory.
                        Catholics are incited against the heretic English, against the godless
                        French, and the gross materialistic Yankee, without any regard whatsoever
                        for truth, or even the common decencies of language.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, Spaniards who know no better are permitted to believe that
                        the Kaiser and most of Germany anyhow, are Catholic; or at least, even
                        though Lutheran, they are deeply religious—and now defending the sacred
                        fires of spirituality against a sordid horde of the heathen. Incredible as
                        it may seem, these views are actually taught!</p>
                    <p>3. Against all this the Allies have offered little or no defense by
                        counter-propaganda in publication. The idea seems to have been that <pb
                            n="11" facs="0031" xml:id="pg_11"/>the German campaign was too crude,
                        and too wholly based on falsity, to succeed. A somewhat similar campaign of
                        deception and vicious untruth did fail, for instance, in the United States,
                        but the standard of education and information there is far higher than in
                        Spain. In Spain, it has succeeded.</p>
                    <p>4. Which is not to say that there are not excellent periodicals in Spain
                        which champion the Allies’ cause,—such papers as La Correspondencia de
                        Espana, and El Liberal—which represent the best journalistic thought of
                        Spain, and have taken their stand because of that fact. Similarly, in the
                        free forum of the Ateneo of Madrid, only the other night, a member of
                        parliament was not afraid to inform his hearers that the Allies are fighting
                        for the rights of humanity, not afraid to attack Germany by name, nor to
                        denounce militarism there, and in Spain, not to urge this country to enter
                        the war on the Allies’ side for her honor and for her future’s sake. Such
                        papers and such speakers, nevertheless, are the minority.</p>
                    <p>5. The majority in Spain are pro-German—the aristocracy out of respect to
                        their own interests, and the rest, out of ignorance and misconception
                        fostered very largely by the pro-German press, secular and especially
                        Catholic.</p>
                    <p>6. It has been said that the Allies should not attempt to remedy this
                        situation because the enemy has been working a long time and has succeeded
                        in fixing the views of the people permanently against us, so that to combat
                        their propaganda now would be a waste of effort.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not such an effort would, or could possibly bring in adequate
                        returns is a question which rests upon two premises; one, whether Spain
                        could be induced or seduced into entering this war against the Allies, and,
                        the other, whether if Spain did go in against us, she could injure the
                        Allies seriously.</p>
                    <p>7. Those who seriously declare that there is no use in our making an effort
                        to combat the enemy’s propaganda, also assert that it is impossible for
                        Spain to enter the war against the Allies, and that even if she did, she
                        could not put up more than a feeble fight.</p>
                    <p>As for myself, I am of a contrary opinion, viz., of the opinion that Spain
                        can enter the war against us, and that, if she does, it will be a serious
                        matter for the Allies.</p>
                    <p>8. Therefore, it is my opinion that we should make an effort to combat the
                        propaganda being carried on by the enemy in the newspapers of Spain.</p>
                    <p>9. I believe that we should by all means do so, because if Spain enters the
                        war on the side of the enemy, it will be that Spain is convinced that the
                        enemy is winning, and to bring this conviction home to Spain, and to obtain
                        the consequent result, is the very object of much of the enemy’s printed
                        propaganda.</p>
                    <pb n="12" facs="0032" xml:id="pg_12"/>
                    <p>It is the object of all the articles setting forth the prowess of the
                        invincible German army, the economic and industrial strength of that
                        inexhaustible country, lauding the morale of the people, and the unbroken
                        Christian spirit of its leaders. It is the object of all those other
                        articles picturing England as starved and frightened by U-boats, France as
                        prostrate, Russia in anarchy, Italy defeated and the United States too far
                        away and too careful of her own interests to become of any account
                        whatsoever in this war. These preachments are laid before the Spaniard every
                        day, or twice a day, in his daily paper, for which he has a very great
                        respect; so that it is no marvel that most Spaniards have come to believe
                        these things to be true. If they are true, he argues, then the Allies are
                        defeated, Germany wins; further—following what is the best of the Spanish
                        mind,—it would therefore be very advisable for him to ally himself quickly
                        with the winner that he may at least avoid the victor’s wrath that he has
                        not done so sooner. (One hears this line of argument set forth daily by
                        Spaniards—and sometimes one hears it denounced by other Spaniards who
                        understand, and lament, but never deny, their race’s modes of
                        reasoning!)</p>
                    <p>10. I have not mentioned the importance of propaganda from the commercial
                        point of view. I have heard everywhere, from Spaniards and from English
                        themselves, that “the Spanish hate the English”. They are being trained to
                        hate the French as heartily. The Spaniard “remembers the Maine,”<note n="2"
                            xml:id="d5fn2">Reference is to the battleship USS <hi rend="italic"
                                >Maine</hi>, which exploded while at harbor in Havana on February
                            15, 1898, killing 266. Although Spain played no role in the explosion,
                            at the time the event helped solidify <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                                >U.S.</gloss> public opinion against Spain prior to the
                            Spanish-American War.</note> and yet, having a nearer object in
                        Gibraltar to remember against the English, and a larger number of points of
                        irritation between him and the French, he would presently forget the
                        Spanish-American war, if he were permitted to, and continue in increasingly
                        friendly relation with the United States,—if for no other reason than
                        because he hates the others worse! But the Germans do not propose to permit
                        the Spaniard to forget the Maine. The incident is dug up and aired in the
                        pro-German press at every opportunity; Spain is continually reminded that
                        the Yankees sought to “besmirch her honor with that base and baseless
                        charge.” And the second string to the enemy bow, as played against us, is
                        that we refused the mediation in this war of His Holiness.<note n="3"

                    <p>11. I do certainly believe that we should endeavor to prevent the enemy from
                        embittering the Spanish people against us, by a constant <pb n="13"
                            facs="0033" xml:id="pg_13"/>and determined harping upon these two
                        points, and upon our materialism, and our “picturesque” peculiarities.</p>
                    <p>It will pay us, strategically and commercially, not to permit ourselves to be
                        undone in this country by German lies and ridicule.</p>
                    <p>12. The Catholic press of Spain is a formidable influence. Newspapers
                        published with the approval of the church are preferred by the strictest
                        Catholics, and have easiest access to their homes. Although the church holds
                        itself responsible merely for the morals of such papers, it is quite certain
                        that these papers do not present military or political matters in a manner
                        offensive to the church authorities; and, in view of the distortions of fact
                        and the language employed by some such papers, it is amazing of what the
                        church in Spain can bring itself to approve.</p>
                    <p>13. I believe that we should bring to our side what Catholic papers we can.
                        Some of them would not cost much.<note n="4" xml:id="d5fn4">This sentence

                    </p>
                    <p>14. Propaganda by pamphlets, books, circulars, etc. exerts an influence when
                        conducted with intelligent consideration of the need of the occasion.</p>
                    <p>This office has been considering the possibility of reaching the Catholics
                        along these lines. The French have done something. I do not know what the
                        English are doing, except that I have heard they were sending out
                        publications that are not considered suitable for the masses of the people
                        here.</p>
                    <p>15. The French, the English and the Italian have engaged in propaganda work
                        by cinematograph. The films shown are not always war pictures.</p>
                    <p>16. I believe that it is possible for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFJ_1"
                            >Marion</persName> to do exceedingly good work here for us.</p>
                    <p>17. He has with him some excellent films, which, if shown throughout Spain,
                        and well advertised as American, could not fail to influence the opinion of
                        this country in our favor,—for, after all, Spain is ignorant because she has
                        poor facilities for information not because she is herself inert and
                        unthinking.</p>
                    <p>Take, for instance, one film Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MFJ_1"
                            >Marion</persName> has brought called “The Story of a Grain of Wheat”.
                        That film, which shows American agriculture, industry and commerce at its
                        best, would create nothing less than a sensation in the wheat-growing
                        regions of Castile, and I venture to assert that the Spaniard who saw it
                        would go from the show with some respect and admiration for a people who

                        would begin to germinate a notion that he would better not engage in
                        conflict with such a people.</p>
                    <p>18. Propaganda by personal advocacy. This is difficult for us because there
                        are few Americans in this country and those few not always of a desirable
                        type. Propaganda by personal relations has been most carefully developed by
                        the enemy; Germans mix with all classes of Spaniards and have got on
                        intimate terms with the people,—a thing which is difficult for a foreigner
                        as a rule.</p>
                    <p>I have thought that we might do a little along this line if we had here some
                        good American priests, patient and tactful, speaking Spanish well,—if
                        possible, even related to Spanish people in this country.</p>
                    <p>Some influence might be exerted among the intellectuals by professors of our
                        universities, if they were sent to visit Spain; but such visitors would need
                        to be of our finest,—educated, urbane, masters of Spanish language and
                        customs, and able to address critical audiences upon congenial topics. We
                        possess some such; there is here an opportunity for them to serve their
                        country.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary of State, any number of Senators, and practically every other
                        citizen interested in international affairs, deluge me from day to day with
                        the suggestion that we send to Russia men of Russian birth for the purpose
                        of explaining America’s meaning and purposes. I have not thought this wise
                        because the Russian situation changed so from day to day, and demanded such
                        extreme caution in every approach. I have now, however, a list of very
                        remarkable people that it might be well to send; men born in Russia,
                        successful Americans in every way, and able to write and speak
                        authoritatively. What do you think of sending them over?</p>
                    <p>Propaganda, of course, goes hand in hand with policy. It is impossible for me
                        to do very much in Russia or with Russians until certain decisions are
                            made.<note n="5" xml:id="d6fn5">The Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917

                        distress, to aid in restoration, and to build foundations under military
                        strength, but that this spirit of generous helpfulness can only be given

                        whole people, that has its source in democratic procedure, and its authority

                        <salute>My dear Mr. Fuller:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>I have just heard of an order issued by the Treasury Department at the
                        request of Mr. Oliphant, to the effect that all motion pictures going out of
                        the country should be censored by the Customs House Officers. As a result,
                        the shipments of American propaganda film to Scandinavia and Russia were
                        held up yesterday on the very eve of departure, and it has taken several
                        hours of my time to straighten out this infernal tangle.</p>
                    <p>Practically every foot of film made in the United States is censored by this
                        Department. Also, before leaving the United States, the consignees must
                        receive a license from the War Trade Board. By our arrangement, these men
                        have been referred to me, and with each of them I am making an arrangement
                        that permits me to pass upon the matter they are taking, but which also
                        gives me the right to make them take a certain amount of our propaganda film
                        with them for incorporation in every program.</p>
                    <p>For the Customs Officers to try to censor film is as impossible as it is
                        needless. Some of my shipments run from half a million feet to a million and
                        a half. Not only would projection rooms have to be provided, but it would
                        take a force of five men working day and night for a month to censor the
                        material. When one considers that it has already been censored, it will be
                        seen that the only result is confusion, expense and delay. Will you please
                        be kind enough to take this matter up at once, and have the order withdrawn
                        as far as New York is concerned at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Will you also give explicit orders that no motion picture license is to be
                        issued until the man has been referred to this Committee. This will prevent
                        the exportation of any film but that which has already been approved, and
                        will enable us to force our educational matter upon every exporter.<note

                    <p>I. That the United States has no other motive in waging war against the
                        German Government than to overthrow autocracy and to protect democracy from
                        the intrigue and physical might which threatens it.</p>
                    <p>II. That it is folly to believe that the United States would give thousands
                        of lives and expend billions of dollars in prosecution of a war for
                        commercial advantages, which, even without considering the loss of life and
                        the consequent weakening of the industrial power of the republic, could not

                    <p>III. That the United States, if a German victory would not be a deadly menace
                        to its own independence and free institutions and to those of other
                        democratic nations, could have remained neutral in the war and through
                        commerce and industry accumulated vast wealth and become the great financial
                        power in the world.</p>
                    <p>IV. That the capitalists of the United States would have acted without reason
                        and contrary to their interests to have favored a war for the sake of
                        insuring a few hundred millions of debts due them by the Entente Governments
                        when the war would impose billions upon the United States, which would have
                        to be paid by taxes of which the great bulk would be collected from these
                        same capitalists, whose business enterprises would be disorganized and
                        jeopardized by war.</p>
                    <p>V. That the entry of the United States into the war against its financial and
                        industrial interests is certain evidence that it considered its own and the
                        world’s democracy in grave peril from Prussian aggression, particularly the
                        newly arisen democracy of Russia.</p>
                    <p>VI. That every class of the population in the United States and every
                        political party are solidly behind the Government in pressing the war
                        through to a victorious conclusion regardless of cost in life or treasure.

                    <p rend="center">Memorandum for an American Bureau of Public Information in
                        Europe</p>
                    <p>Pressure from various quarters has been brought to bear on the Army
                        Authorities to undertake Propaganda along the lines of the different
                        European organizations. Both the British and French maintain bureaus in the
                        allied and neutral countries each one considering its own national interest
                        as well as that of the allied cause.</p>
                    <p>Thus far, our only “Propaganda” has been through the Press Division of the
                        Intelligence Section of the American Expeditionary Forces which has charge
                        of public relations and of censorship. It has supplied information freely to
                        all who wished it, distributed photographs in allied countries and extended
                        unusual facilities to influential civilians and writers and correspondents
                        for seeing our Army.</p>
                    <p>Any organization that we may develop in the future should be under Government
                        direction. Volunteer organizations will not only overlap but will assume a
                        semi-official capacity if they receive official assistance necessary for
                        efficiency, and, unless they carry out the spirit of Government’s
                        intentions, may produce mischievous results in a work which requires the
                        most delicate possible handling. Dismissing the Volunteer System as
                        impracticable, we may follow one of two courses.</p>
                    <p>I. The Press Division may extend its work along present lines by an increase
                        of personnel and a small appropriation which might come from the War
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>II. We might establish a central bureau in Paris where the Press Division
                        already has an office and branch bureaus in London, Rome and Madrid, the
                        Central Bureau being in liaison with the Committee of Public Information in
                        Washington and the Intelligence Section of the Army. Our policy should be to
                        stiffen the moral[e] and determination of the allied countries by the
                        presentation of the immense power which America could exert against the
                        Germans when our preparations are complete. It would counteract German
                        propaganda and other propaganda which has had such serious results in Italy
                        for example, and by<pb n="22" facs="0042" xml:id="pg_22"/> the exposition of
                        American thoughts and ideals, remedy the too common scepticism of our
                        motives among the masses in the allied countries who can not conceive that
                        we are not in the war for territorial or commercial gains. After peace
                        negotiations had begun, the organization would still be serviceable in its
                        influence as a means of reflecting our national aims.</p>
                    <p>The chairman of the central bureau in Paris should be a man of broad European
                        experience, and the branch bureaus in London, Madrid and Rome and the
                        Scandinavian countries should be directed by men who knew the country to
                        which they were assigned sympathetically and spoke the language fluently,
                        including an eminent scholar, a practical man of affairs, an economist, a
                        journalist and others who would reach different institutions and classes of
                        Society. Upon the choice of these men and the character of the chairman
                        would depend the results of the work which would be carried on in a
                        dignified, modest and thorough manner in keeping with the character of the
                        New America as opposed to the America with which Europeans associate
                        boasting, flamboyancy and commercialism.</p>

                    <p>The principal assistants would be expected, as a matter of patriotiam [<hi
                            rend="italic">patriotism</hi>] as well as of wisdom in the policy of
                        such work, to give their services for small remuneration. Out of an
                        appropriation of $500,000. say $176,000 would be left for printing, travel
                        and emergencies of the organization. One assistant at the Central Bureau
                        should be am [<hi rend="italic">an</hi>] accountant who would act as
                        auditor. All employees would be subject to a month’s notice. No moneys
                        should be spent in such a manner that the record of the expenditure would
                        not bear public investigation.</p>
                    <p>1. Sound ethics as well as sound policy apparently require that our people
                        should be told the truth in some detail of the present situation of the
                        Allies. The facts had better come from the government now than later from
                        other sources which may play into the hands of critics.</p>
                    <pb n="23" facs="0043" xml:id="pg_23"/>
                    <p>2. Allied representations of the danger of the Germans winning a military
                        decision on the Western Front should be considered in relation to the
                        Allies’ desire to have us committed to the war with our last drop of blood
                        and last dollar to gain ends, which, in some instances, are not in keeping
                        with our declared purpose in the war.</p>
                    <p>3. In any event a campaign of education as to the actualities of the present
                        situation should be inaugurated at home. The only force which will be
                        convincing to the German General Staff in its survey of the situation is
                        military force and the building of the bridge across the Atlantic which will
                        bring military force to bear upon the German Army. Any preparations, even
                        any public emotion, which is a diversion from this purpose will only play
                        into the hands of the German military party which judges our effectiveness
                        only by its measure of the power of our blows and our potential blows. The
                        response of our people to the truth should be so determined and concrete in
                        its warlike intensity that the German Staff will not mistake our meaning;
                        for this is the best weapon to place in the President’s hands for the
                        earliest possible ending of the war.</p>
                    <p>4. The French government should be informed of our purpose in telling our
                        people the facts in order that the French government may, if it chooses, use
                        its censorship in suppressing what may be harmful to French morale while
                        strengthening to our own.</p>
                    <p>5. It is common talk among the French, and in a lesser degree among the
                        English, masses that we are willing to loan the Allies money[<hi
                            rend="italic">,</hi>] to subscribe to Red Cross funds and provide
                        ambulanciers but we are not willing to shed our blood. As the most
                        convincing proof of our determination our trained troops, no matter how
                        small their numbers, should, even at the expense of heavy casulaties [<hi
                            rend="italic">casualties</hi>], play a part against any great German
                        offensive on the Western Front which will be well heralded in Europe.</p>
                    <p>6. In the event of a disaster to the French Army prevision requires that we
                        safeguard our army, and, in the extreme event, join the British Army using
                        British bases for future operations.</p>
                    <p>7. Such is the character of the French people and such the effect of the
                        strain that they have borne for more than three years that every possible
                        infleunce [<hi rend="italic">influence</hi>] should be exerted to stiffen
                        their morale with convicition [<hi rend="italic">conviction</hi>] of our
                        strength in order that they may withstand the shock of another great
                        offensive which will undoubtedly be directed against their sector if the
                            German[<hi rend="italic">s</hi>] decide to make a supreme effort for a
                        decision on the Western Front.</p>

                        1, 1918</p>
                    <p>The underlying purpose of this Division is to help in the dissemination of
                        news regarding America with special reference to making clear the reasons
                        why this country entered the war, its purposes, military preparations and
                        efforts. America is appealing to the good sense and democratic instincts of
                        the world. Such an appeal lacks reality unless it reaches the newspaper
                        readers of the world. This particular Division deals with “spot” news i.e.,
                        material requiring dissemination by telegram, cable or radio.</p>
                    <p>Speaking generally, it is fair to say that America has largely been
                        misunderstood throughout the world and developments in this country have
                        been badly or inadequately presented in the foreign press. This is no new
                        condition. America for years has been unfortunately advertised. With some
                        notable exceptions, it can be stated that brief items, often sensational in
                        character and never with background or proportion, have constituted the news
                        sent from this country. Many important news distributing centers have
                        received no direct news from here.</p>

                            channels throughout the world and particularly with the channels through

                            terminated after having been tried for a few weeks and later the present
                            service was instituted. The service usually consists of several short
                            items, which over a period of time, are intended to give a picture of
                            developments in America. It is the only direct news service from this

                            Radio and intercepted by a French radio station. The original intention
                            was that this service should go into Russia and arrangements were made
                            to have the messages retransmitted and intercepted by the Russian
                            station at Moscow but owing to the chaotic situation in Russia the
                            messages for some time have not been received in that country. The
                            service to France goes to the Maison de la Presse for distribution in
                            France, and is telegraphed to the American Legation at Berne where it is
                            also given out for publication. Recently the service has been sent from

                    <p>The presidential messages were quite generally printed in full in the leading
                        newspapers of the world. Such publication has gone a long way towards making
                        clear to the world the American attitude and purposes.</p>
                    <p>As illustrative of the way in which presidential addresses are handled by the
                        press associations, the following statement by the Kokusai Agency of Japan
                        is interesting. After describing how the message was handled in the United
                        States to San Francisco the statement goes on to say:—</p>
                    <quote>
                        <p>“It had traveled overland for nearly four thousand miles and then
                            commenced its long under the sea trip from San Francisco to the Island
                            of Guam. Here again the long message was taken down and ‘relayed’ once
                            more for China and Japan where the Reuter agent in Shanghai and the
                            general manager of Kokusai had been notified to accept it. This
                            notification was received late on Tuesday night the 4th, and again on
                            Wednesday the 5th.<note n="5" xml:id="d12fn5">December 4 and 5,
                                1917.</note> During the afternoon of the fifth the first section of
                            about one hundred words came in on the wire to the headquarters of the
                            Kokusai Agency at Sojuro-cho. Here all preparation had been made to give
                            this great message a fitting reception and treatment; the editors,
                            translators, manifolders and messengers had all been organized for the
                            work. Experienced editors taking turns, received the telegrams as they
                            came. These were immediately rewritten on the typewriter to dictation of
                            the editor. Short “takes” were passed to translators and then to the
                            chief translator in Japanese and English for reediting. The retouched
                            and compared sheets were then rewritten and passed to the manifolder for
                            the machine work of the reproduction of the copies necessary.</p>
                        <p>“It was a busy and interesting night for, owing to the extreme pressure
                            on the local wires the matter came slowly. Fifty-two messages of between
                            seventy and one hundred words were received and each one passed through
                            the same machine.</p>
                        <p>“The utmost care was taken to prevent premature publication of any part
                            of the message before the whole was ready for simultaneous
                            distribution.</p>
                        <p>“The first completed copies were put upon the outgoing trains for the far
                            out-of-town newspapers. The first of the copies of the message in full
                            English and translation was delivered at the general manager’s office
                            early in the morning—and immediately this was approved, a full copy was
                            sent to the American Ambassador. After the copy was <pb n="27"
                                facs="0047" xml:id="pg_27"/>delivered the ‘release’ was given and
                            the bicycle messengers rushed out so that every newspaper would receive
                            it promptly and without discrimination.</p>
                        <p>“The news agencies which, cooperating with the Kokusai, distribute the
                            Kokusai News Agency service to the provincial newspapers were supplied
                            at the same moment and then came the wider and wilder scenes in the
                            offices of the news agencies and newspapers in Tokyo, Osaka and Yokohoma
                            and Kobe and throughout the provinces. Literally hundreds of telephones
                            were commandeered and from one end of Japan to the other the contents of
                            the message were distributed and made ready for publication. The scope
                            of the distribution of the Kokusai news agency matter was never before,
                            perhaps, more thoroughly marked and, indeed, as the accompanying
                            tributes and acknowledgements will show, never so much appreciated or
                            more thoroughly recognized.</p>
                        <p>“One of the remarkable evidences of the newspaper enterprise in Japan was
                            shown by the great Osaka afternoon newspapers, which, a few hours after
                            the message was delivered at the offices, had the message printed on
                            their afternoon Osaka editions three hundred miles away.”</p>

                    <p>The Division limits itself to sending out news of events here, believing
                        that, in the long run, the best propaganda is merely to let American events
                        tell their own story. The editor abroad is given items that he can
                        reasonably be expected to print. The items are varied in appeal and always
                        have a current interest. No “cooked-up” propaganda is distributed.</p>
                    <p>This Division offices in connection with the Naval Press Censor. The Press
                        Censor, of course, sees that no military information or malicious statements
                        are cabled out of the country. The censorship is preventative; this Division
                        has the constructive problem of seeing that the American story is adequately
                        told.</p>
                    <p>Indicative of the willingness of the great press agencies to cooperate, the
                        following quotation from a letter written by the Managing Director of

                        interesting:—</p>
                    <quote>“We carry out joyfully the instructions conveyed to us for the handling
                        of these telegrams. The amount of work entailed in the telegraphing all over
                        the world and in the translating most accurately into French of the despatch
                        of three thousand words is literally gigantic. That we undertake it gladly
                        we have already said, for we know that we are rendering good and true aid to

                    </list>
                    <p>A campaign of foreign education (or <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        propaganda) in order to be intelligently prosecuted relies, of course, on
                        accurate information. The following is an outline of the kinds of
                        information which will be needed, together with an indication of what can be
                        supplied by the Army Intelligence Section.</p>
                    <p>1. (a) The Propaganda Section will want to keep up with the latest changes of
                        popular feeling within Germany as regards the United States. It will want to
                        know any notable failures to inform, such as the mutilated publication of
                        President <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName>’s messages or the
                        garbled accounts of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1"
                        >Baker</persName>’s statements on our armed forces. It will want to know of
                        any marked misconception Germans have in regard to our war aims, etc.</p>
                    <p>(b) The Army Intelligence Section with General <persName corresp="#p_PJJ_1"
                            >Pershing</persName> now gets the latest German newspapers, translates
                        and estimates them, as well as the latest Swiss and Scandinavian and Dutch
                        papers.</p>
                    <pb n="29" facs="0049" xml:id="pg_29"/>
                    <p>2. (a) The Propaganda Section will want to keep in touch with popular feeling
                        in Germany as hidden behind what the newspapers give.</p>
                    <p>(b) The Army Intelligence Section collates reports of agents within Germany,
                        of travelers from Germany, and of mail censors’ findings, as supplied by the
                        Allies, and by our own State, War, Navy and Justice Departments. These
                        reports generally tell a very different story from that in the German
                        newspapers.</p>
                    <p>3. (a) Propaganda will want to know the run of feeling among soldiers in the
                        enemy trenches.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence collects information from prisoners and deserters,
                        overhears talk in enemy trenches, and often, through patrols and raids, gets
                        enemy letters and documents.</p>
                    <p>4. (a) Propaganda will want to know actual conditions in the enemy trenches,
                        which affect morale, such as amount of food, conditions of living, friction
                        between infantry and artillery, jealousies between Prussians and Bavarians,
                        what the soldiers read, how often they get relief, etc.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence,—through patrols and raids, as well as by aerial
                        observation, and from prisoners and deserters,—has the answer to the above
                        question.</p>
                    <p>5. (a) Propaganda will want to know the exact character of certain divisions
                        in certain sectors, e.g., the location of divisions just transferred from
                        the East Front and probably undermined with Bolsheviki, the location of
                        Saxon regiments, probably with a big percentage of socialists, location of
                        Bavarians, jealous of Prussians, or of Czecho–Slovaks likely to desert.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence aims to locate every division in the German Army.</p>
                    <p>6. (a) Propaganda will want to know of any German army orders affecting its
                        work. For example, the reported General Army Order to shoot any soldier
                        caught reading propaganda dropped from the air might make it advisable to
                        restrict <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> propaganda to small printed
                        paper slips, which a soldier could conceal.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence aims to supply such information.</p>
                    <p>7. (a) Propaganda will most of all want to know <hi rend="italic">what
                            treatment is meted out to its papers in the German trenches.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence can get some of this information from prisoners, from
                        aerial observation and from patrols and raids. It can attempt to get it from
                        agents in Germany, can have them instructed to look out for such
                            information.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">An unknown hand wrote the
                            following addition to this sentence: “+ can put them in Germany for the
                            purpose of finding out.”</note>

                    <p>8. (a) Propaganda will want to know what methods of distribution work best,
                        aeroplane, trench mortar or patrol, and what new methods are possible, such
                        as balloons or kites.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence can make observations and studies of these
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>9. (a) Propaganda will want to know other possibilities of extending
                        distribution, such as loading printed matter into machines of our Allies
                        engaged in reconnaissance, fighting or bombing, or such as distribution by
                        Allied patrols.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence can get information on this.</p>
                    <p>10. (a) Propaganda will want to know what methods have been tried and
                        discarded; also the principal Teuton tricks, so as to avoid them.</p>
                    <p>(b) Army Intelligence is now making a study of what the Allies have done in
                        aeroplane propaganda; what methods they still follow, and what won’t work;
                        also what the Russians are now doing on the East Front; also what the
                        Teutons have done, especially their successes, such as the misleading of the
                        Italian Second Army last October.<note n="3" xml:id="d13fn3">Reference is
                            presumably to the Battle of Caporetto, which began on October 24, 1917,
                            and in which the German army advanced rapidly against Italian
                            troops.</note>

                        to indorse ten thousand monthly or any cumbersome local committee plan. Let
                        us go slowly until we get our bearings. Emphatically certain that it would
                        be distinctly injudicious to involve Embassy or Consulate directly or
                        overtly. Nothing to be gained and disadvantage obvious. Committee’s branch
                        here should function on its own responsibility, working independently with
                        close relations with Embassy understood and in coordination with other
                        friendly bodies to obviate duplication and overlapping, but always
                        maintaining its supremacy in influence and control. Our work must be done
                        aggressively, openly, and cleanly with due regard for dignity and
                        conservatism and a complete avoidance of methods which would place us on
                        level with German propagandists. I shall investigate with a view to possible
                        action later expediency of encouraging friendly newspaper by openly
                        purchasing and using space at regular advertising rates or otherwise

                            points: “each part of the final settlement must be based upon the

                            are most likely to bring a peace that will be permanent”; “peoples and
                            provinces are not to be bartered about from sovereignty to sovereignty
                            as if they were mere chattels and pawns in a game”; “every territorial
                            settlement involved in this war must be made in the interest and for the
                            benefit of the populations concerned”; and “all well defined national

                    <p>General outlook therefore attractive until you put it to the test of
                        immediate war utility in a country distracted by civil war and warred upon
                        from without by a country which it may fight defensively, but not with any
                        intention of helping the Allies. They are wild internationalists who not
                        only in the beginning, but until lately, were willing to have German support
                        for their own ends of revolution. Germany thought she could direct the
                        storm, but the storm had <hi rend="italic">such</hi> intention. No other
                        country who gives either aid or kindness will fare better. Anything offered
                        short of military aid will be accepted, and will not count in the balance
                        against the intended program of agitation in the United States and among
                        Entente nations. So on strict basis war, utility is lacking for what the
                        Bolsheviks will do they will do anyhow; but indirectly America gains by
                        having America all the time presented, and the President’s influence in the
                        crucial time of future general peace-making grows largely through a
                        continued Russian drive. I recommend that the whole news and circulation
                        plan go ahead to the end of the war or until Russia is at actual peace.</p>
                    <p>On meetings and oratory I have probably disappointed you. How useless they
                        would have been you can not appreciate until I tell you face to face. Would
                        have liked to have started outspoken Government owned news paper, but man
                        and mechanical power were both lacking. Has taken a week, for instance, to

                        takes me three days to get cash money from bank. In such sheer unexampled
                        disorganization of business life it was sounder to let newspapers themselves
                        be disseminators. <persName corresp="#p_BA_1">Bullard</persName> will try

                        worse and faster peace makers coming in. Finally, we will keep going as if

                        approaching editors of both classes of papers in Switzerland that such
                        information as your Department furnishes, developed in the way I have
                        already proposed to you, meets a warm welcome, especially when connected

                            >Whitehouse</persName> noted, not all Embassy officials were in accord
                        with this approach. Specifically citing Secretary of the Embassy in Bern

                        wrote: “Our main difference of opinion is that he fears a frank news policy

                        has been strengthened by the conversations I have had already with editors

                        acknowledged Governmental activities in propaganda are highly inadvisable.
                        Since the beginning of the war German propaganda has flooded Switzerland to
                        such an extent that public opinion in this country turns away in a natural
                        reaction from any thing that tends to that direction.” He continued:
                        “Furthermore I am convinced that one article written by an editor from
                        conviction of his heart is of more value than tons of literature and that
                        personal and unofficial relations with editors to explain America’s views is
                        the best type of propaganda.” He concluded: “I feel that if she were a

                        both departments at home. It was that I was to represent myself as the agent
                        of the Associated Press, who was here not to give news but to send news back

                        ago two envelopes of feature stuff came for me in the pouch, yesterday he
                        told me they were there and I could have them if I came for them. He said if
                        the Legation sent them to me and the hotel people (the porters!) noticed it,
                        they might take it as a recognition of my official position. Please laugh!
                        That’s why I am telling you all this silly stuff. I should like to be
                        Secretary of State for a few months and reorganize the department—let in
                        some modern daylight.</p>
                    <p>These two young men, for instance, are steeped in old traditions of intrigue
                        and double dealing. The system of our diplomatic service developes from
                        young men of independent incomes, a class who did very well doubtless at
                        courts, such as the Russian autocracy and the Germans used to have, but they
                        do not represent our own democracy.—One thing about our system which I
                        approve entirely is the appointing of ministers and of ambassadors from
                        outside the service. Of course the little secretaries hate it and say it
                        threatens destruction to everything because the ministers and ambassadors
                        come and ignore a great deal of the traditional cobwebby musty effects,
                        which seem all important to the trained diplomat. These diplomats are not
                        American, they are not democratic, they are not representative, they and
                        their wives often even make fun of their own country and country people. I

                        again what you told me not to, I am behaving like a statesman and not like a
                        press representative. When you are President, please make me Secretary of
                        State; I KNOW I could do it.</p>
                    <p>To get back to business:</p>
                    <p>FREIE ZEITUNG. The Legation is all excited over the attacks by the
                        Germanaphile Swiss press on the Freie Zeitung because of the statement
                        contained in literature dropped by aeroplanes in Germany that “we” are
                        supporting and aiding the German liberals in Switzerland. If the members of
                        the Legation had ever been in a political campaign they would not lose their
                        poise so completely over every attack of the enemy—Dr. Schlieken takes it
                        very calmly—just as I used to take MRS LANSING’S<note n="10"
                            xml:id="d17fn10">Eleanor Foster Lansing, wife of Secretary of State

                        a pacifist! because I worked for suffrage in war times.</p>
                    <p>The point of the difficulty is this: That the Swiss have already tried once
                        to suppress the Freie Zeitung on the ground that its opposition to the
                        German government was against their neutrality laws—At that time a newspaper
                        protest came from America against a democracy like Switzerland suppressing a
                        paper simply because it urged democracy in Germany. It is feared that if
                        these assertions (about our support) are continued, a new attack might be
                        made against the Freie Zeitung on the ground that it is not a sincere
                        expression of German Democracy, but a subsidized attempt at propaganda on
                        our part. Dr. Schlieken thought it would be just as well if these assertions
                        were not repeated, hence I mentioned it in my cable of February 22nd. I said
                        in the cable Feb 19th that I would assume the responsibility of taking an
                            office.<note n="12" xml:id="d17fn12">Neither the February 22 nor the
                            February 19 cable was found.</note> The condition here about rooms and
                        offices is worse here than in Washington, because there at least you can
                        bribe people to rent their houses and offices. Here the Swiss who have lived
                        through generations in the same rooms won’t even be bribed. Ever since I
                        have been here I have been agitating and advertising for an office—at last I
                        found a dark little hole of four rooms I could have beginning May 1st, but
                        one of the rooms I could have at once. Then <persName corresp="#p_WW_1"
                            >Wilson</persName> and I sent our telegram, and I waited until your
                        answer came. I assumed the responsibility of taking the office—I went to get
                        the one room—but in the meantime, it had been taken, and as yet I have found
                        nothing.</p>
                    <pb n="39" facs="0059" xml:id="pg_39"/>
                    <p>It will take, of course, an endless time to have a telephone put in, and I am
                        keen to be all ready to start work when the “clear cut” decision comes. If
                        it is against us, doubtless I can get rid of the office.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, the films and your operator will arrive and we will have
                        NOWHERE to show the films—no use to make of them because you have never
                        answered my cables about the Cinema Co—and the necessary capital. And every
                        day the Germans are buying up more and more of the businesses. Do you
                        understand that when I say “BUY” I do not mean buy the buildings but the
                        business, good-will, fixtures, and LICENSES, which is important because the
                        government will not issue more licenses and I am prevented of course from
                        even approaching them on the subject.</p>
                    <p>I feel confident of being able to do this work better than any one here. I am
                        sure I am of a higher order of intelligence and my experience is so much
                        wider than theirs—and that’s not saying very much. You remember when I left
                        I was full of distrust of my own ability. If the decision is in our favor
                        and it is possible for me to undertake the work at all, I should like to get
                        the work started and well organized—because I see HOW to do it—and then I
                        want you to find someone to take my place if the war continues. I say that
                        because I think there is a limit to what can be accomplished in a little
                        spot like this and I want to do more fundamental work! I would feel I was
                        helping more at home agitating against some of the things that will be
                        happening in our own city.</p>
                    <p>Has Mr. Aubert spoken to you of a Monsieur Godard? He is the man who has
                        charge of communicating with the French Commission in Washington. He has
                        been here only a little longer than I. I asked him what struck him most in
                        the situation and he said it was the smallness of the group here whose
                        opinions count. He put it at 200 men, for the whole of Switzerland including
                        both factions, pro-ally and pro-German, also foreigners, as well as Swiss—I
                        was struck by the same thing and have already written to you about it—and
                        the way these men gossip! Rappard is the gossipiest of them all—</p>
                    <p>The French Bureau de la Presse have at last taken me into their very
                        center—Haguenin has discovered that I can be helpful—I can gain for him and
                        myself an entree into any group through the women because they all know who
                        I am and are eager to see me and meet me! Haguenin has been here for two
                        years and at least has information of great value.</p>
                    <p>I spoke to Dr. Schlieben who has become a close friend of mine about Mr.
                        Waltiers (English agent) view of the French Maison de la Presse as a huge
                        fraud. Dr. Schlieben thinks that the Paris division is no good—and the Swiss
                        Division good only for its translations and<pb n="40" facs="0060"
                            xml:id="pg_40"/> analysis of the German press. I am sending you a copy
                        of his report. If I have an office here later would you like me to have this
                        report of theirs translated into English and abbreviated for your
                        information? Please answer this question. I can do it easily—if we

                        me know. He has never done so. There is certainly no sign of it in any of
                        the papers. These papers reprint American news from London and Paris papers
                        showing how keen they are for it.</p>
                    <p>This morning I very subtly (!) asked Mr. Dulles about the Cable News and he

                        round-faced boy here—a kind of attache called *Day, who I think is supposed
                        to do the translating. Perhaps he tries his hand at the news when he has
                        nothing else to do. He is only about 20 or 21, and I am confident has no
                        sense of news values. The whole legation is <hi rend="italic">poisoned</hi>
                        by antagonism to your department—Do you know that? It seems that it must
                        come from instructions or lack of instructions from Washington.</p>

                        work, and I shall very shortly be sending you assistance. In the meantime, a
                        great deal of assistance can probably be picked up in Paris. I know the
                        French better<pb n="42" facs="0062" xml:id="pg_42"/> than any other European
                        people in this war, and so can perhaps do a little judging on the situation,
                        myself.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, I am of the opinion that printed propaganda has worn
                        itself out a little in all countries, and that word of mouth stuff is
                        infinitely more valuable. I also know that the French are great on
                        conferences, and that public lecturers are excellent propagandists. Much was
                        done in an organized way last winter by such speakers as Herbert Adams
                            Gibbons.<note n="3" xml:id="d18fn3">
                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> journalist.</note> I think you
                        should do all you can to organize the Americans capable of making an
                        acceptable speech in French language, and sending them forth with the
                        general ideas which we wish to implant. This work is much better done by
                        perhaps Americans than by Frenchmen, provided the Americans can speak the
                        language acceptably. If you are going heavily into that department please
                        let me know, because I think I can send you a few people from here.</p>
                    <p>If I were you, I should avoid the mistake of allowing myself to be closely
                        connected with what we call “the ex-patriot bunch” in Paris. These people
                        look to Paris society and the French Official class for their social
                        sanctions, and are no more in touch with the real people of France than a
                        foreigner who had invaded New York society would be in touch with the real
                        people of America. Too much has been done perhaps with the upper classes of
                        the French and not nearly enough with the people in general. Just before I
                        left France in February, I took a trip through the South in order to find
                        what the people were thinking and talking about, as regards America. I found
                        that the German whispering propaganda has been busy down there, and that
                        nothing had been done among them to controvert the idea that we are money
                        grabbing people who entered the war to prevent financial panic, who are
                        loaning funds to Europe at luxurious interest, and who, when the allied
                        nations are exhausted, will come over and collect on the mortgage with fresh
                        armies. As you have probably perceived by now, Europe is getting very
                        radical, and what is whispered among the submerged classes today may be the
                        dominant thought of the governing classes tomorrow, so even in friendly
                        France we cannot overlook the working and peasant classes.</p>
                    <p>Here is the thing upon which I suggest immediate action: In thinking over
                        this matter of propaganda. I realize that the most effective propaganda done
                        in America during the period of our neutrality, was done by prominent
                        newspaper and magazine writers for our American publications, who went to
                        Europe, took one side or the other, came back and wrote about it. A

                            <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> journalist.</note> These Americans
                        had their own following among our magazine or newspaper readers and talked
                        our own intellectual language as the Europeans did not. Now, I want to
                        encourage star French journalists and literary men to come to America and
                        write us up. One problem confronts us there. The European publications are
                        run on a very much more narrow margin of expenses than the American and
                        cannot afford to pay huge expense accounts as ours can. It may be necessary
                        for us to offer to pay their expenses. I dislike to do this for two
                        reasons—first our money is somewhat limited in proportion to the job we have
                        to do, and second this method might be criticised. But, after all it is not
                        really illegitimate, and the main thing is to get the men here. If you can
                        arrange for such men, the more eminent the better, to visit America, we will
                        arrange at this end to have them taken in hand, given a good time and shown
                        everything.</p>
                    <p>This is about the organization that I have suggested for most of the European
                        nations. We will have to modify it sometimes to suit individual
                        circumstances. First, the Director, second one or two expert newspaper men
                        or professional publicity agents; third, a bureau of speakers in which
                        should be included someone to take charge of distribution and use of moving
                        picture films; fourth, one or two first rate American advertising men; at
                        least one person whose job it is to travel through the country and gather
                        information for our use; about what the people are saying about us with a
                        view to ascertaining what our needs are in the way of propaganda.</p>
                    <p>Item four may strike you as curious. It is, in fact, one of my hobbies. I
                        have been watching both British and French propaganda. They are both rather
                        inept because these people are a generation behind us in the advertising
                        game. We invented and developed it, and we are the only people, except the
                        Germans, who have been trained to be experts on psychology. I want to send
                        over to Europe and use there, the kind of American advertising man who has
                        the priceless jewel of originality in him—who will think of the thing that
                        no one else will think of. Of course, I should want his work gone over and
                        experted by those who better understand the people, in order to prevent his
                        making a mistake. Please do not understand this idea in its narrow sense. I
                        do not want a man to write American advertising. I want one to think of the
                        thing that no one else thought of before in the way of influencing
                        people.</p>

                    <p>Since you are new to France and do not, I understand, speak the French
                        language, I should suggest that you make connections with someone who really
                        understands the people and that you talk most of your plans over with him
                        and be guided by his advice. The French are a people of great intelligence,
                        as you know, but of various mental peculiarities; methods that go great with
                        us, frequently fall down absolutely with them and vice versa. Moreover, in
                        no other country of Europe except Spain, is it so easy for the well
                        intentioned outsider to give offense to his public.</p>

                        formerly devised for getting literature to civilian population of Germany.
                        Consists of balloon about nine feet in diameter carrying apparatus which
                        will hold ten thousand quarter size leaflets and feed them separately on
                        principle of automatic feed of printing press at rate of 12 or 24 per
                        minute. Has bomb attachment which will destroy apparatus when last leaflet
                        is fed. Such a balloon with average wind currents would have touring range
                        of between five and seven hundred miles and could therefore easily reach
                        Prussia. Rises to about two and one half miles and could therefore take
                        advantage of the stable upper air currents. Clock arrangement enables
                        starter to make it begin feeding at any time he desires after rising. Works

                            corresp="#p_GH_1">Gibson</persName>. Following plan of activities in
                        Italy submitted for your consideration. Our purpose should be to:—</p>
                    <p>One: Improve morale of Italian people of all classes.</p>
                    <p>Two: Counteract effects of German propaganda which is being done effectively
                        through various channels.</p>
                    <p>Three: Counter attacks on German campaign of misrepresentation concerning the
                        United States its aims and preparations.</p>
                    <p>Four: Keep the Italian people impressed with our great and rapidly increasing
                        resources and our determination to aid Italy in every possible way.</p>
                    <pb n="48" facs="0068" xml:id="pg_48"/>
                    <p>Five: Spread understanding of the liberal ideas for which we are fighting
                        with a view, not only to maintaining public opinion enthusiasm but also to
                        strengthen intelligent public opinion so that it will resist reactionary
                        tendencies.</p>
                    <p>The means we have at our disposal to accomplish these ends are:</p>
                    <p>One: There should be made accessible to all the people good translations of
                        the President’s utterances bearing on the war. These should be put out so
                        far as possible under the names of Italians prominent in different ways with
                        varying comment for the enlightenment of different classes. The people hold
                        the President in deep reverence and a comprehensive campaign for the spread
                        of his ideals and purposes would be effective and of inconsiderable cost.
                        Material should be furnished to writers and speakers on American war aims as
                        set forth in the President’s speeches. One of the reasons for lack of
                        popular enthusiasm seems to be that there has not been enough appeal to
                        democratic ideals.</p>
                    <p>Two: Moving picture campaign which should be undertaken at once and on large
                        scale. Poorer and more ignorant classes who are most dangerously infected
                        with anti-war spirit are not always to be reached through press or pamphlets
                        campaigns but show deep (#)<note n="2" xml:id="d22fn2">As in the original.

                        more results here than in France and that effort should be concentrated
                        here. In a small way good effects have been secured from small supply of
                        films already furnished.</p>
                    <p>Three: The Press campaign is relatively simple here and can be handled on
                        established lines. Italian papers show more interest in American news and
                        articles than either French or Swiss papers and committee has secured
                        gratifying amount of space. There should be organized in the United States a
                        campaign of letters written by Italians to their friends and families in
                        this country telling of the war spirit of America, the feeling for Italy,
                        the privations in food and other necessities that Americans are willingly
                        accepting so that the Allies can be supplied. The more ignorant classes will
                        place more credence in such letters than in printed information.</p>

                        there should be a number of other Italian speaking Americans traveling
                        constantly about the country talking about America and its aims. Good
                        Italian speaking manager for the Bureau should be sent at once.</p>

                    <p>Six: Commercial propaganda, Red Cross activities, visits of Italian
                        correspondents, and public men to our bases and front in France, still
                        pictures and such other that as may suggest themselves from time to
                        time.</p>
                    <p>The organization at Rome alone will not be able to handle the situation
                        properly. There should be active sub centers at Milan, Turin, Florence,
                        Genoa and Naples, some of them under direction of our Consular officers and
                        some under especially assigned men; also representatives at Padua for
                        propaganda in enemy countries. The problems presented at these different
                        places are quite varied and need close and constant supervision. Consul at
                        Milan has done good work mostly at his own expense. Other districts
                        neglected except as their needs could be understood and attended to from
                        Rome.</p>
                    <p>Situation here is undoubtedly fraught with grave danger which may readily
                        lead to another disaster. This situation demands an immediate and energetic
                        campaign of education. We are in a particularly advantageous position to
                        undertake it as there seems to be more confidence here in the power and
                        honesty of the President than in any of the Allies. Ten thousand dollars a
                        month should be considered a minimum for effective work in Italy and it
                        should be made available at once so that our people can go to work and get
                        results. Time is the vital element and a decision one way or the other
                        should be taken at once; a month from now it may be too late. We must be
                        prepared to spend money as the situation requires in such a critical
                        situation, inadequate resources are hardly worth applying.</p>
                    <p>We have an earnest and competent crowd here and they should be given full
                        support if we are to do anything worth while. Foregoing is substance of plan
                        agreed upon in full conference with them.</p>

                        America would divert slightly our military resources but might seriously
                        cloud the political horizon. America’s political offensive against Germany
                        would suffer if forced intervention in Central America made the whole Latin
                        American continent fearful of the United States and gave Germany the chance
                        to raise a cry of “Yankee imperialism.”</p>

                        divert United States energies. In this case they work for the definite end
                        of forcing the kind of United States intervention which would invite the cry
                        of “Yankee Imperialism” and give Berlin a talking point against the American

                    <p>There are indications that German wireless stations are concealed in Costa

                        positions has been picked up in Costa Rica in more than one place. A

                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">In general</hi> Guatemala is the most pro-American state
                        in Central America. Costa Rica is next. Nicaragua is the most
                            anti-American,<pb n="54" facs="0074" xml:id="pg_54"/> therefore
                        pro-German. Salvador is pro-German because of German capital. Honduras is
                        pro-Mexican.</p>
                    <p>The merchant class is the chief power in Costa Rica. There are no big
                        commercial houses representing the United States. The United Fruit Company,
                        far and away the most powerful concern in Costa Rica, owning more land than
                        any one except the government, is British in the eyes of the people, since
                        its ships sail under the British flag though its capital is American. The
                        British embargo on coffee, Costa Rica’s chief export, has caused some
                        feeling against Britain.</p>
                    <p>Germany has the Hamburg-American Line offices, owns most of the coffee
                        plantations and has fifteen large wholesale houses in San Jose. Consequently
                        there is a strong pro-German colony, many of whose members are married to
                        Costa Ricans.</p>
                    <p>The only real enthusiasms felt for any foreign country are for France. Costa
                        Rican higher education is mostly in Paris.</p>
                    <p>One other economic fact should be kept in mind by American psychologists.
                        Inasmuch as the middle class is poor and as there is absolutely no work for
                        girls in Costa Rica prostitution is very widespread. There are not more than
                        forty girls holding jobs in San Jose and women look upon these as degraded
                        in comparison with the prostitutes.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">ever present</hi> factor is that Costa Ricans, even
                        those most friendly to the United States, have always shown signs of fear
                        lest the United States government should have designs on the country. This
                        persistent apprehension is the underlying factor in all Latin American
                        countries and just now is being continuously harped on by pro-German
                        propagandists’ cries of “the ogre in the North” and “the vulture casting
                        longing eyes on all Latin Republics.”</p>
                    <p>As regards <hi rend="italic">publicity,</hi> billboards, pamphlets and
                        handbills are extensively used to influence public opinion. Movies are
                        popular and are a great medium of advertising. Newspapers are important,
                        uncensored and widely read. The chief papers are “El Tiempo”, Port Limon
                        (English and Spanish); “El Heraldo de Atlantico” (Spanish weekly) Port
                        Limon; “L’Informacion” (Spanish daily) reaches all classes, San Jose; “La
                        Republica” (Spanish daily) San Jose; “El Noticiero” (Spanish daily) San
                        Jose; “La Prensa Libre” (Spanish daily) San Jose.</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Dont’s</hi> for American psychologists as obtained from
                        students of Costa Rica are:</p>
                    <p>(1) Don’t brag. The Latin American is sick of hearing how <hi rend="italic"
                            >big</hi> the United States is. It is what he fears most. Let him <hi
                            rend="italic">infer</hi> how powerful the United States is, don’t rub it
                        in directly.</p>
                    <p>(2) Don’t represent the United States as perfect, or Americans as thinking
                        themselves superior to every other race. Better say that the<pb n="55"
                            facs="0075" xml:id="pg_55"/> United States has big faults but is
                        struggling ahead faster and more democratically than any other nation.</p>
                    <p>(3) Don’t threaten. The Latin American is intensely proud. Flattery appeals
                        to him, with understanding of his difficulties and eternal expression of
                        personal solicitude for him.</p>
                    <p>(4) Don’t say “Americans and America”. Say the “United States.” Latin
                        Americans resent describing the United States as the whole of America.</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Things to emphasize are:</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>(1) United States war preparations, their efficiency, thoroughness and
                        speed.</p>
                    <p>(2) United States unity and determination to win a just peace.</p>
                    <p>(3) The anti-imperialistic war aims of the United States as declared by
                        President <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName>, but guard against
                        representing <persName corresp="#p_WW_1">Wilson</persName> as a dictator,
                        ambitious to dominate the war and the world.</p>
                    <p>(4) America’s intervention makes Allied victory certain. German
                        propagandists’ great cry in Latin America is “<hi rend="italic">Alemania
                            vencera</hi>”, “Germany will win”.</p>
                    <p>(5) United States traditional friendliness for Republics. Emphasize any honor
                        shown in the United States to South American visitors, writers and
                        artists.</p>
                    <p>(6) The passing of the bumptious American globe trotter and the tricky
                        American salesman. Tell of the reform in United States ideals of business
                        and the new determination to please Latin American business men.</p>
                    <p>(7) America’s changing attitude toward labor and new curb on corporations
                        which exploited workers in the United States just as in Latin American
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Open and above-board direct education</hi>, will have its
                        hardest sledding in Latin America where indirection, flowery courtesy,
                        flattery and “palaver” are indispensable.</p>
                    <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The three general principles</hi> laid down for American
                        psychologic efforts, however, are just as valid here as any where, viz:</p>
                    <p>(1) The United States is in this war for ten years if need be.</p>
                    <p>(2) The United States will make peace any day, on democratic
                        anti-imperialistic terms.</p>
                    <p>(3) The United States is feeling the world-wide impetus toward reform, is
                        changing rapidly and is ending some of the very abuses which hit her
                        neighbors hardest.</p>
                    <p>Calm, courteous, confident reiteration of the fact that <hi rend="italic">the
                            United States can not lose the war</hi> will carry furthest and
                        deepest.</p>
                    <p>6. <hi rend="italic">What Can Be Done Now</hi>.</p>
                    <pb n="56" facs="0076" xml:id="pg_56"/>
                    <p>The steady feeding of daily news dispatches to Costa Rican papers and to
                        papers in nearby countries for reprint in Costa Rica can be extended at
                        once.</p>
                    <p>7. <hi rend="italic">What Can Be Done In The Future</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Besides daily news dispatches, special articles can be mailed as soon as
                        distributing agents are arranged for. The forwarding of American newspapers
                        and magazines in quantity to clubs and libraries is really important.</p>
                    <p>Special articles can be mailed from the Foreign Press Bureau for Costa Rican
                        papers and magazines. <hi rend="italic">Reprints</hi> of articles in United
                        States papers praising Latin America are extremely powerful.</p>
                    <p>Pamphlets, in Spanish, of United States war aims are influential. Pamphlets
                        explaining the <hi rend="italic">United States embargo</hi> are especially
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Moving pictures are popular and influential. Besides films which the United
                        States government can send, several film agencies sell to Latin America and
                        their sales to Costa Rica can be especially adapted. The subjects outlined
                        above can be filmed, together with general educational pictures of United
                        States’ scenery, industries, personalities, etc.</p>
                    <p>Americans living in Costa Rica could easily be utilized for psychologic
                        influence of the most penetrating kind by an agent sent directly to
                        them.</p>

                    <p>I suppose we all of us get credit for a lot of things that we don’t have so
                        much to do with. I know I got a great deal of glory out of “America’s Answer
                        to the Hun” that really belongs to E.B. Hatrick and C.J. Hubbell.<note n="2"

                            Online Supplement, Appendix A.5.</note> It is easily the best piece of
                        propaganda that we have had in Europe, and I am certain that you will find
                        it of untold value in America.</p>
                    <p>They have many times risked their lives, and their deeds of daring have
                        attracted the widest attention in the army. They were the first Americans to
                        get to the Chateau-Thierry front having been sent out in a General Staff
                        car, under a special order from General <persName corresp="#p_PJJ_1"
                            >Pershing</persName>. General di Robilant, Military Representative of
                        Italy at the Inter-Allied Council at Versailles, says that the view they
                        made of Chateau-Thierry, while the shelling was the fiercest, is one of the
                        best pictures, from the viewpoint of the artillery technician, that he has
                        ever seen.</p>
                    <p>From the time of their landing here they have been most energetic in their
                        efforts and their work for the Committee on Public Information has been of
                        the very highest value. Hatrick has been instrumental in reorganizing the
                        Signal Corps photographic service, and in having shipped to America all
                        original negative films. As you know, when they first came to France, the
                        Signal Corps was badly demoralized in its photographic end. The Signal Corps
                        now has seventeen operators in the field and is able to render highly
                        efficient service.<note n="3" xml:id="d25fn3">On July 31, <persName

                        by recalling the conference of June 20th.</p>
                    <p>At that conference it was agreed that in the case of propaganda into enemy
                        countries the conditions of cooperation between the Committee on Public
                        Information and the Military Intelligence Branch should be reversed: that
                        is, that the Military Intelligence Branch should have executive
                        responsibility for such propaganda while the Committee on Public Information
                        should cooperate by supplying propaganda<pb n="60" facs="0080"
                            xml:id="pg_60"/> for distribution. In allied and neutral countries the
                        Committee has executive responsibility while the Military Intelligence
                        Branch cooperates with information and criticism, as before.</p>
                    <p>In accepting executive responsibility for enemy countries the Military
                        Intelligence Branch saw the necessity for obtaining the fullest possible
                        information on all the conditions affecting such propaganda. This
                        information is only obtainable abroad. Therefore the above named officers
                        are being sent primarily to obtain the necessary information for
                        recommending a definite plan of action and secondarily for beginning the
                        organization abroad necessary to put the plan into effect.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of War, who is also a member of the Committee on Public
                        Information, has personal knowledge of our plans.</p>

                    <p>Your communication of July 10th<note n="2" xml:id="d28fn2">See <ref
                                target="#d27">Document 27</ref>.</note> states the thing perfectly
                        satisfactorily with one exception. Paragraph III, perhaps, does not quite
                        express my understanding of the agreement between the Committee on Public
                        Information and the Intelligence Department. Rather, perhaps, this paragraph
                        needs further definition to prevent any kind of misunderstanding after I
                        leave the department.</p>
                    <pb n="61" facs="0081" xml:id="pg_61"/>
                    <p>The agreement, as I interpreted it, was that the Intelligence Department
                        should have control of the distribution of propaganda into enemy countries,
                        while the Committee should furnish the material therefor. So far my idea
                        perfectly agrees with the statement in your letter; however, I wanted it to
                        be understood that the Committee should have final judgment upon the
                        character of the propaganda, and that the work should be laid out by the
                        American representative on the Inter-Allied Board for propaganda into enemy
                        countries which has its headquarters in London. I further expressed myself
                        at that meeting and now repeat in writing, that we should arrange for the
                        heartiest cooperation and exchange of ideas between the two branches—that
                        the Military Intelligence should be consulted as to its ideas on the
                        character and policy of the propaganda, while the Committee on Public
                        Information should assist in every manner in its power with the work of
                        distribution.</p>
                    <p>We have virtually appointed Dr. G.H. Edgell of Harvard University<note n="3"

                        head of our propaganda work into enemy countries through Italy. He should be
                        on his way to his post in a few days. By the next steamer we are sending
                        over Lieutenant Ferdinand Pisecky to act as writer and interpreter in the
                        Bohemian language. Lieutenant Pisecky is a native Bohemian who deserted as
                        early as possible from the Austrian army, was incorporated into a Jugo-Slav
                        division organized by the Russians and fought with them until the collapse
                        of Russia, when he was sent to the United States by the Czecho-Slovak
                        National Council to organize their work here. He has warm recommendations
                        from Captain Voska.<note n="4" xml:id="d28fn4">Captain Emanuel Voska of the

                    <p>The working arrangement between the department of Military Intelligence and
                        the Committee on Public Information on the matter of Propaganda into Enemy
                        Countries is based fundamentally upon the closest cooperation between the
                        operating forces of both organizations.</p>
                    <p>On both labor and responsibility the line division of activities is of the
                        simplest. The parallel is that of Industrial Manufacture and
                        Distribution.</p>
                    <p>The Committee on Public Information is equipped to prepare and manufacture
                        the product, utilizing both its own and Army Intelligence sources of
                        material. The mechanical responsibility for their manufacture will be upon
                        the operating forces of the Committee, in France and in Italy—that is,
                        editorial preparation, translation, printing, etc. In this work it will have
                        the advisory aid of the representatives of Military Intelligence.</p>
                    <p>The responsibility for distribution, both as to mechanical means, and choice
                        of operating field at the fronts will be upon Military Intelligence, that
                        problem being wholly military.</p>
                    <p>The Inter-Allied Enemy Propaganda editorial board, containing representatives
                        of Great Britain, the United States, France and Italy will have the
                        oversight of the editorial policies, and the American member of the board,
                            <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">James Keeley</persName>, will be the active
                        head of the Committee on Public Information’s operating forces, with
                        headquarters at Paris. Professor G.H. Edgell, who will be the head of the
                        Committee’s Italian unit on Enemy Propaganda, will be under the general
                        supervision of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1">Keeley</persName>. Both the
                        French and the Italian units will be supplied with forces of writers,
                        translators and advertising men as needed. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_KJ_1"
                            >Keeley</persName> will be in Paris in time to consult with Captain
                            <persName corresp="#p_BH_1">Blankenhorn</persName>
                        <pb n="63" facs="0083" xml:id="pg_63"/> and his superiors by the time the
                        Military Intelligence party arrives in Paris.</p>
                    <p>To summarize, the Committee on Public Information will manufacture the
                        product, utilizing to the full the advisory aid of Military Intelligence in
                        securing useful material. Military Intelligence will distribute the product.
                        The essence of the agreement is the spirit of cooperation on mutual
                        problems.</p>
                    <p>This letter is going to you in two copies. If it meets your approval will you
                        countersign one copy and return it to the Committee?</p>

                            >The pamphlet is ibid. For “The Spirit of America in the War,” see
                            Online Supplement, Appendix A.6.</note> Looking over the pamphlet I
                        found on page 11 the following note:</p>
                    <quote>“Written for the Committee on Public Information, for translation into
                        Swedish, to be circulated as American propaganda in Sweden; first published
                        in the Minneapolis Journal Sunday May 19, 1918.”</quote>
                    <p>As soon as I read this I sent you the following wire:<note n="3"

                    <p>I am extremely sorry that you should have included a reference to American
                        propaganda in Sweden in your pamphlet, which, under such circumstances, is
                        likely to prove as harmful as otherwise it might prove useful. They are
                        extremely sensitive in regard to this kind of thing in Sweden, and we have
                        been most scrupulous in respecting their feelings on this score over there.
                        I may add that the American government is strongly averse to any form of
                        work among other nations that may be described as propaganda in the sense
                        given to that word by various German activities during the present war.</p>
                    <p>While, in writing you to obtain the article in question, I mentioned that it
                        would be published in Sweden, this did not imply any carrying on of
                        propaganda on our part. The whole tone of my confidential circular, of which
                        I enclose a copy,<note n="4" xml:id="d30fn4">Confidential circular 2, April
                            29; attached but not printed. The circular states that articles “will
                            not only be published in Sweden, but they will also be syndicated for
                            simultaneous (free) use by the entire Swedish press in this
                            country.”</note> shows that we desired merely to obtain certain
                        expressions of feeling and opinion among the Swedes in this country that
                        would convince Sweden, both for our sake and for<pb n="65" facs="0085"
                            xml:id="pg_65"/> its own, that the American nation stands absolutely
                        united in the pursuit of the war.</p>
                    <p>I hope you can see your way to withdrawing the pamphlet from publication in
                        its present shape. There is no objection to your mentioning that “The Spirit
                        of America in the War” was written at the request of, or for the Committee
                        on Public Information, but it is more than inadvisable, it is incorrect, to
                        say that it was written “to be circulated as American propaganda in
                        Sweden.”</p>
                    <p>I think so much of your work, your personality, and your general attitude,
                        that I am extremely sorry to appear in the part of a critic, but I have no
                        choice in this matter.</p>
                    <p>Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible, I remain,</p>

                            Publications, wrote a note to <persName corresp="#p_SE_1"

                            philosophic sort of man and his use of the phrase ‘Propaganda in Sweden’
                            was purely a slip. Bjorkman is perfectly right in calling his attention
                            to it. I think he will straighten it out in the best way and with less
                            fuss and display than Bjorkman’s letter might suggest. I think their two
                            temperaments will neutralize each other so the matter will work out
                            amicably.” (Ibid.) <persName corresp="#p_SE_1">Sisson</persName> wrote a

                    <p>We are by no means ready to make final reports, but I write informally just
                        after our first real move since coming over.</p>
                    <p>We had a fast trip, a funny reception at the port of debarkation, a busy two
                        days in Paris, then <persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lippmann</persName> and I

                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>We expected to find three organized and working Inter-Allied Propaganda
                        Boards, one in Paris, one in London and one in Padua, which would be
                        landmarks in the field, with which we would have to deal and to which we
                        could immediately designate liaison officers. Those Boards are ghosts. This
                        afternoon we sat-in at a session of the so-called Board here. It is
                        essentially the new French Army Board for propaganda into enemy countries,
                        headed by Commandant Chaix,<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">Edmond Aimé Louis
                            Chaix.</note> and International only by virtue of the fact that an
                        Italian, an Englishman, three Belgians and three Americans (<persName
                            corresp="#p_GH_1">Hugh Gibson</persName>, <persName corresp="#p_LW_1"
                            >Lippmann</persName> and I) were present to hear what the French had
                        done and were planning. We were announced as having ideas. We declared
                        ourselves there to listen, not to exploit plans.</p>
                    <p>Here in a nutshell is the situation. The French at last are doing quite a
                        good deal of propaganda in a precise, intelligent fashion, freely playing
                        the American card as their trump, and mainly through the energy of Major
                        Chaix, a <persName corresp="#p_CG_1">Clemenceau</persName> personal
                        appointee, attempting to expand their efforts with an intensified air
                        program, greater use of smuggling through Switzerland, and reaching out to
                        touch off Albania and Bulgaria. All the propaganda the American Army has
                        distributed, be it noted, is this French propaganda, not “scrutinized by
                        myself” as specified by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1"
                            >Baker</persName>. The British in the second compartment of the nutshell
                        are also doing a good bit, mainly with balloons but not<pb n="67"
                            facs="0087" xml:id="pg_67"/> with aeroplanes. The Belgians are anxious
                        to have the whole program center around the distribution of Belgian
                        newspapers and literature. What the Italians are doing was not indicated at
                        the meeting today. All this means that there is considerable stirring of the
                        ground but no clear and scientific ploughing and not an American machine on
                        the whole farm.</p>
                    <p>For us the matter is simple! Far from being hampered by Allied activities, we
                        cannot even count on very effective help and must build up our own
                        organization. I think this is fortunate. It will mean slower work in the
                        start. Just now America is in the position of being so utterly laggard that
                        the American word which is the big noise in the propaganda field is being
                        spoken solely by our Allies. They are yelling it.</p>
                    <p>We are just beginning to forsee something of the size and character of the
                        various divisions of the organization which the Army will have to have. The
                        main use of our present force of course is to do the Intelligence job of
                        finding out what is needed. I had set August 15 as a date on which to send
                        back a first rough draft of organization and needs, but I suspect such date
                        will be nearer August 30. Much depends on the trip to London, which begins
                        the day after tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>All in the party are well. Many inquiries concerning you and the fortunes of
                        the Branch were addressed to us at G.H.Q. we just missed <persName

                        is fired these days with elation over the record of our men of July 4 and
                            14<note n="4" xml:id="d31fn4">July 4 was the Battle of Hamel, in which

                        and marvelous tales of unbelievable praise by men around Foch are current.

                    </list>
                    <p>1. During the past winter there was shown throughout Japan the film which
                        under the title “Battlecry of Peace” (?) was given much publicity in this
                        country during the campaign for preparedness two or three years ago. The
                        purpose of this film here was to dwell upon—even to exaggerate the military
                        impotence of the United States and one feature of it showed the sack of New
                        York City by an invading power. It is obvious that while the purpose of this
                        propaganda film in this country was not misunderstood, yet the Japanese
                        populace who saw it by thousands gained quite different impressions. An
                        additional bad feature lay in the fact that it is a Japanese custom to have
                        an “explainer” (benshi) who conducts an explanatory monologue while a film
                        is being shown. It may be inferred that in the present instance the benshi
                        everywhere rose to the occasion as patriotic Japanese.</p>

                    <p>2. It occurs to the writer that it would be well worth while to provide for
                        some such counter action to the impression produced by the film mentioned by
                        providing for the immediate production in Japan of the Official film
                        “America’s Answer.”<note n="2" xml:id="d33fn2">For <hi rend="italic"
                                >America’s Answer</hi>, please see the Online Supplement, Appendix
                            A.5.</note>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. The Universal Film Company is the largest organization in Japan, having
                        many theatres all over the country which it supplies. The national agent in
                        Tokyo is thoroughly loyal and anxious to serve the United States and without
                        doubt would be glad of the opportunity to put on this film.</p>
                    <p>4. To short-circuit the <hi rend="italic">benshi</hi> it would be advisable
                        to have the “titles” done in Japanese. The writer will be glad to take the
                        personal responsibility for this end of the matter if the proposal is
                        approved.</p>
                    <p>5. The growing chauvinism in Japan incident to the dispatch of troops into
                        Siberia makes it advisable that such a project be carried out soon.<note
                            n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">On August 3, the United States announced that it
                            was dispatching troops to Vladivostok in cooperation with Japan “to
                            render such protection and help as is possible to the Czecho-Slovaks
                            against the armed Austrian and German prisoners who are attacking them
                            and to steady any efforts at self-government or self-defense in which
                            the Russians themselves may be willing to accept assistance.” (<ref

                    <p>Recurring to what I spoke of for a moment yesterday in our little war
                            conference,<note n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Although no other record of

                        [illegible—activities?] I am very jealous about?</p>
                    <p>I am told that the War Department is, through its intelligence officers, in
                        some way interesting itself in the matter of propaganda abroad, and I would
                        be very much obliged if you would make inquiry and find how far this is true
                        and what is being attempted, because it is my wish to keep the matter of
                        propaganda entirely in my own hands and I had not known that any other
                        agencies than those I had set up were attempting to interest themselves in
                        it. I regard nothing as more delicate or more intimately associated with the
                        policy of the administration than propaganda, and if any agency of the Army
                        is attempting to organize propaganda of any sort or to take a hand in
                        controlling it, I would be very much obliged if you would “call them off”.
                        You will know how to do so kindly and without intimating any criticism on my
                        part, but only my sense of the absolute necessity of my directing that whole
                        matter.</p>

                        handled by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName>
                        personally. The Secretary, after conferences with representatives of the
                        Bureau of Public Information; and with the Military Intelligence Division,
                        at which the Chief of Staff was present; and in response to the initiation
                        of this propaganda by the Bureau of Public Information, directed the
                        organization of the party consisting of Captain <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                            >Blankenhorn</persName>, Captain <persName corresp="#p_LW_1"
                            >Lippman</persName>, Lieutenant Merz and Lieutenant Ifft. These officers
                        were to proceed to France to carry out confidential instructions which were
                        given to them by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> in
                        person. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> also wrote
                        to General <persName corresp="#p_PJJ_1">Pershing</persName> a letter in
                        which he defined the objects of this mission and gave General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PJJ_1">Pershing</persName> necessary instructions as to his
                        attitude toward it.</p>
                    <p>A part of the propaganda proposed consisted of getting into the territorial
                        limits of the Central Powers certain information concerning activities of
                        the United States in connection with the war. The Bureau of Public
                        Information has not been able to successfully get such information into
                        Germany and Austria hitherto. The scheme involved the preparation of certain
                        propaganda matter which Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1"
                            >Baker</persName> proposed to visé himself or have viséd by responsible
                        officers who would carry out his policy in the matter, so as to prevent
                        exaggerated statements being used in the propaganda.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the general scheme, the War Department has placed orders
                        for a number of balloons of small dimensions, which it is proposed to start
                        toward German territory from a base with the American Expeditionary Force
                        when the wind is favorable, these balloons having a relatively small radius
                        of travel so that they will be sure to get to land within the limits of the
                        Empire of the Central Powers. The orders for these balloons have actually
                        been placed and the carrying out of the general scheme of this propaganda
                        would be impossible<pb n="73" facs="0093" xml:id="pg_73"/> without the
                        coordinated work of the military establishment. You will recall that in
                        order to obtain the money for the purchase of these balloons, it was
                        necessary to ask you for $76,000 from your war fund and this money was
                        allotted by you for this purpose at the personal solicitation of Secretary
                            <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName>, and it was understood
                        that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName> acted at the same time
                        in obtaining this amount.</p>
                    <p>Captain <persName corresp="#p_LW_1">Lippman</persName> was placed upon this
                        committee at the suggestion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1"
                            >Baker</persName> himself. The committee arrived abroad and shortly
                        after its arrival in France a cablegram was received from General <persName
                            corresp="#p_PJJ_1">Pershing</persName> announcing in general terms that
                        the committee apparently was well selected for the purpose in hand.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with your instructions, orders have been given to the senior
                        officer of this committee, Captain <persName corresp="#p_BH_1"
                            >Blankenhorn</persName>, to discontinue any further activity and to
                        report to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> upon his
                        arrival. A cablegram has also been sent to Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> to be delivered to him upon his
                        arrival, announcing what your action has been in this matter and it is
                        expected, as the entire matter was handled by Secretary <persName
                            corresp="#p_BND_1">Baker</persName> personally, that he will then
                        communicate with you concerning it.</p>
                    <p>While the War Department, of course, intends to carry out exactly what you
                        desire in this matter, it would seem that the field for propaganda of the
                        class indicated could only be reached by the assistance of the military
                        establishment. In propaganda work in other countries the Military
                        Intelligence Division has never assumed any control or direction. The
                        Military Attachés at Madrid, Berne, and other places have been told to place
                        themselves at the disposal of the representatives of the Bureau of Public
                        Information and to cooperate with them to any extent that they desire, but
                        they have never attempted to initiate any such propaganda themselves.</p>

                    <p>2. In this connection it is desired to inform you that our own relations with
                        the Committee here in Washington are the very best that can possibly exist.

                        the Committee are both serving on numerous committees where there is a
                        complete and satisfactory understanding and exchange of views. Our liaison
                        between ourselves and the Committee’s Office and representatives in
                        Washington is complete in every detail, and a very frank and agreeable
                        exchange of information and data is carried on every day.</p>
                    <p>3. We keep one thing and one thing only in mind, and that is that we are all
                        members of a common cause and are all working together in the interests of
                        the United States looking towards a successful conclusion of the war in
                        which we are now engaged.</p>

                        liberty of going over the various points that have been brought to our

                    </p>
                    <p>5. The differences that have been brought to our attention are, that having
                        known of available space for committee offices you did not inform the
                        representative, although requested to do so. That you did not cooperate in
                        the attempt to have the premises requisitioned by the Italian government.
                        That you kept Kingsley Moses for a month as a clerk after the Ambassador had
                        been persuaded to bring him from Foggia for Captain Merriam. That in the
                        absence of the Ambassador, Moses was transferred to your office for work as
                        a clerk, while he was acting as head of the Speakers Bureau there. That you
                        declined to furnish blocks of passes to the C.P.I. representative for <gloss
                            target="#t_YMCA_1">Y.M.C.A.</gloss> and Red Cross with the result that
                        they are inconvenienced and pay money for speakers who might take slightly
                        different routes from those deemed necessary when starting from Rome.</p>
                    <p>6. While we do not ask for a report on the above mentioned matters, we do
                        think that a closer cooperation would be productive probably of better
                        results. Plainly speaking, what we want is that you and Captain Merriam get
                        together and iron out all the difficulties or misunderstandings that may
                        possibly exist.</p>
                    <p>7. Another report is to the effect that you did not notify the Committee’s
                        representative of the arrival of troops at Genoa, thus preventing proper
                        publicity and the taking of moving pictures, although requested to do so.
                        Also that you failed to notify them of the arrival of troops from France,
                        with the same effect, although requested.</p>
                    <p>8. With respect to these last items, it may be possible that you were acting
                        under orders to maintain secrecy with respect to these movements, or that
                        there may have been some other good and well founded reason for not
                        informing the Committee’s representative. This, of course, we are unable to
                        judge from this distance.</p>

                    <p>9. In closing, we do, however, wish to once again call your attention to the
                        necessity of the very closest cooperation that can possibly be had, and by
                        so doing you will receive and have the full support of this your Home

                    <p>I take pleasure in transmitting herewith the Japanese version of the titles

                            doubts however as to whether the allusion to tyrants and tyranny will
                            pass the Japanese censor. If the whole title were out it would not make
                            a great deal of difference.</item>

                    <p>I want to give you my reasons why it seems to me, from over a year’s
                        constructive work as director of this division, that work along these lines
                        should be continued on a permanent basis as a part of our government’s
                        administration in relation to foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>As to my own part in such work—while feeling it a privilege to have served in
                        this way during the war and assuring you of my willingness to continue
                        serving through the coming three or four months of world wide discussion, if
                        you care to have me do so—I shall then expect to be relieved, to continue my
                        work as a writer. The work here is for an editor. I know that my own value
                        is much greater as a writer, and I feel that for the kind of writing that I
                        wish to do, there will be a large field of usefulness in the years ahead. My
                        feeling is strong in this matter and my decision final.</p>
                    <p>My opinion is, however, that in some manner this work should go on. You may
                        say that work of this kind belongs to the State Department. Perhaps it does,
                        and it seems to me that a bureau along these lines should either be attached
                        to the State Department or at least cooperate closely with it both here and
                        in foreign countries, as we have been doing during the war. But the need of
                        such work being permanent appears to me plain and urgent. If we are entering
                        an era of more and more open diplomacy, in order to make the policies of
                        this government most effective abroad we must use the legitimate methods of
                        publicity to reach widely the great masses of people in other countries with
                        the significant facts about the life and purposes of this nation. To present
                        such facts widely we need men especially trained in reaching the large
                        public by presentation in popular form.</p>
                    <p>Such work is by no means simple. If the proposed League of Nations becomes a
                        reality, countless questions will arise of such immediate moment that this
                        nation will need to present quickly to all countries its policy on each
                        question, the reasons for its policy, and also the support of such policy by
                        the nation at large, as evidenced in <gloss target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                        editorials, statements of prominent citizens, organizations, etc. There<pb
                            n="81" facs="0101" xml:id="pg_81"/> may be certain great crises where
                        the delay of a few days or even hours in the transmission of such news will
                        work considerable harm. The prompt and accurate work required will need a
                            <hi rend="italic">cable service</hi> from the <gloss target="#t_US_1"
                            >U.S.</gloss> reaching out all over the world.</p>
                    <p>Again, this nation will doubtless have many large aims and policies of a more
                        permanent nature for which it wishes to build up support in the court of
                        world opinion. For this it will rely, I presume, not on a tremendous army
                        but on a campaign of fair and open discussion throughout the world.
                        Moreover, as in each nation the trend seems to be more and more toward
                        democracy, the need will increase for a wider and wider appeal to the great
                        masses of people in each land, in the building up of such friendly support.
                        This will require a <hi rend="italic">mail service</hi> here, an adequate
                        staff in this country to gather news and opinion to a much fuller extent
                        than the limited cable service can do.</p>
                    <p>Such a mail service would also write or edit articles of all kinds dealing
                        with significant aspects of our national life and growth, and would
                        illustrate some of the best possible photographs, cuts, mats, etc. Such work
                        will be of the first importance—for to gain agreement abroad with our
                        foreign policies we must gain the good will of the world and arouse a
                        friendly interest in all the aspects of life and work in the <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss>
                    </p>
                    <p>For this part of the work there will be needed a large <hi rend="italic">film
                            service</hi> as well—for I believe that every year the medium of films
                        will be used more and more to reach the hundreds of millions of people for
                        whom the moving pictures make a much stronger appeal than does the written
                        article.</p>
                    <p>So much for the home part of the service. There will also be needed in each
                        of the countries men able wisely to select from the cabled and written
                        material sent them, and translate it in colloquial style—men thoroughly
                        familiar with the means of distribution in that country through the daily
                        press, the weekly and monthly periodicals, technical journals, window
                        display, photographs, lectures, film theatres, etc.</p>
                    <p>All this, of course, should be done in cooperation with the embassies or
                        legations abroad and in harmony with the policy of our State Department.</p>
                    <p>Such a service, however, if it is to be of real value, must not be of the
                        “official propaganda” sort which has been employed recently by many foreign
                        governments. Although it must be reliable and strictly in conformity with
                        the policies of our State Department, it must be more than this. It must be
                        a service so well written, in the foreign style, so well edited and planned,
                        that foreign editors will use it widely because of their certainty that it
                        will interest their readers. Nothing will more quickly prevent such use than
                        a service evidently “propaganda” and “official.” Remember that in years to
                        come, as the nations [are] brought together, in each country more and more
                        news, from<pb n="82" facs="0102" xml:id="pg_82"/> other lands will compete
                        for a place in newspapers and magazines. Our material must therefore be put
                        into the most presentable form.</p>
                    <p>You may be sure that other nations will continue and increase the work of
                        this kind which they are already undertaking in a much larger way than we
                        have done. And when such nations develop policies hostile to our own, they
                        will campaign in this way against us, and their points will have to be met
                        unless we are willing to suffer defeat in each big national purpose.</p>
                    <p>It will also be urgent to clear away all points of misunderstanding or
                        misconception that already prevail or will arise in foreign countries in
                        regard to this nation, its life, work, ideals and opinions, its purposes
                        both here and abroad. This means that we must inform foreign countries not
                        only on current news and opinion here, but that also through various
                        articles and pamphlets of authoritative opinion and interpretation we must
                        inform them of the growth in past years, of certain chief aims and
                        tendencies of ours as they now affect the outside world. In brief, we shall
                        have to explain to them in popular form not only our present but our
                        past.</p>
                    <p>Also it will tremendously help such new democracies as will probably arise in
                        Russia, through the Balkans, Central Europe and elsewhere, if we can send
                        them sound practical articles giving them the benefit of our experience
                        during the long slow process of building up a democracy here. They will be
                        eager to learn of all the various ways and means, both political and
                        industrial, by which we have steered a safe course between the extremes of
                        autocracy and anarchy, the methods found to be practical in self-government
                        of all kinds, how our government is able to help the people and how the
                        people control the government—both federal, state and municipal. All such
                        material, presented through popular but authoritative articles, through
                        pictures, films, etc. will be immensely valuable to liberal groups in each
                        country who are trying to steer the same safe middle course. There are signs
                        that the world is entering now a critical stage of transition with dangers
                        of reaction on one side and Bolshevism on the other. It will greatly promote
                        the safety of true democracy everywhere if the liberal groups in each
                        country can be thoroughly informed of each other’s work.</p>
                    <p>Just to give one example, it will help the Russian liberals if we can show,
                        by articles, pictures and especially films to the millions of Russian
                        peasants, the life of the American farmer, his use of modern machinery,
                        schools for his children, automobiles, newspapers, rural delivery and all
                        the other advantages he enjoys. Our embassy and consular service in Russia
                        as at present organized is not adequate for this task. It will mean, through
                        papers, periodicals, agricultural journals, lectures, film theatres, etc.
                        reaching out to all classes of people there and showing them what we have
                        done and are doing, giving them the benefit both<pb n="83" facs="0103"
                            xml:id="pg_83"/> of our successes and mistakes in the many experiments
                        we have made, picturing the life of our farmers and our workingmen, our
                        children in cities and villages, our free schools and colleges, all kinds of
                        free education here, public health work of all kinds, work of industrial
                        welfare. It will be especially urgent to overcome a widely prevailing
                        opinion in Russia that our exporters are looking on Russia as a field for
                        huge and unfair profits in the future. We must show our real purpose, which
                        will be, I suppose, to open up legitimate trade connections on a basis of
                        mutual advantage.</p>
                    <p>Again in our approach to the peoples of Germany and Austria it will be of the
                        utmost importance quickly and convincingly to explain to them what attitude
                        we decide to take, in order to avoid on the one hand any danger of another
                        German militarism arising and on the other hand to meet the menace of a
                        permanently embittered nation that might become a breeding ground for
                        trouble in Europe in the generations to come.</p>
                    <p>Our foreign trade to all countries will doubtless have an immense expansion
                        in the near future. With this will go a great advertising campaign abroad
                        conducted by exporters here through their export journals to foreign
                        countries, through window displays, through foreign newspapers and all other
                        possible mediums. They will use every possible device, including films, to
                        promote their campaigns. The pictures they give of American life and
                        national aims will closely affect our relations with such foreign countries,
                        and should therefore, it seems to me, be balanced and controlled by the
                        friendly cooperation of this government in all such campaigns, so as to
                        insure against possible blunders and misstatements. For upon our commerce
                        will depend the good or bad will toward us that will arise throughout the
                        world. This will be especially true in the near future when the world will
                        have special need of our manufactured products. In many countries it has
                        been said by hostile propagandists that we are to become a huge
                        imperialistic commercial power using our domination in ways unfair to other
                        nations in the world’s market. Such attacks need to be answered by a
                        campaign to show our real policy—a free field for all.</p>
                    <p>It will be the same with our food products. For years to come the world will
                        face a shortage of food and will be eager to know the extent of our supplies
                        of such products. It will immeasurably strengthen the good will of the world
                        toward this country if we can show both the abundance of our resources and
                        our generous purpose to share to the greatest possible extent our bounty
                        with others who need it most. In this connection I have already spoken of
                        how the life of the farmer can be used to show to other people what a free
                        but orderly government can do for the man who tills the soil. Such
                        informative work means reaching not only the popular press but also
                        agricultural journals.</p>
                    <pb n="84" facs="0104" xml:id="pg_84"/>
                    <p>Again, in the field of education it will immensely increase the good will
                        toward us if we can keep other countries informed of the thousands of young
                        men and women who will doubtless be trained in our schools and colleges to
                        go abroad in all kinds of foreign work connected with our industries,
                        commerce, education, etc. Moreover, if there is to be a more liberal and
                        brotherly world, no better means of building it up could be found than to
                        bring together the teachers of all countries in a great international
                        exchange of ideas of all kinds as to the education of children and the
                        moulding of the citizen who will run the world of tomorrow. This can perhaps
                        best be done through the world’s educational journals. In this field we have
                        much to offer in the way of suggestions drawn from our experience in our
                        educational system, federal, state and municipal. But we have also much to
                        learn. And certainly, in all parts of such a service, we should take pains
                        to avoid any too superior attitude. We should show ourselves ready and eager
                        to learn. Some say that in the coming age the one great word will be
                        Education. If so, it is certainly urgent to provide a means by which the
                        best ideas of each country can be given at once to all the rest.</p>
                    <p>This applies also to the field of medical service and public health. For the
                        popular and medical press abroad we should describe all such activities here
                        that may be valuable suggestions for public health in other countries and we
                        should also show how we benefit here from the many suggestions from abroad.
                        In this section, we should show our willingness to help in all kinds of
                        relief and reconstruction work in Europe, and in this field we can also show
                        our own essential democracy, in the great progress that all movements for
                        public health have made over here in the last twenty years. Also in every
                        possible way should be shown how the new international order can help the
                        progress of medical science and how medical science can strengthen the new
                        international order.</p>
                    <p>To promote such special news exchange, in the more important foreign
                        countries, as now we have a commercial attache at our embassies or
                        legations, it might be well to add educational, agricultural and possibly
                        medical attaches as well.</p>
                    <p>At any rate there should be in each important foreign country a Bureau of the
                        kind here described, with cable, mail and film divisions, cooperating with
                        our consular and diplomatic service. And here in the United States there
                        should be the same three divisions to gather and send the material.</p>
                    <p>As for the actual organization, I can make suggestions only for the mail
                        division, in which I have had experience here.</p>
                    <p>Briefly, in this office we have been organized as follows. First, we have a
                        news feature service made up of extracts and “re-writes” from about 200
                        daily newspapers from all sections of the United States and<pb n="85"
                            facs="0105" xml:id="pg_85"/> giving all shades of opinion; also from
                        several hundred general and technical magazines, trade journals, etc., as
                        well as from all sorts of federal and state government reports, and reports
                        of private organizations.</p>
                    <p>We have also special men here dealing with various fields of activities, such
                        as agriculture, food conservation, industry and finance, labor, education,
                        religion, medicine.</p>
                    <p>In connection with these is a section supplying to hundreds of <gloss
                            target="#t_US_1">U.S.</gloss> exporters printed and picture material to
                        be distributed by them in the hundreds of thousands of business letters,
                        catalogues, etc. which they send to foreign countries.</p>
                    <p>In addition, we have had on our staff or connected with this Bureau men with
                        a special knowledge of Russia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Holland, France,
                        England, Spain, Italy, Austria, Germany and also Latin American
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we have an art department which produces photographs, cuts, mats,
                        etc. to illustrate articles, and large re-prints to be placed in the several
                        thousand shop windows now available to us in foreign countries; also posters
                        and picture post-cards showing forth war aims and activities.</p>
                    <p>Some such organization perhaps might be valuable as a basis to build on.</p>
                    <p>I have not tried to set all this out in order or in any detail but merely to
                        make suggestions for what seems to me a tremendous need. I hope that if this
                        meets with the approval of the government, minds far abler than my own will
                        combine my suggestions with others and draw up a strong and adequate system
                        of publicity work abroad, without which it seems to me that the effort to
                        build a new international order will meet with little or no success in the
                        critical years ahead.</p>
                    <p>Should some such plan be adopted, there exists in our records here a vast
                        wealth of suggestion for one who is to build up on a permanent basis such a
                        service for the United States. There are also, I think, some men on this
                        staff who would be exceedingly valuable for such work if they could be
                        persuaded to undertake it. For the main direction of such a service I know
                        of no one more fitted than yourself.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                        <salute>Dear Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CG_2">Creel</persName>:</salute>
                    </opener>
                    <p>We understand that Select Pictures plans to release on December 1st, a five
                        reel subject, THE ROAD THROUGH THE DARK featuring Clara Kimball Young.</p>
                    <p>We reviewed a copy of this picture at our office on November 23rd, and beg to
                        advise that many of its features make it objectionable both for exhibition
                        in the United States, and for export to other countries.</p>
                    <p>In this picture Clara Kimball Young plays the part of Gabrielle, a French
                        girl, in love with an American student. The scene is laid in France. To
                        separate Gabrielle from her lover, her parents send her to live with an aunt
                        in a village on the Meuse. She corresponds with her lover by means of a love
                        code which makes their letters appear innocent to her parents.</p>
                    <p>This picture is prejudicial to the French because it shows the inhabitants of
                        this village as offering no resistance to the Hun invaders. Gabrielle’s aunt
                        gives her gold with which to buy off the Huns “as they did in 1870”.</p>
                    <p>This picture also makes a very strong bid for sympathy for Germany. It shows
                        the German officer too honorable to accept gold. He prevents a private from
                        carrying off Gabrielle. He treats her with great kindness and consideration.
                        Acts of barbarism and the attempted burning of the village are portrayed as
                        committed by privates, contrary to explicit orders from the Imperial
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The German officer, Von Strelitz, takes Gabrielle as his mistress to Berlin.
                        So far as the audience can tell, she turns pro-German. The last few hundred
                        feet of the picture reveal that she has been acting as a spy for the allies
                        all through the picture and communicating the information which she gathers
                        to her American lover by means of their love code.</p>
                    <p>The presence of many laboratory titles in the print which we projected
                        indicates that this picture has under-gone a drastic revision, to adapt it
                        to the change in the military situation. As it stands the<pb n="87"
                            facs="0107" xml:id="pg_87"/> picture abounds in technical errors and is
                        wholly inconsistent with American public opinion.</p>
                    <p>Capt. Gleason’s<note n="2" xml:id="d41fn2">Not further identified.</note>
                        office of the Military Intelligence is acquainted with these facts having
                        viewed the picture with us. We hope to see a complete copy of this picture
                        before it is released and to receive complete title sheets so that we can
                        discuss the picture more in detail.<note n="3" xml:id="d41fn3">The film was

                        call attention to importance of its store house just now. The store is in
                        charge of a Russian who has opened a branch in the city where American
                        publications are given out and he has often fifty calls daily for them.
                        Recently he circulated this district with some publications and a letter
                        requesting recipient to advise if he wished further publication of bureau
                        and inquiring in what he was especially interested. Henceforth letters were
                        sent to representative people from lists secured from Zemstvos cooperatives
                        and other reliable sources and replies now being received evince much
                        interest. A Russian from the front called on me yesterday stating he had
                        seen press bureau pamphlet concerning Imperial Government of Germany in
                        Russia, that this pamphlet was in great demand and he had called to see how
                        many copies he could get for front where publications explaining present
                        situation in Russia are so needed. In the present lack of understanding of
                        our attitude toward Russia it seems unfortunate to draw out [<hi

                            Presumably it signifies an omission or garbled text in the transmission

                        of this present time. Most likely withdrawal of such a work will cause much
                        comment because of the recent publicity given it through letters mentioned.
                        The press has already stated that this action is with the mobilization plans
                        of the allies which makes appear that our interest in Russia in this respect
                        was only account of loans and it would seem that America cannot afford to
                        demobilize such institutions in Russia at this stage”.</p>

                        will mean that still another wonderful opportunity to do work helpful alike
                        to Russia and to America has [been] allowed to pass. The <gloss
                            target="#t_Compub_1">Compub</gloss> was doing splendid work in
                        interpreting America to the Russians and this work was sure to prove very
                        helpful not only to Russia but to the farmer the laborers and the business
                        men of America but the mistake that has been made in demobilizing the <gloss
                            target="#t_Compub_1">Compub</gloss> can still be largely remedied if the
                        help it was doing shall be carried on by other American agencies in Russia.
                        Very much can be done in the way of revival of the Russian newspapers in
                        both news and editorial columns from the spread of interesting helpful news
                        about America. This work can be done to a large extent by Consular Officers
                        on their own initiative. What is needed is patience tact work with the
                        owners and editors of daily papers. Had no serious trouble as Vice Consul in
                        getting practically all <gloss target="#t_Compub_1">Compub</gloss> material
                        into the Orenburg and Novo Nicolaevsk dailies and the cooperative magazines.
                        I also succeeded in getting the leading daily of Novo Nicolaevsk to publish
                        a special American number. This thirteen long articles in it about
                        America”.</p>

                        Ekaterinburg says “at first I thought little of the <gloss
                            target="#t_Compub_1">Compub</gloss> but always tried to help along as
                        far as possible. But after looking into the question more closely and having
                        seen their work while Brown was here I have come to think much in their work
                        and certainly believe it should be continued if at all possible. I gave
                            <gloss target="#t_Compub_1">Compub</gloss> representative here a letter
                        in which I expressed regret that his work had been so unexpectedly cut off,
                        that I believe the <gloss target="#t_Compub_1">Compub</gloss> was the basis
                        of a great trade getting movement and that I had hoped that finally it might
                        be fused into and become part some sort of a practical organization or
                        perhaps better call it information office and that I felt in this way they
                        would do good for America. At least they were getting well into connection
                        not only this people here and especially with the papers but were reaching a
                        class of people in the district which is not a reader of newspapers and yet
                        is to my mind a class of potential bulk not to be neglected. I believe
                        however, that telegraph service should be improved as we generally get news
                        too late <hi rend="italic">peddle</hi> out here. The <gloss

                        THE DIVISION OF FILMS OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INFORMATION.</p>
                    <p>Upon my arrival in Stockholm on April 1, 1918, from Petrograd where I had
                        been connected with the Committee’s office, I was appointed to take charge
                        of the distribution of American official films in Sweden, Norway and
                        Denmark. Upon investigation of the situation I found that an immense amount
                        of German propaganda and drama films were being presented in the picture
                        theatres throughout these countries. The Scandinavians like films very much
                        and to the large attendance at the five hundred odd theatres was constantly
                        being conveyed a broad influence—always of course, for the German point of
                        view. The propaganda films showed the success of the Germans and Austrians,
                        scenes in German cities, munition factories, etc., all tending to
                        demonstrate how Germany was winning the war. And there was absolutely no
                        representation as to what the United States was doing. In Sweden,
                        particularly, the German film propaganda was especially damaging toward the
                        existence of any ideas of fair neutrality for the reason that the Swedes
                        were practically all inclined to be pro-German and the influence of these
                        films was a constant stimulus in the same direction.</p>
                    <p>I foresaw that our films would have to be forced upon the theatres and
                        distributing companies in some way. The supply of American drama films in
                        the country was limited on account of the embargo that had existed, which
                        for a time, had excluded the possibility of importing films from the United
                        States. This condition had made it easy for the German film producers to get
                        in their product but they sold only with the provision that some German
                        propaganda subjects would be taken with the drama films.</p>
                    <p>After conferences with the representatives of the War Trade Board in
                        Stockholm, Christiania and Copenhagen I formulated the following plan which
                        in its operation practically drove German propaganda and<pb n="92"
                            facs="0112" xml:id="pg_92"/> drama films from the Scandinavian market.
                        Shortly before my arrival in Stockholm, the export prohibition on American
                        drama films had been provisionally raised and shipments again began to
                        come—addressed to the American Legations in the various countries. Before
                        releasing these to the consignees, they signed agreements that the films
                        would never be shown in any programme with a German drama or propaganda film
                        and that one reel of official American would always be shown with them. This
                        agreement they in turn made with the theatres before distributing. The three
                        largest companies controlling theatres in Scandinavia further agreed that
                        they would never permit any films previously received to be shown in the
                        same programme with German subjects. Inasmuch as American films were much
                        more popular with the public on account of their superiority, the effect of
                        these agreements were quickly evident. German films were gradually forced
                        out to such an extent that in three months after my arrival it was difficult
                        to find a theatre showing German drama films and the German propaganda films
                        had been completely driven out and replaced by our official films. I kept a
                        close check on the programmes throughout the three countries and in the few
                        instances where theatres did not keep their agreement and showed a German
                        film their ability to get American film was discontinued.</p>
                    <p>During the eight months I was in Scandinavia, I distributed about 100,000
                        feet of official films. This included American industrial subjects;
                        Hearst-Pathe and Universal Weeklies showing the Allies war activities and
                        events in the United States; “<persName corresp="#p_PJJ_1"

                        Review. These pictures were first shown in the best theatres of the
                        capitals—Stockholm, Christiania and Copenhagen and then went in rotation to
                        the smaller houses in these cities and afterward throughout the other cities
                        and towns of the three countries. Thus, where previously this immense number
                        of theatregoers had received pictured war news, only through German eyes
                        they now saw what we were doing, and, in the industrial subjects, the big
                        American interests, and the drama films thoroughly American in subject and
                        characters instead of German.</p>
                    <p>In the motion picture announcements of a recent copy of a Stockholm newspaper
                        I noticed that out of twelve theatres, eleven were showing completely
                        American programmes and one French, but no German films were announced.
                        Apparently German lines have not come back although it is several months
                        since our control ended.</p>
