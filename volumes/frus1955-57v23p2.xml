                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United States</hi> series presents
                    the official documentary historical record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant diplomatic activity of the United States Government.
                    The series documents the facts and events that contributed to the formulation of
                    policies and includes evidence of supporting and alternative views to the policy
                    positions ultimately adopted.</p>
                <p>The Historian of the Department of State is charged with the responsibility for
                    the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations series</hi>. The
                    staff of the Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs, plans,
                    researches, compiles, and edits the volumes in the series. This documentary
                    editing proceeds in full accord with the generally accepted standards of
                    historical scholarship. Official regulations codifying specific standards for
                    the selection and editing of documents for the series were promulgated by
                    Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg on March 26, 1925. A statutory charter for
                    the preparation of the series was established by Title IV of the Department of
                    State’s Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 USC 4351 <hi rend="italic">et
                        seq.</hi>), added by Section 198 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act
                    for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 (<gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 102–138),
                    which was signed by President George Bush on October 28, 1991.</p>
                <p>The statute requires that the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be
                    a thorough, accurate, and reliable record of major United States foreign policy
                    decisions and significant United States diplomatic activity. The volumes of the
                    series should include all records needed to provide comprehensive documentation
                    of major foreign policy decisions and actions of the United States Government,
                    including facts which contributed to the formulation of policies and records
                    providing supporting and alternative views to the policy positions ultimately
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The statute confirms the editing principles established by Secretary Kellogg: the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series is guided by the principles
                    of historical objectivity and accuracy; records should not be altered or
                    deletions made without indicating in the published text that a deletion has been
                    made; the published record should omit no facts that were of major importance in
                    reaching a decision; and nothing should be omitted for the purposes of
                    concealing a defect in policy. The statute also requires that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series be published not more than 30
                    years after the events recorded.</p>

                <p>The volume presented here, which was originally compiled and prepared as a book
                    manuscript in 1977 and 1978, meets all the standards of selection and editing
                    prevailing in the Department of State at that time and complies fully with the
                    spirit of the standards of selection, editing, and range of sources established
                    by the statute of October 28, 1991. This volume records policies and events of
                    more than 30 years ago, but the statute allows the Department until 1996 to
                    reach the 30-year line in the publication of the series.</p>

                        Series</hi></p>
                <p>This volume is part of a triennial subseries of volumes of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series that documents the most important issues in
                    the foreign policy of administration of President <persName>Dwight D.
                        Eisenhower</persName> during the years 1955–1957. This subseries comprises
                    27 print volumes and 1 microfiche supplements.</p>
                <p>The documentation on relations with Korea presented in this volume was originally
                    combined with the documentation on relations with Japan in a single, large
                    volume when the manuscript was prepared in 1977 and 1978. The declassification
                    review of the Japan documentation proceeded more rapidly than the Korea
                    documentation. Because of the delay in declassifying the Korea documentation,
                    the editors divided the manuscript into two parts. The Department of State
                    released Volume XXIII, Part 1, Japan, in August 1991.</p>
                <p>The volume presented here, Part 2 of Volume XXIII, is the last to be published
                    for the 1955–1957 triennium and completes the record of U.S. foreign policy
                    toward the Far East (Volume I, Vietnam; Volumes II and III, China; Volume XXI,
                    East Asian Security, Cambodia, Laos; and Volume XXII, Southeast Asia). In
                    addition, Volume X, Foreign Aid and Economic Defense Policy, and Volume XIX,
                    National Security Policy, contain documentation with related themes and similar
                    issues.</p>

                    Series</hi></p>
                <p>The original research, compilation, and editing of this volume were done in 1977
                    and 1978 under the Department regulation derived from Secretary of State
                    Kellogg’s charter of 1925. This regulation prescribed that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Foreign Relations</hi> series include “a comprehensive record of the major
                    foreign policy decisions within the range of the Department of State’s
                    responsibilities.” The regulation further stipulated that the additional
                    required records “needed to supplement the documentation in the Department” be
                    obtained from other government agencies.</p>
                <p>The Department of State’s historians have had, for the series in general and for
                    the particular volume published here, complete and unconditional access to all
                    records and papers of the Department of <pb n="V" xml:id="pg_V" facs="0009"
                    />State: the central files of the Department; the files of the Department’s
                    Executive Secretariat which comprehended the official papers created by or
                    submitted to the Secretary of State; the special decentralized files (“lot
                    files”) of the Department at the bureau, office, and division levels; the files
                    of all overseas diplomatic and consular posts and U.S. special missions; and all
                    the official correspondence with foreign governments and with other Federal
                    agencies. Any failure to include a complete Department of State record in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series cannot be attributed to
                    constraints or limitations placed upon the Department historians in their access
                    to Department records, information security regulations and practices
                    notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>Department of State historians preparing the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series, including the volume published here, have enjoyed
                    full access to the papers of the Presidents and to all other White House foreign
                    policy records. All of this documentation has been made available for use in the
                    preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series thanks to the
                    exceptional cooperation and support of the National Archives and Records
                    Administration, its Office of Presidential Libraries, and the individual
                    Presidential library. The Department of State owes particular thanks for the
                    research of this volume to the staff of the <persName>Dwight D.
                        Eisenhower</persName> Library.</p>
                <p>In addition to Presidential correspondence and records of Presidential meetings
                    and conversations, the documentation in the White House files at the Eisenhower
                    Library were the most important sources for the preparation of the volume
                    published here. Department editors had full and complete access to all the
                    institutional documentation of the National Security Council (<gloss
                        target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>) including the memoranda of discussion at
                        <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meetings, formal <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                        >NSC</gloss> documents, and related papers. There was also full access to
                    the subject files of Presidential records (particularly the Whitman File), the
                    files of other White House officials, and more informal policy documentation in
                    other collections in the Eisenhower Library. It should be noted that the editors
                    supplemented the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> records from the Eisenhower
                    Library with documents in the Department of State files.</p>
                <p>The records preserved and maintained at the Presidential libraries include some
                    of the most significant foreign affairs documentation of other Federal agencies
                    such as the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the
                    Central Intelligence Agency. Department of State historians, with the
                    considerable cooperation of the various agencies, have obtained access to
                    records requested for possible inclusion in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes. Access to records of other agencies maintained at
                    the Presidential libraries has been supplemented by special research visits to
                    the historical files retained by these agencies or transferred to the National
                    Archives and Records Administration. Department historians have enjoyed steadily
                    broadened <pb n="VI" xml:id="pg_VI" facs="0010"/>access to the records of the
                    Department of Defense, particularly the records of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
                    the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
                <p>Completion of the declassification of this volume and the final steps of its
                    preparation for publication coincided with the development since early 1991 by
                    the Central Intelligence Agency in cooperation with the Department of State of
                    expanded access by Department historians to high-level intelligence documents
                    from among those records still in the custody of that Agency. The Department of
                    State chose not to postpone the publication of this long-delayed volume to
                    ascertain how such access might affect the scope of available documentation and
                    the changes that might be made in the contents of this particular volume. The
                    Department is, however, using this expanded access, as arranged by the <gloss
                        target="#t_CIA1">CIA</gloss>’s History Staff, for compilation of future
                    volumes in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series.</p>
                <p>The statute of October 28, 1991, requires that the published record in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series include all records needed to
                    provide comprehensive documentation of all the major foreign policy decisions
                    and actions of the United States Government. It further requires that government
                    agencies, departments, and other entities of the United States Government
                    cooperate with the Department of State Historian by providing full and complete
                    access to records pertinent to foreign policy decisions and actions and by
                    providing copies of selected records. Although prepared in compliance with an
                    earlier Department regulation, this volume was prepared in a manner fully
                    consonant with the standards and mandates for compilation contained in the 1991
                    statute.</p>

                <p>In selecting the documents for this volume, the editor has given primary
                    consideration to those records that would most fully explain the formulation and
                    execution of the major U.S. Government policies with respect to the Republic of
                    Korea. The policy recommendations to President Eisenhower and his decisions with
                    respect to government policies and actions are documented as fully as possible.
                    So also are the discussions and actions of the National Security Council and any
                    Presidential discussions of Korean policy with Cabinet-level officers. The

                    implement his decisions are also comprehensively documented.</p>
                <p>Correspondence and other exchanges of the U.S. Government with the Government of
                    the Republic of Korea, with the United Nations, <pb n="VII" xml:id="pg_VII"
                        facs="0011"/>and with other governments are included where such documents
                    were critically important in the policymakers’ understanding of the major
                    political and economic events in Korea or were clearly important to policy
                    formulation and execution at the White House and the Department of State. The
                    editor sought to include in the volume those documents that focused on such
                    overriding issues as U.S. concern for the consolidation of the institutions of
                    democratic government, assistance for the development of the Korean economy,
                    support for currency and financial reform, and decisions regarding the
                    modernization of the Korean armed forces. The editor also included selected
                    reports from intelligence agencies and from various diplomatic posts that
                    figured into the policymaking process.</p>
                <p>While including high-level policy papers on the nature and timing of military
                    assistance to the Republic of Korea and the major role the U.S. military had on
                    the broad formulation of policies, the editor has not sought to document the
                    details of military or naval assistance or the command and activities of the
                    military forces stationed in Korea or in support of Korea. The editor has also
                    not attempted to document the whole range of day-to-day relationships, issues,
                    and contacts between the United States and the Republic of Korea nor to present
                    the record of the establishment and conduct of diplomatic and consular missions
                    in Korea or the appointments to these missions or to the policymaking ranks in
                    Washington. Nor has the editor attempted to document the record of how Federal
                    agencies other than the White House, Department of State, Department of Defense,
                    and the Joint Chiefs of Staff contributed to the formulation, execution, or
                    support of diplomatic, political, economic, and cultural policies with respect
                    to the Republic of Korea.</p>
                <p>In selecting documents for this volume, the editor concentrated exclusively on
                    presenting previously classified or undisclosed records. Public statements and
                    agreements have not been included, but previously released information has been
                    appropriately identified to elucidate documents printed here for the first
                    time.</p>
                <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Editorial Methodology</hi></p>
                <p>The documents are presented chronologically according to Washington time.
                    Incoming telegrams from U.S. missions are placed according to time of receipt in
                    the Department of State or other receiving agency, rather than the time of
                    transmission; memoranda of conversation are placed according to the time and
                    date of the conversation, rather than the date the memorandum was drafted.</p>
                <p>Editorial treatment of the documents published in <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> series follows Office style guidelines, supplemented by
                    guidance from the General Editor and the chief technical editor. The source text
                    is reproduced as exactly as possible, including marginalia or <pb n="VIII"
                        xml:id="pg_VIII" facs="0012"/>other notations, which are described in
                    footnotes. Obvious typographical errors are corrected, but other mistakes and
                    omissions in the source text are corrected by bracketed insertions: a correction
                    is set in italic type; an addition in roman type. Bracketed insertions are also
                    used to indicate omitted text that deals with an unrelated subject (in roman
                    type) or that remains classified after declassification review (in italic
                    type).</p>

                <p>The declassification review of this volume resulted in the deletion of 4.3
                    percent of the documents originally compiled. Many small deletions within
                    documents relate to the introduction of modem weapons into Korea. Full denial of
                    six documents (listed below) relates to the implementation of contingency
                    planning and activities in Korea. Identifying information in some documents that
                    contained finished intelligence was denied, although the substance of that
                    intelligence was released and has been incorporated into editorial notes. The

                <p>The principle guiding declassification review is to release all information,
                    subject only to the current requirements of national security and law.
                    Declassification decisions entailed concurrence of the appropriate geographic
                    and functional bureaus in the Department of State, other concerned agencies of
                    the U.S. Government, and the appropriate foreign governments regarding specific
                    documents of those governments.</p>

                        <p>The failure of the Geneva Conference of 1954 to produce an agreed
                            political settlement of the Korean conflict left the Armistice
                            Agreement, signed as a temporary measure on July 27, 1953, as the
                            instrument governing relations between the two opposing sides in the
                            conflict. Implementation of the Armistice Agreement was monitored by the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, a four-nation panel composed of
                            representatives of Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, and Czechoslovakia,
                            which was established for that purpose. The Neutral Nations Supervisory
                            Commission employed permanent inspection teams at stipulated ports of
                            entry in Korea and had a mandate to investigate suspected violations
                            wherever they occurred. In practice, however, the operations of the
                            inspection teams were limited by the military sensitivity of the
                            contending Korean Governments, and violations of the Armistice were
                            difficult to prove. Increasingly, the United Nations Command and the
                            Republic of Korea came to believe that the military balance in Korea was
                            being upset by the clandestine introduction of advanced military
                            equipment into North Korea in violation of the Armistice Agreement. To
                            restore the military balance upon which they believed the security of
                            Korea depended, U.S. officials determined that the Armistice provisions
                            should be altered to permit an upgrading of military forces south of the
                            demilitarized zone to match that which was occurring in the north. A
                            necessary change, in the opinion of U.S. and South Korean officials, was
                            the elimination or curtailment of the functions of the Neutral Nations
                            Supervisory Commission. For prior documentation on this and other

                            The Ambassador explained that the letter was rather lengthy and
                            indicated that there were some differences of opinion between the
                            Republic of Korea and the United States with respect to implementation
                            of the rehabilitation program. The expression of these differences in
                            opinion, however, was sincere and they were minor in view of our
                            agreement on the basic rehabilitation objective.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary expressed his feeling that in recent months there had been
                            a betterment of relations between the United States and the Republic of
                            Korea. The Ambassador concurred, but stated that the Republic of Korea
                            was worried about implementation of the rehabilitation program in view
                            of the delays that had developed during the past difficulties and hoped
                            that every effort would be made to implement it fully before the fiscal
                            year ended. In this connection, he said that he had been assured by
                                <persName>Mr. Stassen</persName> that every effort would be made to
                            carry out the program. In response to the Secretary’s question, the
                            Ambassador replied that there had been an enormous economic buildup in
                            North Korea and that this was one reason the President seemed so
                            intransigent in his position on the need for developing industries.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> stated that the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (<gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>), that is the Polish and Czech members, were causing a
                            lot of trouble and some, the Republic of Korea believe, are really
                            Russians who have boldly taken pictures and even distributed leaflets.
                            In relation to the problem, he expressed concern at “tremendous <pb
                                n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0031"/>numbers” of Communists, narcotic
                            smugglers, and saboteurs coming in by land and sea. It was impossible,
                            he said, to police the entire land front and that agents as well as
                            refugees continue to cross the military demarcation line. The Republic
                            of Korea had proof that agents disguised as fishermen had also
                            entered.</p>
                        <p>On the question of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, Mr.
                                <persName>Jones</persName> pointed out that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had placed the Czechs and Poles
                            on that Commission under virtual house arrest and thus reduced, if not
                            eliminated, their potential for espionage. In addition, he explained to
                            the Ambassador that an approach had been made to the Swiss and Swedes in
                            an effort to induce them to withdraw their personnel on the <gloss

                                Sweden and Switzerland in December 1954. The effort was prompted in
                                part by continuing complaints by the Republic of Korea concerning
                                the operations of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in South

                            agreed that action initiated by the Swiss and Swedes was the most

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> urged the Secretary
                            to visit Korea during his trip to Bangkok. The Ambassador emphasized the
                            boost to the morale of the Korean people and the value of talks between
                            the President and the Secretary which would result from such a visit.
                            The Secretary explained that his schedule was very tight indeed, but
                            that he would give serious consideration to the Ambassador’s
                            request.</p>

                            project to whom unspecified, and said he had pigeonholed plan two months
                            ago greatly against better judgment but that <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> economic situation so impaired by exchange rate
                            fluctuation, especially as promoted by auction <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> dollars, that this arrangement not to be endured any
                            longer.</p>
                        <p>I believe I succeeded in talking him out of immediate action but it is
                            obvious from <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s remarks that
                            he is as unreconciled to exchange provisions of agreed minute as he was
                            prior to initialing thereof and that we shall have to contend further
                            with this attitude at early date (if not in connection with forthcoming
                            third auction). The President’s plan is of course economically fantastic
                            and situation complicated by fact that he honestly and sincerely
                            committed to views outlined above. He is however aware that his plan
                            would violate agreed minute, hence this reference to “writing a letter”
                            which would request modification of minute. His attitude also bears
                            directly on prospects of obtaining <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s support for various <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> collateral economic measures that must soon be taken
                            pursuant to minute if program is to succeed. For example, during same

                            thought in the views which you have expressed in your letter of December
                            29, 1954.<note n="2" xml:id="d8fn2">See <ref target="#d2fn3">footnote 3,
                                    Document 2</ref>.</note> And because we all respect your
                            judgment about the problems facing Korea, we have given most careful
                            consideration to all that you have said.</p>
                        <p>Your letter makes it clear that you feel that Korea is caught between the
                            threat of Communist aggression and a danger of renewed efforts by the
                            Japanese to dominate Korea. In response, I want to assure you that it is
                            the policy of the United States to do everything within our power to
                            preserve the independence of the Republic of Korea. What the United
                            States and other nations have done in the past few years, and are
                            pledged to do in the future, should also serve to reassure you and the
                            Korean people.</p>
                        <p>When the Armistice was concluded in Korea, the Sixteen Nations who fought
                            side by side with your own forces in repelling the aggression issued a
                                Declaration<note n="3" xml:id="d8fn3">The text of the Sixteen-Nation
                                Declaration on Korea, issued at Washington on July 27, 1953, is
                                printed in Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                                August 24, 1953, p. 247.</note> which made it clear that they would
                            not tolerate a renewal of Communist aggression. More recently, we have
                            brought into force a Mutual Defense Treaty between our two countries.
                            This Treaty evidences the deep concern of the United States for the
                            security of your country against aggression from whatever source. Taken
                            together, the Joint Policy Declaration and the Mutual Defense Treaty
                            constitute clear and positive warning to any potential aggressor. I do
                            not believe this warning will be taken lightly.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the extensive economic and military assistance the United
                            States has given and is continuing to give the Republic of Korea is a
                            substantial investment in the future of your country. The United States
                            is making this investment because it has confidence in the future of the
                            Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YCYD1">You</persName> mention certain underlying

                            United States Far East Air Force. Nothing could be further from the
                            case. We <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0040"/>intend to continue to do
                            all that we can to prevent Korea from falling prey to Communist

                            subversion. The lives of the Americans who died defending Korea, our

                            witness to the depth and breadth of our concern for the security of the

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YCYD1">You</persName> assert that the belief is
                            widespread in Asia, on both sides of the Iron Curtain, that the United
                            States bases its military and diplomatic policies for the Far East
                            primarily upon the preservation of Japan as the chief center of
                            resistance to Communism. Those who hold this belief are mistaken,
                            although there is no question that it is of the greatest importance that
                            Japan continue to be indissolubly linked to the Free World. The security
                            of the whole area—including the safety of Korea—would be seriously
                            threatened if the Communists were to succeed in subverting Japan.</p>
                        <p>But this fact does not derogate from the importance of Korea’s position
                            or the position of any other country of the Free World. This Government
                            believes that the threat of Communism in Asia is so great that each of
                            the free countries of Asia needs to contribute what it can in human or
                            material resources to the collective effort to resist that threat. But
                            these resources can be used effectively only if cooperation among the
                            free nations transcends all lesser differences of opinion.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I am very glad to be assured that you share our interest in
                            the restoration of a feeling of genuine harmony and friendship between
                            Japan and Korea. In this connection, the suggestion you make for a
                            tripartite treaty between Japan, Korea, and the United States seems to
                            me to be well worth further exploration. I am asking Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BEO1">Briggs</persName> to discuss this matter
                            with you so that we may have a fuller explanation of your ideas about
                            such a treaty.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the aid program I want to express my appreciation of your
                            indication of intent to abide strictly by the new arrangements we have
                            recently made<note n="5" xml:id="d8fn5">Reference is to the Agreed

                                discussed, the Agreed Minute stipulated U.S.-Korean cooperation in
                                military and economic aid programs totaling a maximum of $700
                                million for fiscal year 1955, programs designed to spur the recovery
                                of the Korean economy and to support Korean military forces totaling
                                720,000 personnel.</note> and to continue to work cooperatively with
                            the United States in the spirit of utmost sincerity. I, in turn, want to
                            reaffirm that it is the intention of the United States to do the same.
                            Doubtless new problems will continue to arise. My hope is <pb n="13"
                                xml:id="pg_13" facs="0041"/>that these problems can be worked out
                            without an adverse impact on the aid program. I am anxious that the
                            funds which the United States Congress has appropriated for the Korean
                            aid program should be spent in the way which will most efficiently
                            promote the economic and military strength of your country. I am
                            convinced that the arrangements we have jointly agreed to in the Minute
                            of Understanding, if carried out in letter and spirit, will insure that
                            the aid funds will be spent in a manner which will achieve that
                            objective.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I want to express my personal pleasure that you came

                        <p>Indications that difficulties are arising in carrying out the provisions
                            of the confidential annex of the Agreed Minute of Understanding with
                            respect to planned strength of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Army were clarified by officers working on Korean Affairs in Operations
                            Division of <gloss target="#t_Gndash31">G–3</gloss> in their briefing of
                                <persName>Mr. Norred</persName> on January 28. These officers asked
                            that the information they provided be closely held.</p>
                        <p>Standing in the way of establishing ten reserve divisions by the end of
                            1955 are construction difficulties, arising from the extremely ambitious
                            plans for the reserve submitted by the theater command. According to
                            these plans, each division would have a permanent cadre of about 2,000
                            on active duty and approximately 2,000 more per division on active duty
                            for training at any given time. Barracks and other necessary buildings
                            alone reportedly would cost approximately $255,000 per division, despite
                            the cheap cost of construction in Korea. Other costs would be
                            correspondingly heavy.</p>

                        <p>A second major problem is developing out of efforts to reduce the size of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces on active duty.
                            United States Army officers are already encountering opposition from the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military to the new <gloss
                                target="#t_TOandE1">TO and E</gloss> for a <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> “reinforced” division, inasmuch as it entails
                            substantial reduction of transport and other special units. According to
                            the plan of the theater command, even this “reinforced” division <gloss
                                target="#t_TOandE1">TO and E</gloss> would apply only to reserve
                            divisions. Divisions on active duty would use a <gloss
                                target="#t_TOandE1">TO and E</gloss> “standard” division, entailing
                            another heavy reduction. The “standard” division would have only six
                            infantry battalions. The missing elements, including three battalions,
                            needed to fill the “standard” division out to form a “reinforced”
                            division, would be put in reserve, but would be earmarked for particular
                            divisions and kept separate from the reserve divisions. The theater
                            command plan calls for a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army at the
                            end of 1957 consisting of nine “standard” divisions on active duty,
                            reserve “augmentations” for those divisions, and twenty-one “reinforced”
                            divisions in the reserve.</p>
                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> surely will be exercised by these
                            delays and reductions. Moreover, Operations Division of <gloss
                                target="#t_Gndash31">G–3</gloss> is having great difficulty in
                            defending the theater command’s plan from cuts by other Army agencies,
                            and is not itself trying to justify the plans in entirety. The Army
                            elements of the plan alone would require close to a billion dollars over
                            a two to three year period. There appears to be much feeling in the
                            United States Army agencies, shared in part by the officers in
                            Operations Division, that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army
                            is far out of proportion to those of more powerful states. It was
                            pointed out also that over half of the United States Army advisory
                            personnel throughout the world are in <gloss target="#t_KMAG1"
                                >KMAG</gloss>. The recent transfer of police advisory functions from
                                <gloss target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> to <gloss target="#t_KCAC1"
                                >KCAC</gloss> was the beginning of an effort to cut <gloss
                                target="#t_KMAG1">KMAG</gloss> down to a normal military advisory
                            group.</p>
                        <p>I think we should make every effort we can to emphasize the importance of
                            developing and maintaining <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                            strength. While my layman’s estimate of the military requirement would
                            lead me to place this emphasis on military grounds, we probably should
                            base our official views on the serious political and moral repercussions
                            in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of a shortcoming in meeting
                            our commitments. To permit administrative difficulties to impede the
                            establishment of the ten reserve divisions would be a breach of faith
                            with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> which I hope we will not
                            incur. We should urge that every effort be made to carry out our
                            commitments and that the reserve divisions be created at least on paper
                            and that strong efforts be made to make them real reserve units by the
                            end of the year. Particular emphasis on building the reserve is needed
                            because of the clear implication in the Agreed Minute that divisions
                            will not be removed from active duty until a trained reserve has been
                            prepared. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army is now a <pb
                                n="15" xml:id="pg_15" facs="0043"/>highly effective military
                            instrument, developed by nine years of advisory activity by the United
                            States and three years of heavy fighting side by side with United States
                            and other Western forces, and we should certainly be slow to dissipate
                            its strength in these critical times.</p>

                                            combat aircraft, armoured vehicles, weapons, and
                                            ammunition,” unless it was to replace damaged or
                                            worn-out equipment, and then only “on the basis of
                                            piece-for-piece of the same effectiveness and the same
                                            type.” The Military Armistice Commission and the Neutral
                                            Nations Supervisory Commission were given broad scope,
                                            under the Armistice, to monitor the flow of military
                                            personnel and equipment into Korea. For text of the

                            the Department of Defense.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> indicated that
                            the concern of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stems from the fact that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander, General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>, feared an incident in South
                            Korea which might endanger the lives of the Communist members of the
                            supervisory teams, or might lead to an armed clash between U.S. and
                            South Korean forces. To illustrate his point, Admiral <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said he was aware of the
                            reasons for the concern expressed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but
                            pointed out that the State Department had insufficient notice that this
                            item was to be brought up for discussion at this meeting of the Council,
                            and was therefore not prepared to discuss it. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> confirmed Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>’s statement.</p>
                        <p>The President asked why the Swiss and the Swedes simply did not quit.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said they feared
                            to do so because of anticipated Communist pressures on their governments
                            if they did. The President then asked why we did not accord the same
                            treatment to these teams in South Korea which the Communists gave to the
                            teams in North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> suggested that this
                            issue might well be taken up in the first instance at the meeting
                            between the Joint Chiefs of Staff <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0046"
                            />and the State Department scheduled for Friday morning. It could then
                            be scheduled for consideration by the Council at its meeting next week.
                            The President suggested, however, that the State Department get together
                            with the Joint Chiefs as early as they could, and bring their
                            recommendations to him directly.<note n="5" xml:id="d11fn5"

                                Swiss and Swedes may next withdraw their representatives. Communists

                            <p><gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> main objection has never been

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that the raising
                            of the question of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> by Defense
                            at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting on February 3,
                            without prior consultation with the Department of State, had put the
                            Department on the spot. He did not exactly understand why the matter had
                            been so unexpectedly raised, particularly in the light of the fact that,
                            as the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was aware, the subject of
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> had been set up for discussion
                            at the State–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> meeting on February 4.
                            Because there had been no prior State–Defense consultation on the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> discussion, the Acting Secretary had
                            not been prepared at the Council meeting, and therefore was not in a
                            position to present the political aspects of the question.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that he
                            was convinced that it was the time to get down to work on the problem of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, and that it was sufficiently
                            serious to be brought to the attention of the President. He thought the
                            President should know about the differences of opinion between the two
                            Departments, and the importance which Defense attaches to the matter.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> recalled that at
                            a State–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> meeting in early December,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> had promised some
                            substantive action within a week.<note n="2" xml:id="d13fn2">Reference
                                to informal notes of the State–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                meeting of December 4 (the only such meeting between November 20 and
                                January 14) do not reflect any such commitment on the part of Mr.

                                State Department representative at the meeting. In fact, the tenor
                                of the discussion was that the operation, which the State Department
                                favored as essential under existing political considerations, would
                                take time. [Footnote in the source text. A memorandum on the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> rejoined that he was
                            not aware of having made any such commitment, and noted that you could
                            not order the Swiss and the Swedes around like a battalion. He pointed
                            out that what we hoped to avoid during December was any action which
                            would result in a debate on Korea in the General Assembly, and that we
                            had clearly stated that we preferred to postpone action until the
                            General Assembly had adjourned. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> emphasized that the operation in Korea was a
                            United Nations, and not a United States proceeding. We had pressed the
                            Swiss and the Swedes, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            recalled, to take on this responsibility under the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stressed that
                            there were two salient aspects of the question: (1) the security of
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> military personnel; and (2)
                            continued delay means increasing Communist build-up of military forces
                            to the relative disadvantage of our own side. Under the Armistice
                            agreement, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said,
                            we were unable to introduce improved matériel: all we can do is replace
                            period hardware already on the spot, and this was becoming increasingly
                            difficult because the matériel, particularly aircraft, which was in
                            Korea at the time of the <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0049"
                            />Armistice, had largely become obsolete. He said the question was: how
                            long can we go on with this increasing danger from a military point of
                            view?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> would have some comments to
                            make, and that following him Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                >Phleger</persName>, the Department’s Legal Adviser, would go into
                            certain legal considerations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the
                            Department appreciated fully that the situation was an unnatural one,
                            that there were repeated Communist violations to the agreement with
                            respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, and that the work
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in North Korea was being
                            completely vitiated by Communist action. But it was essential, he
                            continued, that we have the expressed concurrence of the 15 other
                            nations with which we were associated in this <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> operation in any interference with the terms of the
                            Armistice. He pointed out that we had been in continual communication
                            with the 15 on the matter, and that it was only after long weeks of
                            discussion with the British and the French that a tripartite

                                >Robertson</persName> said that we recommend that we call a meeting
                            of the 16 to tell them the situation and suggest: (1) that they accept
                            the proposal that the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> introduce into

                            for discussion during a period not exceeding about two weeks, the Swiss

                                >NNSC</gloss> be liquidated and the <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss> assume those functions of the Commission dealing with
                            the Armistice; (2) that the Swiss and the Swedes simultaneously be
                            informed of this action as well as our doubts concerning its success,
                            and that we ask the Swiss and the Swedes to tell us their practical
                            proposals for a substantial reduction in personnel of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>; (3) that if the Communists do not
                            agree to the liquidation of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>,
                            and if the Swiss and Swedish practical proposals for reduction in
                            personnel envisage a cutback to no more than two inspection teams (to be
                            stationed in the demilitarized zone for the purpose of spot inspections
                            where required), these proposals should then be introduced into the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>, while we simultaneously seek a
                            reasonable period to persuade the Swiss and the Swedes unilaterally to
                            withdraw from the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, or to reduce
                            their personnel to this level and station them in the demilitarized zone
                            if the Communists fail to agree; and (4) that if these steps fail, we
                            convene another meeting of the 16 to discuss further courses of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> interjected that the
                            State Department fully recognizes the military aspects of the problem,
                            but is aware also that it has <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0050"
                            />important political implications. All steps should be taken in
                            consultation with the 16, he said. It would be fool-hardy to take
                            military action without consulting the others.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> again emphasized
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> was seriously
                            concerned about the possibility of an incident occurring in South Korea
                            involving the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we were fully aware of
                            that. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> went on
                            that the other 15 powers do not have the same concern that we do. The
                            Admiral asked Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> if the
                            State Department did not recognize the seriousness of the situation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> again stressed that
                            the Department certainly does, to which Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that nevertheless the
                            matter had been dragging on for six months. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> concurred, but also pointed to
                            the fact that the armistice negotiations, in which the Department of
                            Defense had indicated keen interest, had gone on for a much longer time.
                            He said that we would want to explore fully any possible action in the
                            Security Council of the United Nations. Again Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> emphasized that both General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> and Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BEO1">Briggs</persName> were very concerned,
                            and well they might be since it is the U.S. which has the responsibility
                            for the United Nations command. Once again Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> made it quite clear that there
                            was no lack of awareness in the Department of the risks involved. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed to the
                            repeated efforts made by the Department to encourage early action by the
                            Swiss and the Swedes.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then called on Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> to go over certain
                            legal aspects of the situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said that the role of a
                            lawyer was to give legal advice. He asked Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> if what he wanted was to be
                            relieved of certain restrictions in the armistice agreement. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that was right.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> noted that the
                            armistice agreement in Korea was of a kind which seemed to be coming
                            more and more popular in international affairs (a general armistice
                            without a termination date, which was almost in the nature of a treaty
                            of peace) but he added that it was also a political document. It was a
                            contract, he continued, which, if broken by one side, brought into play
                            certain rights on the part of the other side. The other side could
                            either (1) terminate the agreement or (2) attempt to enforce the
                            provisions which have been violated. Specifically, if we unilaterally
                            terminated paragraphs 13(c) and 13(d) of the armistice agreement (those
                            prohibiting the introduction of reinforced personnel or weapons), the
                            other side could say that we had abrogated the agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> stressed that any
                            provision to delete certain articles in an agreement must follow the
                            same procedure as was followed when the articles were drawn up, and it
                            must be done in the context of the same authority.</p>
                        <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0051"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> inquired if Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> thought General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> did not have authority
                            to take the action the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> favored. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> replied that in
                            general the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commander did not have
                            such authority, though he did not want to be misunderstood: although
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> cannot terminate the agreement,
                            there is a certain area in which he has a certain latitude—for instance,
                            as to the specific logistic services offered to inspection teams, or as
                            to the speed with which inspection trips are complied with—areas in
                            which the armistice might in fact be affected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BRR1">Bowie</persName> asked Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> if his principal concern was
                            to avoid an incident. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said that was General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>’s principal concern. He said that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> wanted to bring
                            violations of the agreement with respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> to the attention of the <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss> as grounds for abrogating the articles in the Armistice
                            agreement pertaining to that Commission.</p>
                        <p>Again Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> noted that any
                            abrogation of the agreement could only be accomplished legally under the
                            authority which had given rise to the agreement in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that was why we
                            felt that a preliminary meeting with the 16 was necessary.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> asked if it was
                            correct that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> believed
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> had no
                            authority to withdraw the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams
                            from South Korea without permission of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said
                            yes.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then read General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>’s signal of January
                                31<note n="5" xml:id="d13fn5">Reference’ is to <gloss

                                    target="#d10fn3">footnote 3, Document 10</ref>.</note> outlining
                            his great concern over the problem. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> added that it was hard for anyone to understand
                            the feeling of concern on the part of a commander in the field who is
                            under such constant risk.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked the Admiral to
                            define the risk, and the Admiral did so by reading from General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>’s message. The Admiral
                            highlighted the threats previously made by President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, the fact that the situation was so
                            serious that the teams had to be moved by helicopter in order to avoid
                            having to have them proceed overland with the increasing chances of an
                            incident, etc. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> had
                            indicated, the Admiral said, that the risk was critical now and was
                            bound to increase as U.S. troops were withdrawn and progressive
                            responsibility were turned over to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that this
                            risk had always existed from the very beginning, and that without the
                            provisions for the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> we would have
                            had no armistice agreement at all.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> suggested that his
                            recommendations be approved and that we present a well documented case
                            to an early meeting of the 16.</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> reverted to what
                            had been told President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            during the latter’s visit to the U.S. some months ago,<note n="6"

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that we had
                            made every effort. Did the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> feel that
                            there had been any omission? If so, what were the omissions?</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he realized
                            that efforts had been made, but that there was extreme danger in the
                            situation: it was full of dynamite. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> patiently reiterated that the State Department
                            was well aware of the danger. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> said that he did not know how many messages
                            there had been from General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>
                            on this subject. That was why, he said, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had been asked to take the
                            matter up at an early meeting of the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                            >NSC</gloss>. It was felt that the President should be informed of the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that, of course,
                            the State Department was delighted to have the matter brought up in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>, but would have liked to have
                            had our representative informed that the matter was to have been
                            discussed. In that way, the President would have had a far better
                            understanding of the problem. Continuing, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that he does not recall
                            having said last December that we would have an answer within a week;
                            what he had said, as he recalled it, was that we hoped to have an answer
                            from the Swiss and the Swedes within a week on our proposal.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            might very well have been mistaken, but that he had understood
                            otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> reviewed the
                            recommendations specified by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, and asked the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> if they concurred in the proposal to take the matter up
                            with the 16 as indicated.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that such a
                            procedure would at least have the effect of letting the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> know that we were trying to do
                            something.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> interjected to
                            echo the view that it was a very dangerous situation. The plan which had
                            been presented to the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> would probably
                            not work. Discussions could go on and on. We were permitting ourselves
                            to be talked out of what we knew to be right. What we propose does not
                            correct the existing situation, or alleviate the danger.</p>
                        <p>Again Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that the
                            danger had been with us ever since the armistice had been signed. It was
                            not new. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> agreed,
                            but repeated that the danger was increasing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> asked point blank if
                            the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was prepared unilaterally to
                            abrogate the armistice. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1"
                                >Carney</persName> said that we were prepared <pb n="25"
                                xml:id="pg_25" facs="0053"/>to terminate the privileges allowed to
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said that it was a question of
                            looking at the balance of the advantages against the disadvantages in
                            the situation, and determining what the consequences of a course of
                            action are, and whether the effect of certain acts were worth the
                            consequences they involved. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> added that if the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> “partnership” were too onerous, perhaps it should be
                            terminated.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_CARB1">Carney</persName> inquired if it was
                            not agreed that <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> was responsible for
                            the security of his own forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> readily agreed. He had always had that basic and
                            abiding responsibility. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> noted that the <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> position at the time of the armistice was far better
                            than it is now: then we had 8 divisions in the area; now, the problem of
                            security was increasing. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName>’s precarious position was not fully appreciated.
                            There was a time element involved.</p>
                        <p>There was some discussion as to whether or not a military armistice was a
                            political matter. It was emphasized by the State representatives in
                            general that the political implications of the Korean armistice could
                            not be completely divorced from the purely military considerations.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> noted wryly that
                            he recalled very well from his experience in Korea just how much freedom
                            of action he had had as military commander. He suggested the possibility
                            of the U.S. Government authorizing <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>
                            to take the action recommended by General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> as an interim measure, and then informing the
                            16.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed to look at this
                            proposition, but emphasized that we have this partnership and that we
                            must respect it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> also suggested that at
                            the projected meeting of the 16, we have someone from <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> present.</p>
                        <p>Ensuing discussion revolved around the question of whether or not General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> had been informed of
                            the U.S. Government’s plan. It was not clear that he had.</p>
                        <p>Reverting to the plan, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>
                            speculated that he did not see how the 16 could object.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> said that the
                            question boils down to a definition of the concept of the responsibility
                            of <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said that General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> was there as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            commander. General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName>
                            agreed, but noted that the U.S. was the executive agent of the command.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphasized,
                            however, that nevertheless he was representing <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then turned to the
                            recommendation which had originally been made by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>. He asked the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> if the proposals were agreeable.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            thought we should draft a message to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> pointing out the situation and
                            asking him for his <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0054"/>comments, and
                            whether or not he is prepared to take the continuing risk that the
                            program involves. The Admiral repeated that he had given General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> the impression on his
                            recent trip that he could expect early action on the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> was entitled to a clear
                            picture.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_BEO1">Briggs</persName> had been constantly
                            informed of developments.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed that the matter
                            should be discussed with General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> and that it should also be taken up with the
                            16.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> suggested that we
                            ask the 16 if the interim measures contemplated by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> are agreeable, and preferable to
                            unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> inquired exactly
                            what would happen if <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> acted
                            unilaterally. Again Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>
                            pointed out that we have a contract, the armistice agreement, and that
                            while we might be able to take emergency action as a temporary
                            expedient, any substantive change in the contract would have to be
                            agreed upon first by all the parties associated with us in it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked if it were
                            absolutely necessary to comply with every request of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> investigating teams in South Korea to
                            proceed to this or that place. He asked what the other side was doing in
                            North Korea. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            read from General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>’s message
                            that during the entire armistice period, only one <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> mobile inspection team in North Korea
                            had been dispatched to an investigation point as requested.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> broke in to say
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> has the
                            authority to fit his treatment of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> to conform to treatment accorded it in North Korea.
                            (However, ensuing discussion did not bring out that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> had been instructed in this
                            sense.)</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then said that
                            his position was that General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> was entitled to a full presentation of the case. He
                            said that General <persName corresp="#p_RGMB1">Ridgway</persName> had
                            indicated that the Army was prepared to cooperate in the drafting of a

                                unilateral declaration if necessary, Department of Defense fully
                                supports your views; however, State says it is politically and
                                legally undesirable to take action you recommend at this time.
                                Armistice Agreement entered into under Unified Command instructions
                                after full consultation with 15 other <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                                    target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. While remedies are available for

                                Armistice contract, these remedies can be utilized only by following

                                negotiated and concluded. Ur recommendation therefore considered
                                unwise, and State and <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> considered

                            frequent consultation on this problem. We agree that the Communist
                            violations of the reinforcement provisions of the Korean Armistice
                            Agreement and their frustration of the activities of the <gloss

                        <p>However, there are serious political and legal difficulties involved in
                            adopting any course of action leading to unilateral abrogation of any of
                            the provisions of the Korean Armistice, particularly in the present
                            situation in the Far East. The Armistice was entered into by <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> under instructions from the
                            United States Government acting as agent for the United Nations. Our
                            Allies were consulted and their support sought and obtained throughout
                            the course of the Armistice negotiations. Despite the reluctance of the
                            Swiss and Swedes we strongly urged them to serve on the <gloss

                            emergency, any course of action we take with respect <pb n="30"
                                xml:id="pg_30" facs="0058"/>to the Armistice and in particular the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> must give careful
                            consideration to the views of those whose support we had enlisted.</p>
                        <p>Taking these factors into account, the Department of State has been
                            actively endeavoring to solve the problem of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Recently, we persuaded our sixteen
                            Allies to support an approach to the Swiss and Swedes suggesting that
                            these neutrals withdraw their personnel to the Demilitarized Zone thus
                            making it possible for us to remove the Czech and Polish members of the
                            Commission from the territory of the Republic of Korea. In response to
                            this approach the Swiss and Swedes in recent aide-mémoire asked the
                            Chinese Communists and ourselves to find a way to terminate the
                            activities of the Commission, and if this is impossible to reduce its
                            personnel substantially.</p>

                                        in the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> without a

                                        advised. The discussions proposed in <gloss target="#t_ref1"
                                            >Ref</gloss> A would presumably be based upon grounds

                                        agreement and, in the event such discussions produce no

                                        our lack of success in long, drawn out discussions or

                                    <item>Such prior decisions as we make to lmt discussions to a pd
                                        not to exceed about 2 wk would have no influence whatsoever
                                        on the Communists. The <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>
                                        is a 2-power body without chmn and placing a time lmt on
                                        discussions on any subj is depn upon either an agreement to
                                        that eff by both sides, or a flat refusal by one side to
                                        cont such discussion. If we announce at the outset that we
                                        intend to lmt discussions of this issue to a definite pd of
                                        time, the Communist tactic, with which we have had prev
                                        experience, may be to stall such discussions until immed
                                        prior to the expiration of such time lmt, then come forth
                                        with proposals which, if given consideration, would ext the

                                        our being made to appear insincere in this whole issue. If
                                        we do not announce a time lmt beforehand, yet have no
                                        definite course of action of our own, a time lmt will be
                                        meaningless. I believe that any introduction of this issue

                                        entirely or, as a less desirable but welcome alternative,

                                            >NNIT</gloss>s to the DZ. Therefore, despite my belief

                                        be taken only after full consultation with the 16 nations.
                                        Therefore, it would appear appropriate that, at the meeting

                                would attempt to force the withdrawal of all teams. Yielding to such

                            foreign exchange, expediting an implementation of the aid program, and
                            the initiation of a national austerity program in the interests of
                            reconstruction. Mr. <persName>Wood</persName> and the Ambassador see
                            this as a hopeful means of getting maximum <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                        <p>In accordance with your request, we have called a meeting of the 16. The
                            discussion at the last meeting of the 16 concluded with: (1) the
                            agreement of the 16 to consult with their Governments on the question of
                            paragraph 13d (the reinforcing restrictions of the Armistice Agreement)
                            and our agreement to take no action in this connection pending further
                            consultation with the 16; and (2) a discussion of the problem of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> at which time it was agreed
                            that it would be desirable to delay a reply to the Swiss and Swedes
                            until the substance of the Chinese Communist reply was known.</p>
                        <p>On paragraph 13d, we have worked together with Defense in an effort to
                            prepare a brief for unilateral action which would be convincing to our
                            Allies and to the public. This brief (now under revision) does make the
                            military case but, unfortunately, the case is not as effective as had
                            been expected. For your information, <gloss target="#t_Gndash21"
                                >G–2</gloss>, curiously enough, apparently had not been consulted on
                            this problem since in working up the brief it was apparent they doubted
                            the wisdom of the course of action the Joint Chiefs of Staff (<gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>) have urged. In addition, <gloss
                                target="#t_Gndash31">G–3</gloss> and Defense in connection with
                            preparation of the brief indicated there was no intention of introducing
                            new weapons or equipment into Korea in the near future, thus
                            undercutting somewhat the urgency of the matter. We have asked Defense,
                            therefore, to have a high-ranking military officer—perhaps Admiral

                                attend the meeting.</note>—to attend the meeting in order to make as
                            strong a military <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0067"/>case for action
                            on paragraph 13d as possible. I believe, however, that we should also
                            stress the political case for action. We should make clear to our Allies
                            the undesirability from a political standpoint of continuing
                            indefinitely to adhere to agreements or elements thereof which the
                            Communists violate with impunity. If we continue to adhere to elements
                            of the Armistice Agreement which the Communists have violated, we
                            thereby permit the Communists to perpetuate the myth that they are
                            complying with the reinforcement provisions of the Armistice. However,
                            because of the weakness of the case prepared by the military, and the
                            difficult problem of timing of any action, I believe we should make no
                            recommendations for immediate action in connection with paragraph 13d in
                            this meeting but should (a) let the military present their more detailed
                            case, (b) stress the political problem mentioned above, and (c) listen
                            to the views of our Allies.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, I suggest the
                            group be informed that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command has
                            again charged the Communists in the Military Armistice Commission with
                            violating paragraph 13d of the Armistice Agreement by introducing jet
                            aircraft after the Armistice was signed. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command on February 21, 1954, therefore, requested the

                            for an effective investigation, if any, the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command will have brought the record of Communist
                            obstruction and frustration of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>

                        <p>The Chinese Communists have now replied to the Swiss and Swedish
                            Aide-Mémoire. Their reply makes it clear that they will not agree to a
                            liquidation of the Commission because they insist the Commission is
                            working very well and is making a contribution to the peace. The
                            Communists have given lip service to the Swiss and Swedish proposal for
                            reduction in the number of personnel on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>, making it clear, however, that they would not agree
                            to the Commission’s being relieved of any of its control functions.
                            Furthermore, they have suggested that the question of reduction of
                            personnel on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> be considered by
                            the four nations with members on the Commission who would then decide
                            upon methods for reduction in personnel. This procedure could delay
                            indefinitely any decision to reduce the personnel of the Commission and
                            in all likelihood would not result in a reduction to the extent we
                            wish.</p>
                        <p>The Swiss are now pressing us for a reply to their Aide-Mémoire. We are
                            preparing such a reply and believe that before sending <pb n="40"

                                    clear that we have set an absolute limit to that position. If
                                    these negotiations fail, take the matter up in the Military
                                    Armistice Commission for a short time and follow this action
                                    with action to reduce the activities and personnel of the <gloss

                                    sought to negotiate. This course of action would almost
                                    certainly lead to a situation in which the <gloss

                                    position of demanding more drastic action than the Swiss and
                                    Swedes will have attempted to negotiate with the Czechs and

                        <p>We, therefore, prefer the first of these alternatives, because it avoids
                            a situation in which the public position of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"

                            rapidly. In any event, we want the agreement now of our Allies to action
                            by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command, if necessary, to

                                <p>“In fact, so-called Armistice has become a farce by chronic and
                                    downright Communist violations. It has become evident that
                                    Communists will continue abusing Armistice as shield for their
                                    unlawful but undeterred build-up of striking power until they
                                    grow strong enough to throw away even this farce of an Armistice
                                    for an all-out attack. Armistice has completely lost its raison
                                    d’etre not only because of continual Communist violations of it
                                    but also because it is no longer prelude to peaceful solution of
                                    Korean question which deliberate Communist intransigence has
                                    rendered time and again an utter failure until now free world is
                                    resigned to stark impossibility of unifying Korean nation
                                    through peaceful negotiation with Communists.</p>
                                <p>“There is no fighting not because Communist-disregarded Armistice
                                    deserves any regard from free world but simply because no side
                                    wishes to reopen hostilities for time being. This Government
                                    cannot understand if a certain arrangement other than abolition
                                    of <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> makes it possible for
                                    Communist members of commission to remain in South Korea and
                                    keep carrying on espionage activities. Any such arrangement will
                                    be signal for this Government to take appropriate action to
                                    safeguard national security. Such an unsatisfactory arrangement
                                    will put an end to patience with which this Government has been
                                    waiting for satisfactory result which concerted actions of our
                                    friendly allies were expected to have brought. To repeat, any
                                    decision of matter reached at long last will at least tell this
                                    Government that there is no more need for waiting. If decision
                                    is satisfactory to this Government, no action on its part would
                                    be needed. On other hand, if decision is unsatisfactory, an
                                    attempt on part of this Government to set it right will be
                                    naturally expected. This Government trusts that justice will be
                                    with it.”</p>

                        <p>In discussing failures it was pointed out to Governor most are related to
                            Pres <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s two major fixations on
                            pegged foreign exchange and psychopathic opposition to Japanese,
                            respectively. It was suggested that he will never be persuaded to
                            relinquish these fixations; that measure of success aid program has been
                            due to our success in persuading him to moderate his position on such
                            things as dollar auctions and realistic pricing; and that any future
                            success will depend on our ability to obtain continuation of moderate
                            attitude.</p>
                        <p>President opened each conference with half-hour recital his grievances
                            against <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> followed by extensive
                            remarks on relations with Japan and finally lengthy exposition his known
                            views on exchange rates. In each conference he offered advance Hwan for
                            UMC accepting repayment at any rate between 180 and 600 which <gloss
                                target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> considered fair. As part of plan he
                            would proclaim rate of 180 for all other transactions and asserted
                            Korean people would accept this rate as part their patriotic duty;
                            however, if after trial it was decided rate could not be held at 180 he
                            would raise it, mentioning in this connection’ such rates as 220, 300
                            and eventually 400. He insisted his plan would succeed on six months’
                            trial; he pointed out that he and other Koreans knew more about their
                            business than others (including ourselves); he would not auction off any
                            of Korea’s foreign exchange; that it was Korea’s sovereign right to peg
                            the rate at 180; and that if <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> actions

                            were not acceptable to U.S. and its Congress, U.S. would have to
                            withhold its aid or adjust itself to Korean policy in any way it found
                            it possible.</p>

                        <p>In replying at first conference, Governor on behalf U.S. thanked Korea
                            for firm stand against communism; sympathized on <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> issue and expressed opinion that in
                            this as in many other situations in world today best solution was
                            reached through exercise patience.</p>
                        <p>In taking up immediate problems connection aid program, Governor first
                            noted improvements effected through program in recent months and then
                            enumerated shortcomings in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            performance under minute of understanding essentially as outlined in
                            account of briefings given above. He then took up Paik Tu-chin’s letter
                            of March 2 saying letter contained unjustified charges against U.S. and
                            was not on whole kind of letter a government sends to another friendly
                            govt. After some discussion various points Governor raised, conference
                            adjourned about 3:30 pm to resume next morning at ten.</p>
                        <p>Main features second conference were President’s acrimonious remarks on
                            exchange rate and discussion Paik’s letter. Governor let [<hi

                            auctions. He said U.S. also hoped eventually stabilize Hwan but pointed
                            out this stabilizing process in Greece required four years after
                            fighting ceased and in Japan, three and half. He noted the admitted
                            improvement Korea’s last few months and asked for continuation dollar
                            auction system through June 30 with offerings by <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                        <p>The President interrupted Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s briefing with a comment that he would very much

                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> report to the
                            National Security Council on the relative military situation of the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command in Korea and the
                            Communists in the north, when General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> returned to the United States. The President
                            added that in view of the dangers posed for the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command by the constant Communist violations of the
                            armistice agreement, and in view of the difficulties involving the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, he regretfully believed that the
                            United States would have to start violating the armistice itself.</p>
                        <p>After Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> had completed his
                            briefing of the Council with a reference to the acute difficulties
                            encountered in the effort to prepare a Financial Appendix, he called on
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> explained that he
                            was quite certain that unless there were major changes in the military
                            situation in Korea and the Communists withdrew large forces, it would be
                            absolutely impossible to get the Government of the Republic of Korea
                            willingly to agree to reduce the current level of South Korean military
                            forces. Accordingly, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> predicted that we would have to continue to
                            support the existing level of South Korean forces for at least another
                            year.</p>
                        <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0085"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then asked the Secretary
                            of State if he would not comment on the problem posed by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> indicated that the State
                            Department had found it very hard to get the Swiss and Swedish
                            Governments to do anything at all to remedy this situation lest in so
                            doing they give offense to the Soviet Union. Accordingly, the most the
                            United States could hope to do for the time being was to reduce the size
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> at once to a skeleton or
                            nominal basis. The Communists, of course, did not want any change in the
                            existing set-up, because it was a one-way street for them. They entirely
                            restricted the operation of the teams in North Korea, while enjoying
                            advantages from the relatively unrestricted operation of the teams in
                            South Korea. All in all, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, this was a “scandalous” operation, which the
                            State Department had been doing its best to liquidate and to do so in
                            such a way as to avoid resort by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> to liquidation by unilateral action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> said he wished to
                            inquire as to the intent of paragraph 4 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5514, which called on the United States widely to
                            publicize the fact that the Communists had violated the provisions of
                            the armistice agreement since its inception. Did this, inquired Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, call for an official
                            statement by the United States Government? After all, the same problem
                            existed in the violations by the Vietminh in Indochina. It constituted a
                            very delicate problem [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] and if any such official statement were to be
                            issued, it would have to be prepared with the utmost care.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> that the
                            material which we could put into an official U.S. statement would almost
                            certainly exclude much of what we are reasonably sure constitutes
                            evidence of the grossest kind of Communist violations.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            at the last meeting of the representatives of the sixteen countries who
                            had participated on our side in the Korean war, it had been agreed that
                            the United States should prepare such a public statement, and, indeed,
                            such a statement was in the course of being prepared. However, the
                            statement would not include material derived from sensitive intelligence
                            sources, but would depend instead on information from overt sources.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that he had
                            not understood that paragraph 4 referred solely to an official U.S.
                            Government statement. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that such a statement was necessary in
                            the view of the representatives of the sixteen nations, since it was
                            essential for them to be able to publicize the Communist violations in
                            order to inform public opinion in their respective countries. The
                            President indicated that if he were to write a private letter to the
                            British Prime Minister, it would be perfectly possible to include
                            information about Communist violations, no matter how sensitive the
                            source of information. Furthermore, he believed that such a letter would
                            be very <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0086"/>useful and influential.
                            In this connection, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> made reference to the contents of a communication
                            from the British Chargé in Peiping to the Foreign Office in London,
                            describing a conversation between Trevelyan and Chou En-lai regarding
                            the atrocities which the Chinese Communists had perpetrated on British
                            prisoners captured in the Korean war.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then said he
                            wished to comment on paragraph 10–d, of <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> 5514, which called for an effort to persuade other
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members to maintain at least
                            minimum armed forces in the Republic of Korea in order to preserve the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command. While, said Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, he did not object to
                            the inclusion of this course of action in the paper, the members of the
                            National Security Council should be clearly aware of the increasing
                            difficulty the U.S. would encounter in carrying out this course of
                            action. Sir Anthony Eden had been pressing him at the recent Bangkok
                            Conference to get the remaining British forces transferred from Korea to
                            Malaya, in order to meet pressing problems in the latter area.<note

                                    >Dulles</persName> later discussed his conversation with Eden in

                                    >Robertson</persName> on March 23. As <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> remembered it, nothing had
                                been decided concerning the British desire to withdraw troops
                                stationed in Korea. The British wanted troops for the fighting in
                                Malaya and the United States wanted the Commonwealth nations to keep
                                a division in Korea. (Eisenhower Library, Dulles Papers, General
                                Telephone Conversations)</note> Aware of their own increased
                            commitments for the defense of Southeast Asia, the Australians and the
                            New Zealanders were taking the same position. The Philippines also want
                            out. Perhaps the best case of all could be made by the Thailanders, who
                            obviously needed their forces in Korea to protect the home territory.
                            Accordingly, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            said he was far from optimistic as to the probable success of this
                            proposal.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> expressed
                            agreement with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            as to the likelihood of mounting difficulties in retaining these other
                            contingents in Korea. Except for the Turks, however, the other
                            contingents in South Korea didn’t amount to very much from a military
                            point of view. What he found irritating, continued Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, was that the very countries
                            which have withdrawn their forces or are contemplating their withdrawal,
                            should continue to throw their weight around on such problems as that
                            posed by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> for the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command. Indeed, he was inclined to
                            question whether any nations which withdrew their forces from Korea
                            should properly continue to form a part of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command. As things now were, these countries were able

                            U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff in the reduction of Commonwealth forces in
                            Korea to one battalion group, commencing about 1 April 1955.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d31fn2">The Commonwealth request was made in a memorandum
                                from the representatives of the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand,
                                and British Chiefs of Staff to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"

                                memorandum to the Secretary of Defense on March 25 in which they
                                recommended that Department of State concurrence be obtained for a

                        <p>It is understood that when this problem was discussed initially with the
                            Department of State, the reduction in question was considered as
                            applying only to the Australian forces. However, it is apparent from the
                            request of the Representatives of the Commonwealth Chiefs of Staff that
                            they consider this reduction as applying to other Commonwealth forces.
                            Further, the Canadians have specifically indicated a desire to withdraw
                            their forces from Korea in the immediate future. Inasmuch as the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff have reported that Department of State discussions with
                            Commonwealth Representatives on this matter during the Manila Pact
                            Conference at Bangkok in February appear to be susceptible to broad
                                interpretation,<note n="3" xml:id="d31fn3">See <ref target="#d30fn7"

                            needs clarification.</p>
                        <p>The Department of Defense considers that the withdrawal of additional
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces from Korea, though now
                            under study by the Joint Chiefs of Staff with a view to re-evaluating
                            the requirements of the situation, could not be accomplished at this
                            time without risk of seriously jeopardizing what has been accomplished
                            in Korea to date. This consideration is based upon the fact that U.S.
                            ground forces in Korea have been reduced from three Corps with an
                            approximate total of 300,000, to one Corps with an approximate total of
                            90,000 personnel; and the fact that <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            forces other than U.S. have been reduced from an approximate total of
                            33,000, to a current approximate total of 14,000 personnel. Certain of
                            the Commonwealth forces including elements of the Canadian and
                            Australian contingents have already been withdrawn which accounts
                            largely for this <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> reduction. The United
                            Nations’ character of the forces in Korea has thus been greatly reduced
                            with a resultant lowering of the combat effectiveness of the forces
                            opposing the Communists.</p>
                        <p>I concur fully in the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> recommendation
                            regarding the necessity for maintaining adequate <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces representation in Korea, as indicated in the

                            1955. However, I will defer to the judgement of the Department of State
                            regarding the proposed withdrawal of Commonwealth forces from Korea. If
                            on the other hand the Department of State does not concur in the
                            proposed withdrawal, this Department requests your concurrence <pb

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Walter</persName></hi>: Ty Wood’s
                            office has recently sent to Washington a carefully prepared presentation
                            of what it is hoped to accomplish under the aid program for Korea in

                                found in Department of State files.</note> The document was drafted
                            in connection with <gloss target="#t_FOA1">FOA</gloss>’s submission of
                            data and estimates to Congress. Copies should be in Washington this
                            week.</p>
                        <p>One aspect of this matter gives me some preoccupation. That is the lack
                            of wholehearted collaboration on the part of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, particularly with respect to the
                            economic side of the program. Instead of helping row the boat, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> persists in throwing out anchors.
                            Instead of collaborating in strengthening the dike, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> keeps boring holes in it, so that
                            Ty Wood has to engage in a series of emergency plumbing operations at
                            the expense of progress with the main construction. From my telegrams
                            and despatches this situation will of course be familiar to you, and in
                            this connection I refer to Despatch No. 213 of March 16, 1955,<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d33fn3">Despatch 213 from Seoul, March 16, transmitted
                                a draft of a letter prepared by Henry Costanzo, Treasury
                                Representative in the Office of the Economic Coordinator, in reply
                                to the March 2 letter from Paik Tu-chin to <persName>Wood</persName>
                                (see <ref target="#d28">Document 28</ref>). The Embassy noted that,
                                in view of the withdrawal of Paik’s letter by the South Korean
                                Government, Costanzo’s letter was not delivered to Paik. (Department

                            on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Performance Under the Minute of
                            Understanding”.</p>
                        <p>In my judgment, unless we can obtain more effective collaboration from
                            the <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Government and greater
                            compliance with the commitments contained in the Minute of Understanding
                            of November 17, 1954, our program is likely to founder, regardless of
                            the <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0091"/>amount of American aid which
                            Congress may vote for the economic rehabilitation of Korea. I refer to
                            such specific problems as pricing aid goods into the economy, ensuring
                            realistic exchange rates, and permitting <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> dollars to be used to purchase freely in Japan as
                            elsewhere. In various other areas, such as encouraging private
                            enterprise and creating conditions favorable to the entry of American
                            capital, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> performance since the
                            Agreed Minute was signed has been almost imperceptible.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, if I were called upon to comment on the situation at a
                            Congressional hearing in Executive Session, I would have to call
                            attention to the lack of cooperation from the Republic of Korea in the
                            economic field, and perhaps suggest the need for some Congressionally
                            encouraged sanctions to obtain future <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> collaboration, including wise and timely use of Korea’s
                            own resources. Otherwise, would it not be well to cease the bickering
                            which has so delayed our program and weakened confidence in it locally,
                            resign ourselves to less ambitious economic goals, and so inform the
                            Congress?</p>
                        <p>I am not, of course, suggesting that I participate in the presentation of
                            Korean aid to Congress. On the contrary, with a new Ambassador shortly
                            taking over,<note n="4" xml:id="d33fn4"><persName corresp="#p_LWSB1"

                            might be better that my association with the problem end with my
                            departure from Korea. Nevertheless, because of our difficulties with the
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> Government over economic
                            aid and my belief that unless those difficulties are resolved our
                            program may fail to measure up to our own hopes and expectations, I felt
                            you would be interested in having these observations filed in the
                            twilight of 30 months of service in this battered and valiant country. I
                            have genuine affection for Korea and for the Korean people, but I
                            recognize it as a fact that some of the policies followed by President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> have not been conducive
                            to the success of the efforts of our Government to rebuild Korea, and
                            that if persisted in they will at the least seriously handicap our
                            future efforts.</p>

                        <p>Count Douglas called at his request to advise us of the new instructions
                            being sent to the Swedish <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            representative in Korea to propose that all fixed inspection teams be
                            abolished and that total personnel be reduced to between 10 and 20 per
                            country, all stationed in the demilitarized zone. His report followed
                            closely the information contained in Stockholm’s 878 of April 6.<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d34fn2">Not printed. (<hi rend="italic">Ibid.,</hi>

                        <p>We expressed the Department’s appreciation for this constructive and
                            forward step, particularly in the face of the different and timid
                            position presently adopted by the Swiss Government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MADII1">Douglas</persName> felt that his Government’s
                            decision reflected a firm determination to withdraw from the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> within a reasonable period and
                            suggested that after the expected failure of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and the <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss> to agree to the Swedish proposals, the Swedish
                            Government would probably advise both sides that it could no longer
                            continue and request that some other country be designated to replace
                            it. He thought that thereafter Sweden would remain on the Commission for
                            a short period to permit undoubtedly fruitless efforts to be made to
                            obtain a substitute. At that point they would withdraw.</p>
                        <p>Although Count Douglas said his Government thought the Swiss position is
                            perhaps undergoing some moderation, we expressed some concern that the
                            Swiss, while avoiding a vote in the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> against the Swedish proposal, might seek to prevent a
                            vote on the substance of the proposal on some procedural grounds.</p>
                        <p>Count Douglas stated that a copy of the instructions had also been sent
                            to the Swedish representative at the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>,
                            Mr. <persName>Thorsing</persName>, who would be advising
                            Hammarskjold.</p>
                        <p>We agreed that it is in our common interest to keep this information
                            strictly confidential.</p>

                                    response to the Swiss note delivered on March 25 (see <ref
                                        target="#d32">Document 32</ref>). In the note, the United
                                    States sympathized with the difficult situation faced by
                                    Switzerland with respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                        >NNSC</gloss> but concluded that the Swiss proposal of March
                                    25 left unsolved “the serious problem created by the presence of
                                    any Communist members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory
                                    Commission in South Korea.” After a review of the nature of the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> handed the note to the
                            Swiss Minister stating that there had been no change in the United
                            States position with respect to the Neutral Nations Supervisory
                            Commission (<gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>). Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that we had included
                            in the note a reference to the Swedish proposal that inspection teams at
                            the ports of entry be abolished; that total personnel be reduced to
                            between ten and twenty persons per country; and that all remaining
                            personnel be stationed in the Demilitarized Zone. He hoped that the
                            Swiss would find it possible to support the Swedish proposal.</p>
                        <p>Minister de Torrente then suggested that in view of his understanding
                            that the principal problem with respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> was a result of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            hostilities toward the Czechs and Poles on that Commission, an
                            alternative solution might be to establish headquarters for the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> at Panmunjom and to assign Swiss and
                            Swedes as liaison officers with the United Nations Command, presumably
                            to be stationed in the ports of entry in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>. Similarly Czechs and Poles could be established as
                            liaison officers in north Korea. The Minister emphasized that he had no
                            instructions on this matter and was speaking quite unofficially and in
                            response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s question
                            said he thought his government would prefer a solution such as he had
                            suggested rather than the Swedish solution because it would seem to them
                            to be more legal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            responded that he found it very difficult to understand this position
                            and that while the Minister’s idea would of course be some improvement
                            over the <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0094"/>present state of
                            affairs, viewing the measure as a whole the United States Government
                            much preferred the proposal made by Sweden.</p>

                            prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff on March 25 and have proposed a
                            reply through military channels opposing a reduction at this time and
                            asking the Commonwealth countries to reconsider.</p>
                        <p>I fully share your concern over the continuing reduction in the
                            contributions of our Allies to the United Nations Command in Korea, and
                            the Department of State has made every effort to persuade other
                            countries to keep contingents in Korea. While I doubt that we can do
                            more than forestall the proposed reduction in Commonwealth forces for
                            the immediate future—and perhaps will be unsuccessful even in this
                            effort—I agree with you that we should transmit a note to the
                            Commonwealth opposing further reduction at this time.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d36fn4">See <ref target="#d39">Document 39</ref>.</note></p>
                        <p>Since I believe that the motivation behind the position of the
                            Commonwealth countries is primarily political, I suggest that the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff note be expanded somewhat to point up the psychological
                            and political effects of such a withdrawal at this time. I have in mind
                            the effect it will have on the Free World position in Asia, the
                            increased difficulty in persuading the Republic of Korea that the issue

                            possible reaction of the American public toward the Commonwealth which
                            will be interpreted as wanting a voice in northeast Asia without
                            accepting commensurate responsibilities. In view of our action on the

                                orally asked the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> for concurrence

                                The Canadian Embassy supported this request on March 28 in view of
                                the adverse political repercussions which they felt would follow in
                                Canada if Canadians were not permitted to leave Korea at the end of
                                their normal tours of duty. (Telegram 280 to Ottawa, March 29;
                                Department of State, Central Files, 795B.5/3–2955) On March 31, the
                                Department informed the Canadian Embassy that, pending a review of
                                U.N. strength in Korea and a corresponding review of the
                                Commonwealth proposal, the United States was not in a position to
                                concur in the withdrawal of the Canadian battalion from Korea. If,
                                however, the Canadian Government still wished to proceed with the
                                withdrawal, the United States would make the necessary transport

                            political and military reasons. In working this matter out it may prove

                        <p>Bill Lacy spoke to me concerning the Korean situation, and reported a
                            highly personal and confidential talk he had had with <persName

                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> be protected on this.</p>
                        <p>He said that he had bluntly asked <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> what the build-up plans in Korea were, and
                            received the answer that they were “to restore the balance between
                            ourselves and the Communists, by the replacement of old and obsolete
                            equipment with new”. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            made it clear that what he had in mind was primarily airplanes, but also
                                <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0096"/>including some small
                            equipment such as mortars. There was a bare possibility that such

                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> made it clear that our defense
                            in depth was now far back of Korea and even back of Japan to Okinawa.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> commented that it was
                            clear that the “restoration of balance” to which <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> referred was in no sense a
                            local balance in Korea, but, if anything, a balance in the whole
                            area.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> made the following points: <list>

                                <item>He felt that this information was different than that on which
                                    the Secretary was basing his plans and proceeding, and that the
                                    Secretary should be informed.</item>

                                    abolishment of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and of
                                    Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement. He said that, even
                                    under these conditions, he still felt it was advisable to get
                                    rid of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, because of its
                                    internal Korean implications. However, he felt that we
                                    definitely should not go through the agony of negotiating with
                                    our allies to abolish Article 13(d) when our plans (as outlined
                                    above) do not envision anything which cannot be accomplished
                                    under 13(d).</item>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> indicated that he
                            would first discuss briefly the military situation in the Far East
                            generally, and would follow this with a description of the specific
                            military situation in Korea occasioned by the armistice and the
                            activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (<gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>). Using a map indicating military
                            dispositions and a chart indicating the strength of Communist and
                            friendly forces in the Far East, General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> proceeded to make his presentation.</p>
                        <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0097"/>
                        <p>He dealt first with the opposing forces in the Far East—Soviet, Chinese
                            Communist, and North Korean—by Services. He noted a considerable
                            reduction in total Communist forces in North Korea since the armistice.
                            He estimated that the present total of such forces was in the
                            neighborhood of 780,000, and indications pointed to a defensive rather
                            than an offensive role for these forces at the present time.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> then commented on
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces in South Korea. He listed the total of friendly
                            forces in South Korea at 730,000. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> spoke with pride of the development and
                            capabilities of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. The
                            chief difficulties were that the highest ranking officers in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed services were very young and
                            lacked experience in the handling of large forces in the field,
                            especially from the administrative point of view.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> then discussed
                            Japanese military capabilities, which he said he could not rate very
                            high. He described this as our greatest military problem in the Far East
                            at the present time. It was essential to build up Japan’s armed forces.
                            While progress was discernible, it was very slow.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> then analyzed
                            current U.S. strength in the Korean area and in the Far East generally.
                            He described U.S. strength as being approximately at the present time
                            what it was in June 1950, prior to the outbreak of the Korean war.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> expressed the
                            belief that the remaining two U.S. divisions in Korea should be
                            redeployed to Japan, leaving only token U.S. forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> then turned to the
                            specific problem occasioned by persistent Communist violations of the
                            armistice. He noted paragraph 13–d of the armistice agreement, which
                            forbade the replacement of old war matériel by new matériel, and
                            indicated that the Soviets constantly violated this provision by
                            avoiding ports of entry where they could be supervised. He said that the
                            United States was dealing with an enemy with a completely different code
                            of ethics than our own. The Communists approved any means which led to
                            the ends they sought. On the contrary, the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command had lived up to the armistice faithfully and
                            conscientiously. Accordingly, the longer the armistice continued and
                            paragraph 13–d was in effect, the worse off the U.S. would be. This
                            affected all three of the Services, and General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> cited illustrations of the
                            effects.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the personnel on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> inspection teams, General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> said that the Swiss and the Swedes were truly
                            neutral, while the Poles and the Czechs were completely pro-Communist.
                            Indeed, in private conversations with him General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> said that the Swiss and Swedish
                            members of these teams invariably described the inspection procedure as
                            a farce. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> then
                            indicated serious doubt whether President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> could be induced to agree to any <pb n="70"
                                xml:id="pg_70" facs="0098"/>future inspections by <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams in South Korea. We must not
                            only anticipate such refusals, but we must even anticipate the
                            possibility of an incident resulting from a South Korean move to seize
                            and imprison the Communist members of an inspection team. U.S. forces in
                            Korea were not now sufficiently numerous to prevent such an incident,
                            which would, of course, be very embarrassing. Accordingly, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> reiterated his earlier
                            recommendation that this Government take action at once to put an end to
                            the activities of these inspection teams. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> said that he was confident that
                            the Communists would not reopen hostilities if we abrogated this portion
                            of the armistice agreement. He believed that the Communists would reopen
                            the Korean war if and when it suited their plans.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired of General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> how he proposed to put an end to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> inspections. Would you, he asked,
                            merely inform the heads of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            that they would no longer be allowed to carry out inspections in South
                            Korea? General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> replied in
                            the affirmative if no agreement with the Swiss and Swedish Governments
                            was reached to end the operations of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. In short, said General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName>, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander
                            should unilaterally abolish the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> indicated his
                            opinion that the Swiss and the Swedes would be delighted at such
                            unilateral U.S. action, because they do not wish to be put in the
                            position of voluntarily withdrawing. In any case, said General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>, there were really two possible
                            solutions: First, to abolish the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            completely; second, to reduce their numbers drastically and to put an
                            end to further inspections, confining the remaining <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> personnel within the demilitarized
                            zone.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> further emphasized
                            how essential it was to change paragraph 13–d of the armistice agreement
                            in order that new and modern equipment could be supplied to <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces in South Korea. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> felt that the United States was “too big” to stoop
                            to imitate the Communist technique of violating the armistice agreement
                            by secretly introducing modern matériel.</p>
                        <p>The Vice President referred to General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName>’s expression of disappointment as to progress being
                            made in Japan’s rearmament, and asked General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> if he would elaborate a little.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> replied that his
                            degree of disappointment was relative. He explained Japan’s
                            difficulties, both psychological and practical, since her defeat at the
                            end of the war. He indicated that there was no disagreement among
                            Japanese leaders that the nation must rearm. The arguments were
                            occasioned on the matter of the rate of rearmament. This was coming
                            along, though not as rapidly as we would like.</p>
                        <p>The President then went back to General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName>’s statement that the picture of U.S. forces in the
                            Far East was not very different from what it had been in June 1950. On
                            the other hand, said the President <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0099"
                            />General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> had high praise
                            for the quality of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, and
                            had additionally indicated good capabilities for the Chinese forces on
                            Formosa and the developing strength of Japan’s forces. All in all, said
                            the President, he would therefore conclude that the total picture was
                            actually much brighter than it had been in June 1950. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> replied that the President’s
                            point was well taken, and that he had not meant to deny that our general
                            position in the Far East was much stronger than it had been in the
                            spring of 1950. The President then expressed agreement with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName>’s statement that the
                            United States must keep token forces in South Korea—perhaps in a
                            composite division.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> inquired of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1">Hull</persName> whether, if we did
                            away with the the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> inspection
                            teams, this wouldn’t mean that each side would be left free to build up
                            its own forces as it liked. General <persName corresp="#p_HGJE1"
                                >Hull</persName> said yes, but both he and the President pointed out
                            that the Communists were already doing precisely this. On the other
                            hand, said the President, in the event the inspection teams were
                            removed, at least the Air Force would not be obliged, as it now is, to
                            keep up maintenance facilities for obsolete aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then commented
                            that if the abrogation of paragraph 13–d of the armistice agreement
                            would greatly improve the U.S. military position, what possible
                            objection was there to proceeding? The President replied that there was
                            no objection, except, of course, that the State Department had entered
                            into the armistice agreement in good faith, and this would cause them
                            certain difficulties.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> indicated that
                            the State Department had been putting all possible pressure on the Swiss
                            and the Swedes to get them out of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. The most recent meeting on the subject had been held
                            on April 20, but he had no report as to the results. The President
                            commented that one would think that self-respect alone would compel the
                            Swiss and the Swedes to get out of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. After further discussion, the President added that
                            the United States had got to move in on a situation which was really
                            becoming intolerable.</p>

                                <p>“The proposal of the Commonwealth countries to reduce their
                                    forces in Korea at this time, and the probable effect such an
                                    action would have on the decision of other participating
                                    countries, is a matter of concern to the Government of the
                                    United States. In the face of the current tension in the Far
                                    East, this Government believes that further reductions in the
                                    size of the United Nations Command would have serious adverse
                                    impact militarily and politically on the interests of the Free
                                    World in Asia. If the Commonwealth forces are further reduced,
                                    less powerful and less concerned nations will find it difficult
                                    to continue their contributions. Should such reductions
                                    continue, the international composition of the United Nations
                                    Command would be jeopardized and a point would soon be reached
                                    at which the continued existence of the United Nations Command
                                    would be in question. It is the view of the Government of the
                                    United States that the continued existence of the United Nations
                                    Command is important to the maintenance of the Armistice and to
                                    stability in the area of Korea by reason of its deterrent effect
                                    upon the Communists and the assurance it affords of united
                                    policies on the part of the Free World nations toward the Korean
                                    problem.”</p>
                                <p>The note concludes with an expression of hope “that the
                                    Commonwealth Governments will be disposed to reconsider their
                                    proposal and to defer additional withdrawals of their
                                    forces.”</p></note> As earlier requested by the Australians,
                            their note was given to Mr. <persName>McCardle</persName> to deliver to
                            them.</p>

                        <p>In response to a question, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1"
                                >Hemmendinger</persName> told the group that while the United States
                            Joint Chiefs might also reply, their reply would be only a formality and
                            would refer to the notes just handed out. Furthermore, it was pointed
                            out that since the word “concur”, which appeared in the communication of
                            the Chiefs of Staff of the Commonwealth countries, was regarded as
                            unfortunate by some, the use of this word had been carefully avoided
                            wherever possible throughout the note. Attention was then called to the
                            fact that the word “concur” appeared only once—in the first
                            paragraph—but that this was in describing the joint note from the
                            Commonwealth Chiefs of Staff. Mr. <persName>McCardle</persName>, whose
                            country had felt the note to be a derogation of its sovereignty, said he
                            found no objection to the word “concur” as used in the United States
                            note and thought it perfectly proper in this context. The other members
                            of the group also agreed.</p>
                        <p>The group felt the note to be very clear and the only point which was
                            elucidated for them was the difficult situation which would be created
                            with respect to maintaining forces in Korea from other countries with
                            less concern in the Far East, and with less capacity to support forces,
                            if the Commonwealth countries were to reduce their forces further.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>McCardle</persName> stated that the Foreign Minister
                            planned to make a statement on May 2 in which—among other things—he
                            would announce that in view of discussions looking forward to a further
                            reduction of United Nations contingents in Korea the Canadian Government
                            did not intend to replace its battalion in Korea but would retain there
                            for the time being, a destroyer and an ambulance unit. He was not able
                            to predict what effect the United States note might have on the planned
                            statement.</p>

                            <p>For the purposes of the instructions under reference the Republic of
                                Korea (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) is considered to be the
                                type of country in which the primary need for U.S. assistance is in
                                improving the capabilities of police-type forces in order to prevent
                                Communist subversion from making important headway. Greater U.S.
                                efforts, therefore, should be <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0103"
                                />directed towards improving the overall effectiveness of existing
                                internal security forces. The National Police is the logical
                                organization for development as the major internal security force
                                because of its manpower, its long existence as a police force and
                                its complete coverage of the country. From a manpower standpoint it
                                is adequate, but on the basis of actual performance it does not even
                                approximate an adequate counter-espionage and counter-intelligence
                                service. Korea suffers from a plethora of internal security
                                organizations which are not only countenanced but encouraged and
                                utilized by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>.
                                The two major forces, in addition to the National Police, are the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army <gloss target="#t_CIC1"
                                    >CIC</gloss> and the Joint Provost Marshal Command. All these
                                organizations are used at times by President <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> for security as well as
                                political actions, and, in addition, the President has his own
                                private police and investigating force known as the Kyungmudae<note

                                from the National Police personnel. Such a diversity of security and
                                investigative units results in vying for the favor of President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, and generally each
                                unit spends more time watching the others for indications of
                                Presidential favor than in doing the spade work necessary to uncover
                                skillful subversive tactics. Within the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss>, the regular armed forces should continue to have

                                there are at present relatively few manifestations of internal
                                Communist activity in South Korea. A potentially dangerous situation
                                could develop, however, in the event President <persName

                                His personal rule, his failure to provide for a successor, his
                                policy of playing off officials against each other, and the absence
                                of strongly entrenched traditions of political party
                                responsibilities are some of the characteristics which could provide
                                confusion and disorder when the firm hand of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is removed. Such a situation
                                would be fertile ground for Communist subversive activities.</p>

                            <p>In these circumstances certain limited North Korean subversive assets
                                which already exist in South Korea in a more or less dormant state
                                could be used to advantage by trained agents to exploit the
                                confusion and disorder that might well accompany a <gloss

                                identifiable groups are assets of this type: Remnants of the former
                                Communist underground in South Korea; other Communists and Communist
                                sympathizers who survived the Korean war in the <gloss

                                the war; approximately two million refugees from North Korea now in
                                South Korea who, although mostly non-Communists, are exploitable
                                because of their friends and relatives in North Korea; and prisoners

                                Korea.</p>
                            <p>The counter-subversive facilities and personnel of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security agencies are almost fully
                                occupied in carrying out political tasks assigned by President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and in seeking to
                                combat the large volume of Communist low-level espionage and
                                subversive penetration attempts from North Korea. Even so,
                                subversives apprehended by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                probably represent only a fraction of the total number of agents
                                dispatched by the <gloss target="#t_KLP1">KLP</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>It can be assumed that there are high caliber individual agents
                                working at high levels within the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> whose mission is political subversion. Civil and
                                military security agents do not have a planned, coordinated program
                                to combat this type agent who represents a far greater threat of
                                political subversion than do the low-level type, border crossing
                                agents.</p>
                            <p>A dangerous situation results from the fact that through its control
                                of coastal smuggling channels between North and South Korea the
                                    <gloss target="#t_KLP1">KLP</gloss> and its intelligence
                                organization exert a damaging influence on the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> intelligence efforts. Fifteen
                                Communist front trading organizations have been established in North
                                Korea close to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> positive and counter-intelligence
                                agencies in turn have established cover-type commercial firms in
                                South Korea to deal with these North Korean organizations on the
                                naive assumption that the South Koreans will be able to engage in
                                effective positive intelligence activities against the North. In
                                practice the <gloss target="#t_KLP1">KLP</gloss> is able to send
                                commercial goods, subversive agents, funds, instructions and radios
                                through the smuggling channel to the South Korean commercial fronts
                                and through them to other destinations in South Korea. However, the
                                agents and couriers dispatched by the South Korean intelligence
                                services are not permitted to penetrate North Korea beyond the
                                trading firms immediately above the DMZ where they receive
                                information which is prepared and intended for them by the <gloss

                            <p>The inadequate salaries of members of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> police and military counter-subversive agencies
                                make them susceptible to bribes to augment their salaries. This
                                situation is no doubt exploited by the North Koreans, and as a
                                result some criminals and subversives without proper identification
                                documents can probably evade the law and go undetected.</p>
                            <p>There are two organizations in Japan, the Minsen (Korean Minority
                                Group of the Japanese Communist Party (<gloss target="#t_JCP1"
                                    >JCP</gloss>)) and the Third Force movement for Korean

                                potential usefulness in South Korea for Communist purposes.
                                Indicative of Minsen activity is the fact one such political-type
                                agent has been detected and apprehended in Korea in the last five
                                months. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has outlawed the
                                Third Force movement and fought it. The Communists both in North
                                Korea and in Japan engage in extensive smuggling by sea between
                                Japan and South Korea. Profits help finance their operations and the

                            position that the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> be reduced to
                            only 10 or 20 representatives from each of the four contributing

                            this proposition within a reasonable time, the Swedes would make a

                                795.00/5–355)</note> indicates that the Swedes have settled for
                            substantially less than they set out to achieve and have agreed with
                            other members of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> to recommend
                            to the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> elimination of two inspection
                            teams in each of the two zones in Korea and a reduction of personnel on

                            representatives from only one of the neutrals appointed by each side.
                            This position still leaves Polish and or Czechs on Republic of Korea

                                not been supported by the Swiss Delegation, and had been forced to

                                satisfactory agreement possible at the time. Boheman added that the

                                    >NNSC</gloss> that Sweden could only accept the proposed

                                    >MAC</gloss> since it was evident that the proposed reduction

                            requested me to call and to submit substance of oral communication to my
                            government.</p>

                            protocol. Sweden indicating it is not satisfied, Swiss indicating they
                            are only partially satisfied and both reserving right to a second stage
                            (deuxieme etape).</p>
                        <p>Zehnder pointed out whereas up to present Communists had right to
                            maintain 10 delegates in South Korea, that is 2 on each of 5 teams,
                            contemplated arrangement would reduce number of Communist delegates in
                            South Korea to 3. He said this marked considerable progress and although
                            it would not satisfy Rhee Zehnder expressed opinion it might greatly
                            reduce burden of protecting Communist delegates. As it constituted
                            progress toward goal sought Zehnder earnestly expressed hope United
                            States Government although not satisfied would not cause rejection
                            proposed reduction when it comes before <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss>. He emphasized that it was merely the first stage. He
                            said at present he could not give outline of second stage or of timing
                            but indicated next step would be on diplomatic level as Swiss see <pb
                                n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0111"/>little hope of further progress
                            in <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> under present circumstances.
                            Zehnder expressed belief that although Communists not ready to abolish
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> or withdraw teams to DZ
                            something possible if Swiss approach Chinese on basis Swiss
                            dissatisfaction functioning of NNITS. He indicated he believes ChiComs
                            do not want breakdown of armistice and will therefore yield further if
                            pressed, and that new approach therefore worth a try.</p>
                        <p>As Swiss already know of our desire for abolition <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> first diplomatic approach probably to
                            Peking not Washington. Zehnder pointed out that during conversations it
                            would be better to have only 3 rather than 10 Communist delegates in
                            South Korea. This he hoped would be added inducement for United States
                            not to reject <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> proposal.
                            Furthermore rejection would throw away opportunity for some progress
                            here as acceptance would make possible second step.</p>
                        <p>Zehnder urgently requested that Swiss views be communicated to my
                            government with earnest request that United States not reject <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> proposal. He also stated French and

                                    objectives, or at least to make Washington aware of the great
                                    importance that we attach to them:” (paragraphs 1 and 2

                                    level. This will do more to speed recovery than any other single

                            </quote></p>
                        <p>We can expect major crisis unless we accept fixing of rate for at least
                            one year. No certainty he will not demand permanent rate but indications
                            are he would accept proposal he recently made to Liberal Party
                            Committee, which was indorsed by Committee, that rate be fixed for one
                            year and then revised. On basis of experience last June when we took
                            action to change military conversion rate under then existing
                            agreements, I am apprehensive that major fight may develop at end of
                            year. If we wish to make change at that time no matter what our
                            agreement on subject stated.</p>
                        <p>If we were to contemplate agreement in June to fix rate for year, I
                            believe President will insist fixing value Hwan far above its present
                            realistic value. Figure of 350 to dollar is so frequently mentioned that
                            it may be he has already decided on this. It would be unwise fix rate
                            even at real value of Hwan at beginning of year since our forecast for
                                <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1956 indicated substantial degree
                            of inflation.</p>
                        <p>I fear device of permitting President to fix an “official rate” at an
                            unrealistic level while using various devices to have great bulk of
                            transaction carried on at different rates is no longer open to us since
                            it is clear he will insist that all transactions must take place at rate
                            set and he will insist on enforcing this rate by drastic police action
                            and all other means he can think of. If we accept it, this would mean
                            that all Hwan requirements would be obtained thru drawing system at
                            official rate, aid goods would be priced at that rate and any further
                            progress towards realistic pricing would be impossible. All old evils of
                            greatly stimulated black markets and windfall profits to favorites would
                            return in full force. I see no satisfactory course except face issue on
                            its merits, refuse agree to fixed rate at this time, and be prepared for
                            acrimonious controversy that is bound ensue.</p>
                        <p>There may be considerable advantage in having negotiations take place in
                            Washington rather than Seoul. This could be suggested by us without
                            potential embarrassment because President stated last month he wished
                            send mission to discuss this and other subjects and our response to him
                            that June might be appropriate time do this.<note n="4" xml:id="d43fn4"

                            an exploitable propaganda issue.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, our Allies have thus far been unconvinced by any evidence we
                            have been able to offer them that paragraphs 13(c) and (d) should be
                            denounced. They do not doubt Communist violations of the Armistice, but
                            are unconvinced that the build-up is of such magnitude as seriously to
                            jeopardize the security of the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> and
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Moreover, they do not
                            anticipate any renewal of hostilities by the Chinese Communists. They
                            believe strongly that denunciation of these provisions of the Armistice
                            Agreement would increase Far Eastern tensions. Before concurring in such
                            à step, they want to be assured that there will be a positive gain in
                            terms of efforts to counterbalance the Communist build-up, and that an
                            adequate public case <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0115"/>for
                            denunciation can be made. They understand that for both military and
                            political reasons we do not want to permit the Communists to violate the
                            Armistice with impunity, but in the absence of a demonstration that
                            serious military risks are involved, they think that these
                            considerations are transcended by the interest in relaxing tensions in
                            the Far East. With a more convincing public case, and with assurances of
                            intent and immediate need to strengthen our military position vis-à-vis
                            the Communists, there is a slim possibility of obtaining Allied
                            concurrence.</p>
                        <p>Without the concurrence of our Allies in denunciation of these Armistice
                            terms, the U.S. would have to be prepared to assume sole responsibility
                            for the decision in the United Nations. Our authority under the Security
                            Council Resolution<note n="5" xml:id="d44fn5">Apparently a reference to
                                the resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council on July 7, 1950,
                                which established a unified command in Korea under the United States
                                and requested the United States to designate a commander for the
                                U.N. forces in Korea. (U.N. doc. S/1588)</note> would probably not
                            be regarded as going so far. The result would almost certainly be the
                            effective dissolution of the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> and the
                            end of the Unified Command. Our Allies would, moreover, be in a position
                            to consider themselves relieved of any obligations under the Joint
                            Policy Declaration. Dissolution of the <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> would free the U.S. from close, frequent, and often
                            troublesome consultation with its Allies on the Korean situation, who in
                            any event are now providing only token military forces. Unilateral
                            action by the U.S., however, could not remove the need for consultation
                            on this policy, and would isolate the U.S. morally, cause further Allied
                            misgivings with respect to U.S. Far Eastern policy, could increase the
                            difficulties of united action by the Free World.</p>

                                The United Nations Command must take a position on this proposal,
                                which the Communists will doubtless approve, in the Military

                                    >Taylor</persName> has recommended that this occasion be seized
                                to propose in the Military Armistice Commission that the <gloss

                                clearly inoperative and unworkable provisions of a treaty or

                                There are some precedents in international law to support such
                                suspension of provisions as contrasted with unilateral and absolute

                                able to accomplish through this approach after many months of effort
                                was the unanimous agreement cited above of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. You might point out that in
                                addition to the serious matter of principle involved, it has been
                                only with the greatest of effort and at the cost of very
                                considerable strains on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-U.S.
                                relationships that the U.S. has been able to protect the Communist
                                personnel of the inspection teams. While the Swiss and Swedes have
                                assured us that their agreement with the Czechs and Poles represents
                                only a first stage and that they plan (at some undefined point in
                                time) a further step, we believe that we can no longer run the risks
                                involved of a possible conflict between <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                    >UNC</gloss> and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> personnel
                                over the safety of the Czechs and Poles. Moreover we have no
                                assurance that the Swiss and Swedes will be willing in the future to
                                act without the agreement of the Communists and there is no reason
                                to think that the Communists will agree to elimination of the teams
                                altogether.</item>

                            <item>You might also point out that the proposed action relates entirely

                                >Macmillan</persName> this morning about Korean <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. I described to him present situation
                            in detail whereby <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> is hamstrung in
                            North Korea by Communists whereas in South they have full access due to
                            our strict observance letter and spirit of Korean armistice. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> did not seem fully aware of
                            situation and said he now understood our problem. He promised to look at
                            it again with view to seeing how <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            might be appropriately wound up and said he assumed we would keep Makins
                            fully informed of our thinking.</p>
                        <p>I then said to him we had another serious problem regarding replacement
                            of military equipment in South Korea where we would probably have to cut
                            some corners re letter of Korean armistice. Under present circumstances
                            we cannot replace obsolete military equipment which is no longer in
                            production unless we continue production of obsolete equipment. This was
                            particularly applicable to aircraft. I explained that theory of
                            armistice was that it would be quickly followed by political conference
                            leading to replacement of armistice by some form of agreement. We were
                            now faced with situation of indefinite duration where either we replace
                            obsolete equipment with comparable but modern types or we adhere to
                            strict observance of Korean armistice thus permitting defense posture of
                            South Korea to be very seriously impaired.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> said he was unaware of
                            this problem but was very sympathetic to it. He compared it to someone’s
                            owning 1939 Ford who wished to replace it with new car but was unable to
                            do so unless Ford started reproducing 1939 models. I said to him that we
                            were faced with two possibilities: One was to void the pertinent
                            armistice provisions and other was to simply go ahead and replace
                            obsolete equipment with more modern types. In fact this was what
                            Communists were doing in North Korea where they were continuously <pb
                                n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0119"/>violating agreed equipment levels
                            by the introduction of jet aircraft and other items which had not been
                            in Korea when armistice was concluded. I said I tentatively leaned
                            toward simply replacing obsolete equipment with more modern types but
                            had reached no firm conclusions. Obviously this is a delicate matter.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> concluded by saying
                            he fully appreciated our problem and hoped we would also keep Makins
                            fully informed of our thinking so that we could have solid common
                            approach.</p>

                        <p><gloss target="#t_Dulte1">Dulte</gloss> 39. I raised with <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> question of Commonwealth
                            forces in Korea and pled with him not to cut down forces anymore than
                            was absolutely necessary. While recognizing British desire to get ahead
                            with organizing defense of Malaya I pointed out effect on other U.N.
                            powers of substantial reduction of Commonwealth forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> replied concept of
                            maintaining Commonwealth brigade group no longer made sense now that
                            Canadians had gone and Australians had made it clear that they wished to
                            redeploy their battalion. He mentioned importance of Menzies’ efforts to
                            change Australian policy so that it would be accepted fact that
                            Australian units could be deployed outside of Australia in peacetime. In
                            light of present circumstances U.K. military felt strongly it did not
                            make sense to try to maintain full brigade group headquarters when there
                            was going to be only one battalion and they were anxious to redeploy
                            certain elements of brigade headquarters and supporting elements
                            elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>He said however he understood our problem and “would try his level best
                            by a bit of showmanship” to make Commonwealth forces look as substantial
                            as possible. He promised to speak to Field Marshal Harding<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d47fn2">Field Marshal Sir John Harding, Chief of the British

                            sympathetic our problem I am convinced in my own mind that there is no
                            way we can prevent them from reducing Commonwealth forces in Korea to
                            something just short of a battalion which I think they will make earnest
                            effort <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0120"/>to portray as being more
                            than a battalion by calling it combat group or some such name.</p>

                            its inspection teams in Korea. After reminding the Council of the

                            by the Swiss and Swedes presented the United States with an opportunity
                            to propose in the Military Armistice Commission the complete abolition
                            of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, as well as the abrogation
                            of paragraphs 13–c and 13–d of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which
                            prevented either side in the Armistice from bringing in any new matériel

                                Defense.<note n="5" xml:id="d48fn5">See <ref target="#d45">Document
                                    45</ref>.</note> In the course of this discussion two possible
                            courses of action <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0121"/>had emerged.
                            One possible course was unilateral action by the United States to
                            suspend the activities of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            inspection teams while doing nothing about paragraphs 13–c and 13–d of
                            the Armistice Agreement. The second possible course of action was
                            unilateral action by the United States to suspend the activities of the
                            inspection teams and likewise to abrogate paragraphs 13–c and 13–d of
                            the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>The discussion resulted in a decision by the President to inform
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>’s recommendation and
                            of the President’s tentative feeling that it might well be possible for
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> to suspend the
                            activities of the inspection teams after Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had consulted with the British
                            and French to ascertain their reaction. Accordingly, today or tomorrow
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> would presumably
                            propose to the British and French a suspension of the operations of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> inspection teams in
                                Korea.<note n="6" xml:id="d48fn6">For a summary of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ discussion with <persName
                                    corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>, see <ref target="#d46"
                                    >Document 46</ref>. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                    >Dulles</persName> did not discuss the problem with the French
                                while he was in Paris.</note> On the other hand, with respect to the
                            abrogation of paragraphs 13–c and 13–d, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> explained that the President believed that such
                            a U.S. move should await fuller consultation with the sixteen countries
                            who represented the United Nations Command allies in Korea. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> went on to point out
                            that these decisions were wholly consistent with existing U.S. policy,
                            and that our policy on Korea would not require revision unless these
                            proposed actions by the United States involved jeopardizing the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> set-up in Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President then commented that he had in mind merely to have the
                            Council kept informed of these developments. It appeared to him that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commander in the field did have
                            the right to suspend the activities of the inspection teams if such
                            activities jeopardized the security of the <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed
                            agreement with the President, and went on to ask if the time was not
                            also approaching when we would have to get rid of paragraphs 13–c and
                            13–d of the Armistice Agreement. The President replied that this might
                            well be the case, but he felt that the State Department was altogether
                            right in not wishing to take any action at this time which could result
                            in jeopardizing the United Nations Command structure in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he
                            wished to clear up two important points. It was his understanding, he
                            continued, that if General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> suspended any further mobile inspections, he
                            could bring the inspection teams into the demilitarized zone and keep
                            them there. Secondly, it was Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName>’s understanding that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> already possessed the authority
                            to refuse any further requests by the Communists for inspection in South
                            Korea.</p>
                        <pb n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0122"/>
                        <p>The President said that in any event it was essential that the
                            Departments of State and Defense have a common understanding as to what
                            we have agreed upon.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> pointed out his
                            very great doubt whether the British could be expected to do very much
                            about any of these problems until after the conclusion of the general
                                election.<note n="7" xml:id="d48fn7">Reference is to the British
                                general election of May 26, 1955.</note> The President repeated his
                            warning that we must be sure that we know what we are doing. It was
                            desirable to tell General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            to go slow on any refusal of further mobile inspections for at least a
                            week or two.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> called in Minister
                            Scott and Ambassador de Murville and in separate conversations explained
                            the President’s suggestion to suspend provisionally the unworkable
                            clauses of the Armistice relating to the operations of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and the inspection teams on the
                            grounds that clearly inoperative and unworkable provisions of a treaty
                            or agreement may be suspended by either party pending agreement of the
                            signatories upon satisfactory arrangements for making those provisions
                            workable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> also stressed the need
                            to do something about paragraphs 13(c) and (d) of the Armistice and
                            expressed the hope that action on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> would be a step in the direction of facing up to the
                            problem posed by Communist violation of the reinforcing restrictions. He
                            explained that the Secretary had discussed the matter with Foreign
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> in Paris and
                            had hoped to be able to discuss the matter with Foreign Minister Pinay.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> requested that urgent
                            consideration be given the President’s suggestion on the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> by the French and British Governments
                            and pointed out that we desired to receive their views before discussing
                            the matter with the Sixteen.</p>
                        <p>Minister Scott said he had seen a copy of a telegram from <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> to Eden on the conversations
                            with the Secretary. <persName corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName>,
                            however, had reported only on the question of paragraphs 13(c) and (d)
                            of the Armistice, and had not mentioned the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. With respect to the former problem, <persName
                                corresp="#p_MH1">Macmillan</persName> had told Eden that in view of
                            the situation created by the Communist violations, if anything were to
                            be done, he saw only two alternatives: that is, either to permit the
                            Command to replace its worn out and obsolete equipment covertly or, and
                            he much preferred this solution, to make a forthright announcement that
                            in view of the Communist violations the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command was constrained to announce its intention to
                            replace its equipment as it became obsolete with more modern arms.
                            Minister Scott said the principal difficulty the British found with such
                            action was the problem of public relations and stressed the need for
                            persuasive publicly usable evidence of the extent of Communist
                            violations. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> questioned
                            the need to cite chapter and verse when we were all agreed that the
                            Communists had violated the Armistice, and expressed the feeling that
                            there was a tendency on the part of some of our friends to “sweep the
                            matter under the rug” since the U.S. was, so to speak, “holding the
                            bag”. He stated that this problem was urgent for the U.S. and we were
                            not in a position to have it ignored. By permitting the continuance of

                        <p>Ambassador de Murville stated that he had received no word from Minister
                            Pinay on discussions relating to the Korean Armistice with the
                            Secretary. In response to the Ambassador’s question, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we were primarily concerned
                            at this time with suspending entirely the operations of the Communists
                            in the Republic of Korea by a decision expressed through the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command. While the Armistice has no
                            escape clause there is plenty of precedent for declaring a part of an
                            agreement invalid and inoperative until better arrangements had been
                            worked out by both sides. In response to a further question, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that
                            reinforcement of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command and
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> troops with modern weapons would
                            not be accomplished at once but that action taken on the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> would, we hoped, lead in that
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador de Murville wondered whether this would be the best solution
                            and asked why, if we had a strong case to make on the question of
                            Communist violations, we didn’t make it public? It was pointed out to
                            the Ambassador that a good deal of publicity had been given these
                            violations, but that only through public statements by the Sixteen and
                            through active efforts on the part of each could the problem really be
                            fixed in the public mind.</p>
                        <p>Stating that it seemed to him we had two worries, first the danger of an
                            incident between the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams and the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and second, and more
                            importantly, the fact that article 13 was being violated, the Ambassador
                            asked if the proposal already made by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> might not have substantially reduced the danger of an
                            incident. He also wondered if we shouldn’t discuss the matter with the
                            Communist Governments to find a solution. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that while
                            implementation of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> proposal
                            would reduce the danger somewhat, it did not by any means eliminate it.
                            As for political discussions with the Communists on a political level,
                            we already had had those at Panmunjom since the Communist military there
                            were in fact political officers.</p>
                        <p>Both Minister Scott and Ambassador de Murville promised to ask for the
                            views of their Governments on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            as a matter of urgency.</p>

                                    principal objective is unification of Korea in his lifetime. His
                                    real objection to Armistice is based upon his belief that this
                                    arrangement is an impediment to unification of Korea which he
                                    insists can only be achieved by force. He would undoubtedly see
                                    the U.S. decision to end compliance with the Armistice as an
                                    opportunity to obtain additional military supplies to achieve
                                    his objective. In other words, we could expect a series of early
                                    requests for large amounts of the most modern weapons and
                                    equipment including both jet planes and [<hi rend="italic">less
                                        than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. It is our
                                    understanding that current American military plans in the Far
                                    East do not include the provisions of such supplies to the
                                        <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. In fact, it is
                                    understood that the abrogation of paragraph 13d of the Armistice
                                    would not materially affect the current U.S. military program
                                    for Korea. Therefore, we would have to turn down <persName

                                    justify such rejections by reference to the Armistice Agreement.
                                    As a result, the U.S. and not the Armistice Agreement would

                                        for assuring U.S. support for unification of Korea by force.
                                        As they see it, the U.S. would not be able to withhold
                                        support for a drive north if the U.S. had become militarily

                                        away from this possibility have been greeted by Koreans with
                                        disappointment and dismay. A decision by the U.S. to end
                                        compliance with the Armistice terms would be interpreted by

                                    <p>If as it appears to us here on basis of no very privileged
                                        information the U.S. Government has decided to undertake
                                        negotiations with the Soviet Union on a broad range of
                                        issues affecting world tensions, continued compliance with
                                        Korean Armistice terms would appear to contribute towards
                                        success of those negotiations. A decision to end compliance

                                <item>A U.S. decision to stop compliance with the Armistice
                                    Agreement would have very adverse propaganda effects. North
                                    Korean propaganda is based on a heterogeneous collection of
                                    claims, assertions and insinuations which have no basis in fact.
                                    As a result, credibility is low. A decision to end compliance
                                    with the Armistice probably would give a factual basis for North
                                    Korean propaganda and would lend credibility to their other
                                    unfounded assertions. An action of this kind on part of U.S.
                                    would be cited as factual proof of Commie contentions that the
                                    U.S. seeks international tension and war. The effect of this
                                    propaganda, not only in the Far East, but among large segments
                                    of Europeans, should not be discounted.</item>

                                <item>In a broader context, the U.S. position in Asia rests in large
                                    part upon Asian appreciation that U.S. policy is based on
                                    principles, including observance of the pledged word. In Asian
                                    minds this sharply distinguishes U.S. policy from power politics
                                    of European nations. Continued observance of this policy may be
                                    temporarily disadvantageous, but in long run, it gives us
                                    strength and obtains for us Asian respect and
                                    cooperations.</item>

                            respect to suspension of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission

                            which he thereupon handed to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName>. Sir <persName>Robert</persName> indicated that
                            the matter had been carefully considered in London after the Foreign
                            Minister returned from Paris, on the basis of his conversation with the
                            Secretary. They had concluded that the heart of the problem appeared to
                            be military reinforcement, which would not be directly assisted by the
                            present U.S. proposal, and they thought there were most important
                            political objections to any action at this time which tended to weaken
                            the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that both the
                            Department of State and our military have felt it would be unwise to
                            take action which would amount to barefaced violation of the Armistice.
                            Sir <persName>Robert</persName> suggested that the language of the
                            Armistice Agreement was not so explicit that it would not be possible to
                            give a somewhat liberal interpretation, to the word “types”, for
                            instance. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said we
                            thought the language was pretty tight and that the Neutral Nations had
                            given it a tight interpretation which would be difficult now to escape
                            from. Sir <persName>Robert</persName> suggested that it would be
                            possible for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command to give fewer
                            details from now on to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> on the
                            ground that the other side was not giving details.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Robert</persName> also emphasized that the British would
                            not suggest that any action to be taken with respect to introducing more
                            modern equipment be discussed with the other participating nations. He
                            thought that we should discuss at the most with them the proposal made
                            by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and now pending in the
                            Military Administering Commission.</p>
                        <p>There was a discussion of whether a public suspension of the operations
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> would cause any serious
                            public reactions in view of the public case we could make. Sir
                                <persName>Robert</persName> agreed that we could undoubtedly make a
                            case but his Government felt that it would still be unwise to stir up
                            the issue, especially since the proposed action did not meet the
                            military problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that our
                            military were now considering the public release of further information
                            on violations by the Communists. It was agreed that this was a good
                            thing to do no matter what course of action is decided upon.</p>

                            they are not favorably disposed toward the proposal.<note n="3"

                                    >Murphy</persName> that the French Government felt that the

                                the U.N. Command in the Military Armistice Commission. A further
                                effort to eliminate the inspection teams, the French felt, could
                                perhaps be made later. (Memorandum of conversation by <persName

                        <p>The British counterproposed that we (1) accept the proposal by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> for a reduction in its personnel and
                            number of teams as the best solution that can be secured at the moment;
                            and (2) permit the Command, without further declaration, to introduce
                            discreetly such weapons as it believes are necessary. While this
                            proposal goes to the heart of the problem as defined by our military,
                            there is serious doubt about the feasibility of either introducing more
                            modern weapons covertly or interpreting the Armistice so as to give us
                            substantially increased latitude, in view of the interpretations already
                            adopted by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Since concealment
                            for any period is impossible, and since we have legal grounds, in view
                            of Communist violations, for suspending the military reinforcement
                            provisions, we would be better off before world opinion if we did so

                                    than the economic resources of the country can support and that

                                    assistance and support. This point is axiomatic and requires no
                                    elaboration. We are prepared to discount, on Mr.

                                    civilian economy; Mr. <persName>Wood</persName> suggested the

                                    proposal. This would undoubtedly have most serious effects on

                                broader look at the situation and to re-examine the entire armistice
                                agreement to determine its suitability for long-term application to

                            <item>The armistice agreement was never intended to apply for an
                                indefinite period of time in the manner of a treaty or a mutual
                                defense pact. Its highly restrictive provisions were acceptable to
                                the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> as a means of insuring that
                                the Communists did not use the period of respite provided by the
                                cease-fire to reinforce and re-equip its forces. In this respect,
                                the armistice agreement has been an utter failure. In fact, the only
                                substantive provision of the agreement which has been strictly
                                observed by both sides is the cease-fire. It would appear desirable,
                                therefore, for the 16 nations to recognize that the present
                                agreement has, except for this essential element, outlived its
                                usefulness and should be discarded in recognition of a de facto
                                condition of peace in Korea. Since the replacement of the present
                                agreement by a more suitable negotiated instrument offers only the

                                        contributing forces in Korea for the purpose of appraising
                                        the current military-political situation in Korea. As a
                                        result of this appraisal, it would be recognized that
                                        aggression against the Republic of Korea has been defeated.
                                        The council would take formal note of the fact that the
                                        armistice agreement had as its principal objective,
                                        following the cease-fire, the ultimate withdrawal of foreign
                                        forces from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean

                            what Defense suggests. Defense had not intended to suspend the reporting

                            Rather, Defense wanted to suspend the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"

                            meanwhile to continue reporting.</p>
                        <p>In answer to questions from the Secretary he said that the primary
                            objective at the moment was not to put in the new equipment but to get
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams out of the <gloss

                            13(d) problem could be handled later. He said that this is consistent
                            with the Presidential decision.<note n="5" xml:id="d57fn5">See <ref

                        <p>The Secretary said that so far as 13(d) is concerned he could not see
                            that there is a very serious problem. The Armistice was never intended
                            to last forever. The United States should avoid getting caught up in
                            legal maneuvers designed to abolish provisions of the Armistice. Instead
                            we should give a reasonable interpretation to the provisions of the
                            Armistice and simply go ahead and put into Korea the equipment we need
                            to put into Korea and tell the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            that we are doing so.</p>
                        <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0140"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said that the United
                            States could not very well take that action alone but should get the
                            agreement of the Sixteen.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that we should simply inform the Sixteen as to what we
                            plan to do. The basic intent of the Armistice was to maintain military
                            power commensurate with the other side. It is necessary to make a choice
                            between a literal interpretation or a practical interpretation of the
                            Armistice—between the spirit and the letter of the agreement. The
                            Communists are already interpreting it to allow them to put in new
                            models and there is no reason why we should not simply do so, citing the
                            Communists’ example. This is much better than getting into a legal
                            argument or an effort to renegotiate the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> pointed out that it
                            would be necessary to report to the United Nations.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he was not
                            sure that the Canadians and some of our other allies would be willing to
                            let us go ahead on this basis. He added, however, that if we took some
                            such action with respect to reinforcing material our problem with the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would be considerably eased, and
                            we might therefore have less difficulty in coping with their resistance
                            to having <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams stationed in
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> commented that we
                            would need to tell our allies on a confidential basis exactly what
                            equipment we would plan to put into Korea under this interpretation of
                            13(d).</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>
                            would prepare a statement of the interpretation of the Armistice which
                            could be made first to the Sixteen and then reported to the United
                            Nations.</p>
                        <p>It was also agreed that for the present we would not take summary action
                            with respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> but would let
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> go ahead with the agreed
                            reduction, indicating that this in our view did not solve the problem
                            but that we had no objection to their proceedig with the contemplated
                            reduction.</p>

                                the Embassy and had to be driven back with rifle butts. Police kept
                                the demonstrators away from the Embassy on June 9. The Embassy
                                reported the situation to the Department in telegram 1354, June 8.

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> asked about
                            progress in the activation of the reserve divisions, and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung</persName> replied that eight of
                            the ten had been activated. The only problem remaining in the reserve
                            program is weapons and equipment, which thus far have been supplied by
                            drawing them from the active divisions.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung</persName> said that Communist
                            military power in North Korea has increased in five respects: (1) jet
                            planes, (2) airfields, (3) number of tanks, (4) firepower, particularly
                            in mortars and artillery, and (5) movement of Chinese Communist forces
                            into reserve positions, with the North Koreans assuming responsibility
                            for the frontline areas. He said <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            estimates of North Korean strength differ slightly from ours, in that
                            they include service troops in their estimate of about 400,000, of which
                            330,000 are combat units. Combat units of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Army, he said, number about 300,000. The <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is not concerned about the North Korean
                            forces, which they believe they could easily handle, and which are
                            inordinately large relative to the population, but it is troubled by
                            Communist China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> commented that
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> security in the final analysis,
                            as has often been pointed out, is based on the Joint Policy Declaration
                            of 1953 and subsequent policy statements indicating that the United
                            States and its Allies would react vigorously to renewed aggression in
                            Korea and would not confine their counter-action to the Korean area.
                            General <persName corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung</persName> agreed, but said
                            that as a military commander of forces directly confronting the
                            Communists he is troubled by evidences of Western disunity and reduction
                            of forces as a result of the Communist peace or co-existence offensive.
                            He believes the Communists are steadily increasing their strength, and
                            that their leaders, unlike those of the West, can launch an aggression
                            at any time without regard for public opinion. He urged that <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces be kept at their present
                            strength as a front-line for United States defense <pb n="115"
                                xml:id="pg_115" facs="0143"/>and in order to buy time in the event
                            of Communist atomic attack. He said that he learned while he was an
                            officer in the Japanese forces fighting the Russians in Manchuria that
                            the Russians do not spend much of their military budget on such things
                            as food. He expressed fear that the Communists may be closing the gap in
                            atomic weapons, citing in particular a Japanese magazine article on
                            atomic activity in western China. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1"
                                >McClurkin</persName> said that those in a position to know say that
                            contrary to sensational stories in the newspapers we still are
                            maintaining preponderance in the atomic field.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung</persName> said that his
                            experience in China and Manchuria in World War II impressed him greatly
                            with the effectiveness of Communist techniques of control. For
                            propaganda purposes he says much to his troops about the implications of
                            the refusal of the great majority of the Chinese Communist prisoners in
                            Korea to be repatriated, but he must say candidly to us that he believes
                            that Communist China is steadily increasing its internal controls and

                            high-ranking officers in the Chinese Nationalist Army whom he has known
                            for many years, and believes that Nationalist China already has a
                            serious morale problem in its military forces.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung</persName> expressed concern
                            about Japanese policies toward the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            and toward trade with the Communists. He said that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is too often blamed for the lack of
                            progress in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>-Japanese negotiations,
                            inasmuch as the Japanese negotiate in tricky fashion and apparently want
                            to build up Japan’s strength before bringing the negotiations to a
                            conclusion. He strongly criticized Japan’s trade with the Communists,
                            and urged that the United States press Japan not to form ties with
                            Communist China and North Korea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1"
                                >McClurkin</persName> pointed out that Japan’s trade interests are
                            heavily in the free world, and that this will inevitably influence
                            Japan’s policies. General <persName corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung</persName>
                            said that he came to know much about Japanese psychology as one of the
                            two Korean cadets in the Japanese military academy, and he feels that
                            there is danger for the West in Japan’s current trend toward independent
                            policies. He mentioned the possibility that the Hatoyama<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d59fn2">Ichiro Hatoyama, Japanese Prime Minister.</note>
                            government might be succeeded by a leftist government strongly inclined
                            toward relations with the Communists, and urged the United States to
                            exert pressures now so that the new generation of leaders would not
                            drift in that direction. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1"
                                >McClurkin</persName> assured him that the United States has seen
                            some dangers in trends in Japan and is working on them in its own
                            fashion; only time will tell if we will succeed.</p>

                                xml:id="pg_116" facs="0144"/>morale. In closing, he said that the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is “putting everything in one
                            boat,” piloted by the United States, and must and will follow after
                            United States leadership. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1"
                                >McClurkin</persName> said that the United States is constantly

                            have identical aims in the struggle against Communism and that we can

                            to increase 180 rate to 270 because wholesale price index increased 51%

                        <p>US proposal laid before <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> as follows:
                            US believes rate flexibility essential since stability not achieved nor
                            in sight. Believe that arrangement contained in Agreed Minute

                                1955.</note> The letter recommended provisional suspension of the

                            would be done after informing the Sixteen and the United Nations. Having
                            done this we would then proceed to introduce modern weapons as military

                                    >Document 57</ref>.</note> and the decision which had been taken
                            as to correcting the military imbalance after reporting to the United
                            Nations on our interpretation of the Armistice Agreement. He said it had
                            also been understood that we would accept the reductions proposed in the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> as a stop-gap measure.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> went back to a
                            meeting that he, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                            >Radford</persName>, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            and Dillon<persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> had had with
                            the President to discuss this problem.<note n="6" xml:id="d63fn6"
                                >Reference is to the May 11 meeting; see <ref target="#d45">Document
                                    45</ref>.</note> At that meeting there had been an emphasis on
                            the problem created in the Republic of Korea by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Defense had suggested that the
                            military commander should say in the Military Armistice Commission that
                            the inspection system does not work. Until it was possible to agree with
                            the Communists upon means to make it work, the United Nations Command
                            was going to suspend the operation of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> on a
                            provisional basis and move the teams to the demilitarized zone. The
                            President thought that that might be an adequate solution but suggested
                            that they talk with the Secretary of State. He had added that if this
                            measure was taken surely the military commanders were ingenious enough
                            to take care of their own best interests in Korea, but it was clear that
                            they could not do it with the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            looking over their shoulders. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                                >Anderson</persName> went on to say that clearly there was a problem
                            which was not taken care of by the Department of State proposal which
                            would continue reports to a diminished <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. He said that, for example, we could not introduce 280
                            mm. cannon into Korea and give the Communists the right or opportunity
                            to inspect the cannon. In addition, there is an even wider consideration
                            in that the Soviet Union is already proposing machinery for general
                            disarmament which would be roughly comparable to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. If we deal publicly with the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in Korea in a way which emphasizes
                            its ineffectiveness, the inherent weakness of the <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> proposals will be exposed.</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that our
                            great concern at the moment is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the early
                            introduction of new weapons, which would be even some disadvantage to
                            us. The right to introduce them would cause us a little difficulty since
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would want some of them and we
                            do not want to give them to the Republic of Korea.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that the
                            importance of the equipment needs in Korea varies from service to
                            service and type to type. The Air Force has been hurt the worst and has
                            had to move units out of Korea. However, the situation is not now
                            critical, although a year from now it will be. He emphasized that it is
                            not realistic to divide the problem of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> and Paragraph 13(d) unless the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> could be handled first.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> will not allow any
                            more mobile inspection teams in South Korea.</p>

                                State, Central Files, 795.00/ 6–2955)</note> indicating his belief
                            that the action proposed with respect to 13(d) would be greeted with
                            enthusiasm by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and
                            would make it possible to live for a while with the <gloss

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he did
                            not agree with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName>
                            and thought that he hadn’t been there long enough to understand the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> commented on the way
                            this problem has been switched back and forth two or three times between
                            handling the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and 13(d) but said
                            that after the last meeting we had worked out our proposal reflecting
                            what we thought had been agreed. He pointed out that the problem of
                            13(c) is entirely different from that of 13(d) and that linking the two
                            problems simply because these were the two kinds of things the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> could inspect created difficulties.
                            On the general problem of inspection, if the Communists have refused to
                            carry out the intent and spirit of the inspection provisions something
                            can be worked out to relieve the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> of
                            an unfair burden.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he does not like the idea of blindfolding the
                            inspectors so that we can violate the Armistice. To do so leaves us in a
                            very bad position. As he had said in the earlier meeting, he prefers the
                            device of putting a reasonable interpretation upon the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> said that he agreed
                            completely and would be glad to have our position on the introduction of
                            weapons handled publicly, but he believes that we must get rid of the
                            inspection people first.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked why it was necessary to
                            raise the issue of 13(c).</p>
                        <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0151"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that it was
                            only because (13(c) is one of the two kinds of inspections to be
                            performed by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said that it was not
                            necessary to attack the problem from this angle. It could be attacked
                            from the point of view of lack of fulfillment by the Communists of their
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> obligations under the
                            Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that there is one new thought which had been advanced
                            by Defense. Namely, that they apparently want to put into Korea some
                            highly sensitive new equipment which they don’t want anyone to have the
                            right to inspect.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that it
                            was not necessarily true that they wanted to do so right away but that
                            this was in the cards, for example, with F860’s or new tanks.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that from the political standpoint this question has
                            some of the same implications as the great debate about Yalta. The
                            question had been whether we should denounce the Yalta Agreement. It had
                            been decided not to do so but to keep ourselves in a flexible position
                            under which we could continue to say that the Communists are violating
                            the Yalta Agreement. If we had denounced it, the Communists could go
                            ahead with any violations and we would have no more case against them.
                            On the whole question of inspection he wants to be in a position at
                                Geneva<note n="8" xml:id="d63fn8">The Four-Power Conference at
                                Geneva began on July 18, 1955.</note> to point out constantly to the
                            Communists the violations they have committed. He still thinks that all
                            Defense wants to do can be accomplished without losing our trading
                            position by giving the Armistice Agreement a reasonable
                            interpretation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_ARB1">Anderson</persName> asked if we
                            still would not have our trading position if we handled the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> as Defense suggested. He said that we
                            could say that the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> has not worked.
                            We could offer to sit down across the table with the Communists and try
                            to work out means of making it work more effectively, but that meanwhile
                            we could suspend the operations of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> pointed out that
                            as long as the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> continues to
                            operate we will be faced with a serious problem of ourselves having to
                            violate the Armistice at the point at which the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> wants to perform a special inspection in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> because President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> has said he will not allow any more
                            such inspections.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he wants to study the problem a little bit more
                            and have Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> look into it to see
                            whether we can accomplish what Defense wants to accomplish without
                            placing ourselves in the position of violating the Armistice. He said
                            this position of “clean hands” will be particularly valuable to us in
                            the next few weeks. He still believes that we can perhaps accomplish
                            what we want to accomplish by interpretation. He suggested that perhaps
                            there might be merit in playing with the idea of cutting down or

                            and things which must be kept confidential.</p>

                            from the Committee of Sixteen and that it was up to this Government to
                            put additional pressure on the Sixteen to agree now to dismantling the
                            Commission. He and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> pointed out that the danger of action by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> against the inspection teams is
                            not removed merely by reducing the number of teams. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stressed that the main problem
                            was with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and that we must at
                            all costs avoid creating a situation in which we would have to shoot
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces in order to protect the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. He pointed out that the U.S.
                            is the only nation which has any real stake in Korea and expressed
                            strong doubts that the Sixteen, having agreed only to reduce the number
                            of inspection teams, would then two months later agree to abolish the
                            teams entirely. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            and General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> thought that
                            we must bring the problem to a head and that we have already continued
                            too long with the present unsatisfactory basis.</p>
                        <pb n="130" xml:id="pg_130" facs="0158"/>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said he liked the
                            idea of suspension of <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations
                            and suggested that that announcement be made by the U.S. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that any such
                            announcement would be a unilateral action on the part of the U.S. and
                            would enable the other side to charge us with violating the armistice.
                            He continued that some of the countries in the United Nations would make
                            a great deal out of such unilateral action on our part. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked for <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> views on how to bring more pressures on
                            the Sixteen in the matter and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> suggested that they just be told what we intend
                            to do.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested another
                            tactic: to propose that both the Chinese Communists and the United
                            Nations withdraw entirely their forces from Korea. He said he was
                            prepared to do this but could not speak for the other Chiefs. Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> appeared skeptical
                            over this idea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> suggested that the
                            Sixteen are not as worried as we over the imbalance of forces in South
                            and North Korea, and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> mentioned Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ view that we should build up
                            openly. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> remarked
                            that this plan was unacceptable, since we don’t want the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> inspecting our modern equipment.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> remarked that the
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> just do not believe in the
                            two-stage approach and the timing proposed by the Swedes. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that the Swedes do
                            feel the matter could be accomplished in the way they proposed and
                            reiterated the desire of the Swedish Government to be rid of the whole
                            affair.</p>
                        <p>With respect to violations of the armistice by the North Koreans, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> expressed the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> view that there had been a long line of
                            violations which everyone knew about and that feeling in the Sixteen
                            relative to terminating <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> was not
                            getting any better but that the Sixteen could be expected rather to grow
                            more complacent from now on. That was another strong reason for taking
                            vigorous action now to terminate the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> expressed the view that there should be another
                            meeting with the President on the matter to arrive at a decision as to
                            U.S. policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said that we were left
                            with little alternative but to inform the Swedish Government that its
                            proposal is not acceptable. He thought it would be wiser to go forward
                            with their proposal but would report the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> objection to the Secretary of State and recommend that
                            the problem be raised again with the President.<note n="4"

                                        >Dulles</persName> in which he summarized the discussion on

                                    relating to the Korean Armistice. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                        >Robertson</persName> noted the strong desire of the

                                    and concluded:</p>
                                <p>“Our best prospect still seems to be to accept promptly in the

                                    by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Then we should go
                                    ahead with your suggestion that we report to the United Nations
                                    our practical interpretation of the Armistice and proceed openly
                                    as necessary to introduce the weapons which we need to
                                    introduce. The <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> can then be
                                    allowed to wither on the vine. Defense’s problem that it does

                                        >NNSC</gloss> to inspect some of our new weapons can
                                    probably be met through the operation of the time factor since,
                                    as we understand it, it is not immediately intended to introduce
                                    these new weapons and the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                                    may well have died a natural death through Swedish and Swiss

                                    hold another meeting with Defense representatives to discuss the

                                    >Robertson</persName></hi>: Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> has informed me of your
                            discussions, concerning certain editorials in the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Korean Republic</hi> regarding the dollar exchange rate. To tell
                            you the truth, I have no time to read that paper or any other newspaper
                            personally, but someone reads me a daily summary of important items of
                            the press, some editorials and general information.</p>
                        <p>Now that this has been brought to my attention, I have requested the <hi
                                rend="italic">Korean Republic</hi>’s editors to refrain from using
                            such language and expression and to remember our friendship with the US
                            Government. The truth may be told without hurting friendly feelings, in
                            a constructive and amicable way.</p>
                        <p>Public sentiment regarding the problem of the spiral rates of exchange
                            has been boiling because everyone knows that they have been the main
                            cause of our nation’s economic suffering during the past eight years. It
                            seems quite clear to me that the high authorities in Washington do not
                            realize how seriously the constant raising of the dollar exchange,
                            since, and even before the operation of <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss>, has affected the Government and people of this
                            country. Beginning with a rate of 15 Won to a dollar in the American
                            Military Government days, the <gloss target="#t_ECA1">ECA</gloss>
                            officials raised it constantly every 2 or 3 months, doubling a doubled
                            rate and so on, until in 1953 it went as high as 600–1 and they demanded
                            it be raised to 23,000. Each time the dollar price doubled, the market
                            prices doubled also. In Korea the market price of all items goes up,
                            according to the price of the US dollar.</p>
                        <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0160"/>
                        <p>The Government has to set a budget for twelve fiscal months, but each
                            time the dollar price increases the Government is unable to meet its
                            expenditures. Furthermore, how can the people make a living with their
                            earnings, while the prices keep on rising. Naturally, they ask why the
                            United States Government forces us to raise the dollar price, when the
                            rate in Japan and other countries is fixed.</p>
                        <p>They presume it is because the United States Government wishes to build
                            up Japan’s economy with the funds given to Korea for reconstruction of
                            Korea’s economy. Our Government has no answer to that. Each time we have
                            asked that the price be pegged as in other countries, the answer has
                            been that we must have a realistic rate, otherwise we may not receive
                            the aid funds.</p>
                        <p>I do not wish to undertake to explain how the Korea aid funds earmarked
                            for Korean economy have been handled, so as to use as many dollars as
                            possible for Japan. Enough to say that the State Department announced
                            more than once that Korea’s aid funds are to be used twice over. This
                            means simply that with the money and materials given for the
                            reconstruction and rehabilitation of Korean economy, Japanese products
                            are imported for the immediate relief of the suffering Korean people,
                            thereby helping Japan’s economy. Why then do Korea’s aid fund
                            administrators not tell us that the United States aid funds are solely
                            for <hi rend="italic">the immediate</hi> relief of the Korean people and
                            not for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the Korean economy. How
                            can Korea answer later when the American people ask us what we have done
                            with the aid they have given to make Korea a self-supporting nation?</p>
                        <p>We would like to invite all fair-minded people to come and see what
                            industries we have reconstructed with all the aid funds and materials we
                            have received. We want to show them the demolished factories and plants
                            of which only parts of walls and broken chimneys remain, having stood
                            all these years since the Communist invasion of 1950. No aid funds have
                            renovated any of them.</p>
                        <p>In answer to our requests to rebuild some as a basis for reconstructing
                            Korean economy we were told to buy from Japan some of the supplies we
                            needed, such as fertilizer, cement, coal and other items, for that would
                            be cheaper than producing them ourselves. If that is true, how can we
                            ever expect to make Korea a self-supporting nation?</p>
                        <p>If, by building up Japan, the United States might win her as a permanent
                            loyal ally, it could be different. But can any thinking persons in
                            America or anywhere else believe for one moment that Japan will be a
                            dependable friend and ally? Has she not already shown herself to be
                            lining up with the Soviets, Red China and North Korea?</p>
                        <p>Since 1953, we have started on a small scale to reconstruct some of our
                            basic industries, such as fertilizer, cement and power plants. <pb
                                n="133" xml:id="pg_133" facs="0161"/>We are hoping that by
                            continuing to reconstruct many other essential industries, we may once
                            again be a self-supporting nation, with our people reaping the benefit
                            of the generous contributions given Korea for its economic
                            independence.</p>
                        <p>We believe that to build up our economy, the most important and urgent
                            problem is to stabilize our currency, otherwise economic disaster cannot
                            be avoided. I know you will do all you can to save this situation, as
                            you know that this United States policy of continual “doubling up” of
                            the dollar rate leads to disaster. If a change of policy is not possible
                            we see no alternative but to ask our delegates to return home.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Paik</persName> Too Chin has been instructed to present our
                            final request and I earnestly beseech you to look it over.</p>
                        <p>Now that our best hope, the United States, is turning towards Russia, Red
                            China, India and Japan for co-existence, which we cannot support, we
                            have to depend upon ourselves for better or worse. We feel forced to
                            take this sad stand and disappointed, but will try to remain grateful to
                            the United States for all the sacrifice it has made in defense of our
                            common cause, the defense of democracy.<note n="2" xml:id="d68fn2"

                            Kaesong and the Ongjin Peninsula, the President replied that the Govt’s

                            of force and that he did not intend to use force in connection with

                                Office of Public Information issued a press release which demanded
                                the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> from
                                Korea and ordered the withdrawal of Communist forces from Kaesong,
                                Ongjin, and the northern portion of the Han River. (Telegram 139
                                from Seoul, August 2; <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>)</note> He said
                            that the Communists must recognize they had no right to this area which
                            was below the 38th parallel. After describing the circumstances under
                            which they had obtained possession of it, the President said that in all
                            fairness they must give it back. When asked if he believed they would
                            return it as a result of the Govt statement, he muttered rather
                            incoherently that that would depend on whether or not the US and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command backed up his request. Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> asked if he had
                            given any consideration to the possibility of the Communists raising a
                            question concerning the areas the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            hold above the 38th parallel now that he had asked for the return of
                            areas held by the Communists below the parallel. He replied impatiently
                            that our men had fought, bled, and died for the area held above the
                            parallel and in any event the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had a
                            right to all the area north of the parallel.</p>

                                >Lemnitzer</persName> stated clearly that the protection of the

                            problem of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> would be solved to
                            his satisfaction and, he said, “with all possible speed”. Both Gen
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> and I assured him
                            that tremendous efforts had been made and were being made at the very
                            highest levels in our Govt for the solution of this problem. I stated
                            that it was my conviction that great progress had recently been made in
                            this regard.</p>
                        <p>The interview this afternoon lasted half an hour. The President was
                            relatively restrained in his statements but left no doubt concerning his
                            impatience with the delay in resolving the problem of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. It was apparent from our
                            conversation that the statement that was issued by the Govt on Sunday
                            has not been communicated directly to the North Korean Govt. <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Govt appears to consider its
                            publication of the statement constitutes an official communication on
                            its part to the Govt of North Korea.</p>
                        <p>It is our opinion that that Govt’s statement stems from the President’s
                            dissatisfaction with progress on the resolution of the problem of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and from his growing
                            bewilderment and frustration as he sees world tension relaxing and the
                            opportunity to unify his country by the use of force fading away. He may
                            well have had the intention when the announcement was made on Sunday to
                            use force both in recovering the Kaesong area and in ejecting the Czechs
                            and Poles. However, reliable intelligence reports show that in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> conferences subsequent to the
                            announcement the President’s own military leaders were reluctant or
                            unwilling to follow his leadership in any measures that would involve
                            the use of force in either connection. His statements reviewed above
                            undoubtedly reflect his present attitude on the use of force but do not
                            necessarily reflect his intent at the time the statement was issued.</p>

                                    Republic of Korea, you of the following:</p>
                                <p>Whereas the large military build-up in North Korea unequivocally
                                    proves the loss of the raison d’être of the Neutral Nations
                                    Supervisory Commission; whereas the Communist military menace to
                                    the Republic of Korea is ever increasing; whereas, under the
                                    circumstances, the existence of the Communists engaging in
                                    espionage activities in the territories of the Republic of Korea
                                    poses a grave danger to the national security of Korea; and
                                    whereas the Government of the Republic of Korea cannot but take
                                    measures to safeguard the national security by exercising the
                                    right of self-defense of a sovereign nation; now, therefore, the
                                    Government of the Republic of Korea demands the members of the
                                    Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to withdraw from the
                                    territories of the Republic of Korea no later than 2400 hours of
                                    August 13, 1955. And the Government of the Republic of Korea
                                    declares that it cannot assume any responsibility for any
                                    incident occurring to the members of the Commission who fail to

                        <p>At a news conference at the Department of State on August 10, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> expressed sympathy for
                            the Republic of Korea’s concern over the continued presence in South
                            Korea of the Communist members of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams.
                            He added, however, that the United Nations Command had an obligation to
                            protect the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams and stressed that the
                            Republic of Korea should not try to challenge that obligation by force.
                            In response to a question, <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            stated that the United States had no intelligence reports to bear out
                            the Republic of Korea’s contention that renewed Communist aggression in
                            Korea was dangerously near. (Department of State <hi rend="italic"

                            spokesman for the Republic of Korea, issued a press release in which he
                            rejected the assertion that the Republic of Korea was using force in its
                            efforts to expel the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from Korea.
                            Referring to the demonstrations taking place against the Neutral Nations
                            Inspection Teams, Karl stated that, if any violence had occurred, it was
                            due to the use of weapons by U.S. military forces.</p>

                                loudly and excitedly to Major <persName>Kim</persName> of Seoul and
                                two unidentified men. I proceeded to reception room where I waited
                                several minutes while above mentioned conversation took place in
                                Korean just outside door.</item>

                            <item>To my surprise, and notwithstanding my request for a private
                                meeting, President entered room with acting Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs <persName>Cho</persName>. After exchange of greetings I
                                informed President that I had requested private meeting with him in
                                view of experience following our last meeting when others, including
                                    <persName>Cho</persName>, were present. I related that in press
                                conference following this meeting <persName>Cho</persName> was
                                quoted as saying that General White and I had “agreed in principle”
                                with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> proposal to regain Kaesong,
                                Ongjin Peninsula and section of Han River estuary south of 38th
                                parallel. I stated that this statement was not based on fact, as
                                every one present at that conference knew, it had been extremely
                                embarrassing to both General White and myself and had provided
                                valuable propaganda material for Communists. (<hi rend="italic"

                                Although I considered issuing a denial, the fact that it had
                                received so little attention convinced me that to do so would only
                                do more harm than good by giving it world-wide circulation and
                                generating widespread interest in issue, as <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> probably desired.) <persName>Cho</persName> said
                                that he had issued a correction but I informed him that it was
                                poorly worded and technical in nature and did not adequately correct
                                the substance of the original release or erroneous impression it has
                                created. I felt that only a clear-cut retraction on his part would
                                solve the problem. Whereupon <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> turned to <persName>Cho</persName> and angrily
                                demanded that he take necessary action at once to correct situation.
                                    <persName>Cho</persName> seemed bewildered at nature and
                                intensity of <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s remarks. I
                                then informed President that under the circumstances I would not
                                object to <persName>Cho</persName>’s presence but hoped there would
                                be no repetition of the previous unfortunate incident. (<hi

                            <item>We then shifted to discussion of substance of my recent letter
                                (see <gloss target="#t_ref1">Ref</gloss> D) which was delivered to
                                him at 0830 10 Aug. I reiterated points covered in my letter,
                                particularly my determination to carry out my assigned
                                responsibilities under the armistice agreement. <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said he was surprised at some
                                of things said in that letter, particularly that he was “inspiring”
                                the demonstrations against the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. I corrected him by pointing out that my letter had
                                stated that the demonstrations were “government inspired”. He said
                                this was not so—they were the product of spontaneous popular
                                resentment against having “Czech and Polish spies” in <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. I told <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> that I hoped he did not consider that I was so
                                naive as to believe that demonstrations, of the size and intensity
                                of those occurring in five widely scattered places at the same time
                                were results of “spontaneous popular feelings” and furthermore I had
                                concrete evidence that they were not. He then changed the
                                subject.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>He next questioned reference in my letter to people being killed.
                                I told him that again he was misquoting from my letter and my
                                statement was that demonstrations were for “declared purpose of
                                killing, injuring or obtaining custody of persons whom this command
                                stands pledged under the Armistice Agreement to protect.” He
                                questioned accuracy of my quote which I verified by showing him a
                                copy of my letter which I had with me. I told him that mobs,
                                particularly at Pusan, by placard and voice, had so indicated such
                                intentions.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>He next questioned reference to “injuries to United States
                                military personnel”. He said that his information did not indicate
                                that people were being injured. I told him that he was misinformed
                                because a considerable number of United States personnel had in fact
                                been injured by stones, sticks and bottles thrown by the
                                demonstrators <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0173"/>and that
                                reports to that effect have been widely circulated and were common
                                knowledge. He repeated that he did not believe that there had been
                                any violence or destruction of property to date. I then cited the
                                example where two large trucks filled with demonstrators had crashed
                                through gates of Hialeah Compound at Pusan and that some personnel
                                aboard were armed with burp guns.</item>

                                injuries or damage to date he blandly and without warning justified
                                and rationalized everything he had just been denying by the
                                statement “but General, your American soldiers are protecting
                                Communist spies” and that “Koreans also had been injured”. I told
                                him that the Korean demonstrators had only themselves to blame for
                                any injuries they had received since they were aggressors.</item>
                            <label>8.</label>
                            <item><p>I then expressed my concern lest the present demonstrations get
                                    further out of control as the “deadline” of 2400 hours 13 Aug
                                    approached and more violence occur. Whereupon he shouted that he
                                    had given strict orders that there would be no violence. I told
                                    him that I was greatly relieved to hear it but that I had not
                                    been informed about such an order, and I was certain that it had
                                    not reached the local level at places where demonstrations were
                                    taking place. I urged that he insure that this be done soonest.
                                    He called loudly for his secretaries and asked if his orders for
                                    no violence had been published in the press. They told him that
                                    information on non-violence orders had already appeared in
                                    Korean language press but that there had not been sufficient
                                    time for them to appear in Korean English language papers. He
                                    directed them to expedite their publication in English.</p>

                                        had already done for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                        since World War II and particularly since 1950. I reviewed
                                        expenditures of thousands of lives and billions of dollars
                                        during Korean war and enumerated many programs currently
                                        underway, continuation of which was being jeopardized due to
                                        feeling being generated by current demonstrations. To my
                                        surprise <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> listened
                                        patiently to this review and at the conclusion admitted that
                                        America has indeed been Korea’s strongest friend and ally.
                                        “But why”, he asked, “do you continue to protect Communist
                                        spies in South Korea”.</item>

                                    >Rhee</persName> that he was issuing instructions that there
                                should be no violence and urged that his views in this regard be
                                immediately transmitted to responsible persons in areas where
                                demonstrations were taking place. Believing that it was time to
                                conclude the conference I made a move to leave but he asked me to
                                remain and discuss the most important issue of all, i.e., getting
                                the Communists to withdraw from Kaesong, Ongjin Peninsula and Han
                                River area south of 38 parallel. He spent 20 minutes reviewing
                                strategic importance of the area to <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> and reasons why Communists should leave. He urged

                                excited and spoke in a much louder tone of voice than usual. At
                                least once every ten minutes throughout entire conference he said he
                                felt that United States was embarking on a course of peaceful
                                coexistence with the Communists (among whom he included Russia,

                                times during the conference he kept repeating “no one understands

                            having to share the responsibility for such action. The U.S. would be
                            criticized in some circles for <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0180"
                            />having yielded, as it will appear, to pressure from the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and also for its failure to carry out a
                            provision of the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Course B has the advantage of greater acceptability to our Allies and, if
                            the Swiss and Swedes should decide to withdraw completely within two
                            months, it would be the most effective way to solve the problem in terms
                            of our public position. It has the disadvantage of prolonging the
                            Commission for perhaps two months and thus of renewed violence in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. It is doubtful whether the
                            Swiss and Swedes will give the desired assurance that they will withdraw
                            within two months, although the Swedes have indicated that this would in
                            fact be their intention.</p>
                        <p>Course C has the advantages of reasonableness as a public position,
                            probable acceptability to our Allies, and the virtual certainty of a
                            termination date for the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> since
                            compliance by the Communist side could be only at the impossible cost of
                            admitting continual violations. While there seems to be almost no
                            possibility of Communist compliance with the conditions set forth above,
                            there is the possibility that the Communist side may be able to make
                            gestures in the direction of compliance which would tend to obscure the
                            issue when the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> acted to terminate
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations in its area.</p>
                        <p>In adopting any one of the above courses it would be important to place
                            the full onus for the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> action on the
                            Communist side and the Communist members of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. As soon as a course is decided on and concurred in by
                            Defense, we should, therefore, make every effort, through our official
                            statements and through such media as <gloss target="#t_USIA1"
                                >USIA</gloss>, to establish the fact of Communist frustration and
                            obstruction of the Commission’s functions as evidenced in the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> record and by the fact of continued
                            Communist violation of the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>Action under any one of the above three courses almost certainly would
                            take place during or just before the General Assembly Session beginning
                            September 20. Consequently, it will be necessary to prepare as strong a
                            statement as possible to present to the Assembly of our reasons for
                            action. It will also be necessary to develop maximum support for our
                            position among the Sixteen and other members of the United Nations.</p>

                            Department of Defense clearance to Course “B” in the attached paper<note
                                n="2" xml:id="d82fn2">Not found attached. A note on the source text
                                indicates that the paper was the memorandum <ref target="#d81"><hi
                                        rend="italic">Supra</hi></ref>.</note> which had been
                            approved by the Secretary. I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gray</persName> that the Secretary had approved the proposal (a
                            copy of which had been informally sent to him previously) and that we
                            desired to have his concurrence so that we could move ahead with
                            implementing this policy.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> questioned some of the
                            language but, in the light of a previous conversation which I had had
                            with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, Vice Admiral Arthur C.
                            Davis, said that he would not make a point of insisting upon any
                            language changes— providing paragraph 3 of the proposal means that the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> will be given notice to
                            terminate its activities no later than October 15, 1955. Additionally,
                            he wished to be assured that the proposal was not contingent upon
                            agreement by the sixteen other countries and that the United States was
                            now prepared to move ahead unilaterally, if necessary. One additional
                            request which he wished to make was that the Swiss and Swedes be
                            informed of our desire that they endeavor to <pb n="154" xml:id="pg_154"
                                facs="0182"/>prevent any request being made by the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> for spot inspections in South Korea
                            before October 15.</p>
                        <p>I told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> that the date
                            October 15, 1955 did, in fact, represent the terminal date by which time
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> would terminate its activities
                            in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory. Secondly, although we
                            would inform The Sixteen of the action to be taken, the proposal was not
                            contingent upon concurrence by The Sixteen. Finally, I agreed that we
                            would endeavor to carry out the request regarding the prevention of spot
                            inspections but would, necessarily, have to make this in the form of a
                            suggestion rather than a request.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that he was satisfied
                            with these replies and was glad to give his concurrence. He felt that we
                            had come a long way to meet the wishes of the Department of Defense and
                            hoped that this troublesome problem would soon be ended.</p>

                                the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. The Embassy was
                                instructed to inform President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"

                                apparent duress. (Telegram 144 to Seoul, August 26; <hi

                            It would <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0183"/>be necessary, however,
                            for the Command to go on and say that it regards this step as a
                            temporary measure and that Communist frustration and obstruction had
                            made dissolution of the Commission the only satisfactory solution.</p>
                        <p>Both the Swiss and Swedes appreciated being kept informed and stated that
                            their Governments would be pleased to hear that this action was being
                            taken. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> was
                            appreciative of the manner in which the Swiss and Swedes had attempted
                            to carry out a difficult task at considerable expense and under
                            unpleasant circumstances.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Schnyder</persName> asked how it had been possible to
                            persuade Defense to accept the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> pointed
                            out that Defense still regarded the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> as a serious problem and that they had feared that
                            acceptance of the proposal at an earlier stage would have created
                            exactly the situation which recently developed in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. We had no intention, however, of
                            acting under duress and we felt the present situation to be most awkward
                            since we, like the Swiss, sympathize with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> in their attitude toward the Czechs and Poles. Mr.
                                <persName>Schnyder</persName> said that the Swiss did not expect
                            this situation to last forever and believed that Bern would feel it
                            easier to take the next move after reduction had been accomplished.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>von Sydow</persName> said that he hoped there would be no
                            more talk about abolition of the Commission until after (perhaps a week
                            or so) the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> proposal had been
                            accepted. He then asked about the general situation in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with respect to the demonstrations. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MCRJC1">McClurkin</persName> said that
                            following the firm action which we had taken things had quieted down
                            somewhat and that after the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            proposal has been accepted we will point out to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that continued demonstrations make
                            further action very difficult.</p>

                                <p>Your memorandum dated August 29 was appreciated. My reply has
                                    been delayed to permit a careful survey of public sentiment
                                    throughout the country to ascertain the consensus of opinion
                                    regarding cessation of the current demonstrations which the
                                    American Ambassador has indicated you desire.</p>
                                <p>We have found an overwhelming public demand for the continuance
                                    of peaceful, orderly demonstrations until there is positive
                                    assurance the critical situation will be remedied. The feeling
                                    is widespread that the security of the nation and the citizenry
                                    is in imminent danger and the people want the rest of the free
                                    world to know that their anxiety will not permit them to rest.
                                    They do not want to be caught unprepared as was the case five
                                    years ago.</p>
                                <p>We have received assurances that the demonstrators will adhere to
                                    the spirit of non-violence which is a long-established tradition
                                    in Korea. However no one can guarantee that the general public
                                    will always manage to restrain each participant’s actions under
                                    extreme provocation though every effort to this end will be
                                    made. But people alarmed over threats to their survival as a
                                    nation and as individuals are not always docile or good-natured
                                    and we hope an early solution will avert any possible mounting
                                    of tension.</p>
                                <p>On the whole, I have looked with sympathy on the manifestations
                                    of inward concern by the people over their future, and I believe
                                    the people in friendly nations are taking into consideration
                                    that their legitimate demands are their inalienable right.
                                    Protracted demonstrations might create, it is true, problems
                                    related to retaining the public’s spirit within bounds.</p>
                                <p>Our people had thought that by their demonstrations, they were
                                    rendering a service to the United States since Korea and the
                                    United <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0185"/>States have
                                    identical views and policies regarding democracy as opposed to
                                    Communism. The only force the demonstrators sought to exert was
                                    a moral force, a peaceful appeal to the world conscience. They
                                    were crestfallen and amazed to face American tanks and war
                                    weapons arranged against them to protect enemy spies whom you
                                    had promised more than a year ago to have removed. My people
                                    remember this promise, made in the presence of President
                                    Eisenhower and others, and it was expected that the United
                                    States would cooperate with us. As for the use of force, the
                                    idea had not entered the minds of the people of Korea. In spite
                                    of this, some officials and the press in the United States still
                                    insist on calling Koreans mobsters, rioters, and terrorists.
                                    This is not the way to calm the feelings of a wronged and
                                    wounded people.</p>
                                <p>I review these things in the hope that you will better understand
                                    our position and help others become aware of our good
                                    intentions.</p>
                                <p>I should add one point of utmost importance. In addition to the
                                    dissolution of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as
                                    soon as possible it is imperative that we regain possession of
                                    three strategic and vital areas of Korea south of the 38th
                                    parallel now occupied by our enemies without our consent or
                                    concurrence. This situation gives them a death grip on our
                                    throat and our people cannot rest in peace with destruction so
                                    threatening and ever-impending.</p>
                                <p>I deeply believe that even for the best interests of America’s
                                    honor and prestige the infamous armistice should be declared at
                                    an end. Such a step has full legal, moral and military basis.
                                    You are aware, I am sure, that Korea is no longer under any
                                    obligation with regard to the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                                <p>It is my conviction that if you stand firm on this point the
                                    Communists will accept it because they want to demonstrate their
                                    ‘sincerity’ in this ‘peace offensive’. Even if they should not,
                                    the United States has the absolute right to declare the
                                    Armistice null and void by reason of the Communist violations
                                    which began the day the document was signed and have continued
                                    with contemptuous boldness.</p>
                                <p>As for the implication that the Neutral Nations Supervisory
                                    Commission will not withdraw its members under ‘duress’, let me
                                    say we have nothing but respect for this sense of national
                                    honor. However, we ask our friends to compare the possible loss
                                    of our lives with the possible loss of face involved in
                                    retreating from an awkward situation, and I believe the matter
                                    will be seen in its proper perspective. Furthermore, if the
                                    truly neutral nations represented on the Commission view their
                                    passivity in the face of Czech and Polish betrayals of their
                                    task in the light of being an accessory after the fact, it will
                                    be admitted steps for immediate dissolution of the Neutral

                                    neutral members of the Commission are duly sensitive to the
                                    ignominious treatment they have suffered so long from thousands
                                    of their Communist colleagues, they should rather draw moral
                                    support from public manifestations of indignation instead of
                                    being tempted to construe them as an intended ‘duress’. Failure
                                    to act will mean greater dishonor while heeding to the just
                                    demands of my wronged people will go toward reestablishing honor
                                    and dignity which cannot stand divorced from justice.</p>

                                <p>In the final analysis, publishers who acquaint their readers with
                                    their views are doing a civic duty and a praiseworthy one, yet
                                    few persons regard the resulting editorials as a form of duress.
                                    The man on the street who writes a letter which appears in a

                                    themselves it seems prejudicial to brand such action as

                            each compound were typical of demonstrations during last 2 weeks. A
                            group of demonstrators is usually relieved as a unit and replaced by
                            another group of similar size. Groups stay in position from 2 to 8 hours
                            during daylight and early evening hours. Small groups of 30 to 50
                            demonstrators occasionally remain near the gates throughout the night.
                            Frequently no demonstrators are present during hours of darkness.
                            Activity usually consists of singing songs or following directions of
                            leaders chanting in unison “Czech and Polish spies must go”, etc.</p>

                            him that I did not agree with many of the things he had said and
                            reiterated the importance of stopping demonstrations if the <gloss

                        <p>6. I then told President that aside from demonstrations making it more
                            difficult for <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> to solve <gloss
                                target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss> problem, there were certain features
                            of demonstrations that were extremely objectionable to me, as follows: <list>

                                <item>They made it necessary for me to divert valuable US forces
                                    from the main battle position and from their primary mission of

                                <label>b.</label>
                                <item>From psychological point of view it was regrettable and, in my
                                    opinion poor taste, for school children to be participating in
                                    the demonstrations. I told him that they were not only losing
                                    valuable <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0189"/>school time
                                    but their participation would inevitably arouse antagonisms in
                                    their minds against US forces who had only recently saved them
                                    and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> from Communist

                                <item>With regard to his statement that “We have found an
                                    overwhelming public demand for continuance of the
                                    demonstrations,” I told him it evident that my information
                                    indicated quite the contrary; that they were directed
                                    demonstrations in which laborers, farmers and school children
                                    were forced to participate or provide funds to support them. I
                                    told him that families in Pusan, Kunsan and Inchon were required
                                    to provide a member to participate in the demonstrations
                                    frequently or pay 100 hwan to hire someone to represent them. I
                                    cited the case of an American supported orphanage which, on
                                    being unable to provide personnel to participate in
                                    demonstrations, had been assessed 500 hwan to support
                                    demonstrations. When money could not be produced, the canvassers
                                    kicked a hole in the door of the orphanage. Upon hearing of this
                                    incident, President became very angry and demanded that he be
                                    provided with detailed information so that he might take
                                    corrective action. I told him that for me to reveal names and
                                    places would only result in retaliatory attacks against
                                    individuals and agencies concerned, but I was certain that if he
                                    desired, he had ample means to obtain the same information as I
                                    had.</item>

                                <item>I told the President that in flying over demonstration areas,
                                    I observed that demonstrators were being hauled back and forth
                                    from adjacent villages and cities by trucks and buses. I
                                    regarded this use of scarce motor transportation and consumption
                                    of large quantities of fuel for such purposes to be extremely
                                    wasteful and totally unjustified particularly when <gloss
                                        target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> was requesting, and US was
                                    providing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with, motor
                                    vehicles and <gloss target="#t_POL1">POL</gloss> under current
                                    aid programs. Again President became angry and said that he
                                    would promptly put a stop to such use of transportation.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>7. Recent intelligence reports indicate that at <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s direction instructions have now
                            been issued by <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government to stop
                            use of motor transportation in connection with demonstrations. This was
                            confirmed in a conversation I had with General <persName
                                corresp="#p_CIIK1">Chung II Kwon</persName>, Chief of Staff of the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army, who is presently in Japan
                            visiting US logistical installations. He informed me that the
                            instructions were issued by the President early this week before
                                <persName>Chung</persName> departed from Seoul. If these
                            instructions are strictly enforced, it will become increasingly
                            difficult for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to maintain present
                            scale of demonstrations since participants will be required to walk long
                            distances to reach demonstration areas. Use of motor transportation to
                            move demonstrators will be checked frequently by compound commanders. If
                            demonstrations continue or if instructions on use of motor
                            transportation are not enforced, I shall again bring the matter to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s attention on my
                            next trip to Korea.</p>
                        <p>8. The foregoing is submitted for information purposes and as background
                            against which to view the present situation in Korea.</p>

                            that they find themselves unable to abandon their proposal to make
                            reductions in their forces in Korea. However, they have modified their
                            original plans to retain only a battalion group and will now retain a
                            Brigade Headquarters with a force of all arms under command, including

                            to come in on such short notice because he felt the question which he

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> wanted to tell Minister

                            anti-American atmosphere being created in Korea. We seemed unable to do

                            concerned and we were criticized on every hand. This criticism which has

                            the way to get results. The things which have been said, however, are
                            extremely distasteful to us and we feel that this constant criticism of
                            the U.S. is poisoning our relations and certainly is counterproductive.
                            We have been accused of being soft toward Communism, and yet we came to
                            Korea’s aid at considerable loss of American lives to save Korea from
                            Communism. We have been charged with intent to wreck the Korean economy
                            and yet we are expending hundreds of millions of dollars to aid the
                            economy.</p>
                        <p>While not intending to go into detail on these matters, Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> wanted the Minister to understand that
                            he was speaking frankly and out of genuine concern for Korea when he
                            said that the poisoning of American-Korean relations was self-defeating.
                            When Minister <persName>Han</persName> pressed for details, Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> said that the Office of Northeast Asian
                            Affairs would be glad to present them to Minister
                                <persName>Han</persName> later on this week. He did wish, however,
                            to give Minister <persName>Han</persName> one example of the dangers in
                            the situation. Recently, he had occasion to see a letter received in the
                            Department from Dr. <persName>Milton Eisenhower</persName>.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d88fn2">Not found in Department of State files.</note> Dr.
                                <persName>Eisenhower</persName> had stated that reports reflecting
                            American-Korean <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0192"/>relations had
                            shown such animus against the U.S. he wondered if it would not be better
                            if he resigned from the American-Korean Foundation, as he was doubtful
                            he could be of any further service. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName>
                            recommended that he not resign from the American-Korean Foundation but
                            that he remain in his present position in the hope that we could
                            persuade our Korean friends of the great mistake in their public
                            attitude toward the U.S.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Han</persName> was genuinely moved by Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName>’s reference to Dr.
                                <persName>Eisenhower</persName>’s letter and expressed hope that Dr.
                                <persName>Eisenhower</persName> would not resign from the
                            American-Korean Foundation. He argued, however, that there was no
                            anti-Americanism being created in Korea, that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was firmly pro-American, and that
                            any statements which might have been made merely expressed legitimate
                            differences of opinion. The only recent problems which Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> might have reference to, he thought,
                            were those associated with the demonstrations against the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and the current dispute over taxation
                            of American businessmen.<note n="3" xml:id="d88fn3">Extensive

                                is in Department of State, Central File 895B.11.</note> On the first
                            count, he argued that the feelings of the people were so strong about
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> that the demonstrations could
                            not be helped. As far as the tax dispute was concerned, there were, he
                            thought, legitimate differences in view. Minister
                                <persName>Han</persName> said he talked with <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                >ICA</gloss> people a few weeks ago and they expressed great
                            satisfaction with the improved atmosphere in Korea following the
                            economic negotiations in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> again stated he did not wish to discuss
                            details and that he was describing an atmosphere—a trend—which gave us
                            deep concern. He asked that the Minister reflect on the matter and hoped
                            he would faithfully report to his Government the concern of Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, himself, and their
                            staff. He expressed the hope that there would be some reversal in this
                            trend.</p>

                                responded that, according to his information, the Communist members

                            The Swedes are cooperative with us. They are proposing to move people to
                            the demilitarized zones. The Swedes think there is a good chance of
                            doing it. We can’t allow our military people to step in this way. R.
                            referred to an August memo<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2"><ref target="#d81"

                            The Sec. said he better reverse himself if that memo is right. R. said

                        <p>At large luncheon October 7, I was guest of Yi Ki-bung, Speaker National
                            Assembly, who probably frankest confidant of <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>. After prior consultation with <persName
                                corresp="#p_LWSB1">Lacy</persName> I told <persName>Yi</persName>
                            that I had been most impressed with courteous and sympathetic meeting
                            with President but had been deeply shocked few minutes after leaving him
                            to read excoriating and inflammatory articles in latest editions
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s own newspaper including
                            provocative editorials against US. I said it was most difficult for me
                            to reconcile conflicting attitudes.</p>
                        <p><persName>Yi</persName> appeared greatly worried and we pursued subject
                            no further.</p>
                        <p><persName>Yi</persName> then read speech obviously written for him by
                            someone in <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s immediate
                            entourage complaining that US must change its “weak and vacillating
                            policy of coexistence with Communist bloc.” In brief reply I merely said
                            I was glad have opportunity visit Korea and exchange views with
                            government leaders and that we had come only to learn and listen not to
                            carry on negotiations. I then proposed a toast to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> after which Speaker <persName
                                corresp="#p_YK1">Yi</persName> hurriedly rose and proposed a
                            somewhat embarrassed response to President Eisenhower.</p>

                        <p>Later in the afternoon I attended heartening briefing by <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> General Staff on their defense
                            organization. At conclusion Army Chief of Staff General Chong addressed
                            me directly in presence of entire group saying that Korean Army
                            remembers that we trained together, fought together and died together.
                            This produces strong and lasting bond between us. We look to US for
                            guidance and advice. We pledge to US complete loyalty and cooperation of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military establishment.</p>
                        <p>I replied that we were all deeply moved by this presentation; that they
                            could rely upon our support and cooperation and that American people
                            have highest admiration for what <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Army has achieved and for its courage.</p>
                        <p>At that time we felt this had no greater significance than exchange
                            amenities. Later in evening, however, Chong told

                            Swiss and Swedes had been the first to propose abolition of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. They wanted very much to get out of
                            this unpleasant task and failing to get agreement to terminate the
                            Commission they had proposed the recent reduction as a first step. We
                            had been four months in accepting the proposal for a reduction because
                            General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> had felt that
                            such a reduction would not settle the problem.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis said that both Defense and the Command had feared that if
                            they accepted the proposed reduction it would be the last step
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the Swedes were
                            earnest about getting out of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            and that they did not regard the recent reduction as a last <pb n="172"
                                xml:id="pg_172" facs="0200"/>step. The Commission was a drain on
                            them and their problem was to get out as gracefully as possible in view
                            of their neutral position.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that both
                            the Swiss and Swedes had diplomatic relations with the Chinese
                            Communists and did not want to jeopardize those relations by too hasty
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            when we had finally gone along with the proposed reduction we had sent a
                            note to the Swiss and Swedes expressing the hope that an additional step
                            might be taken by October 15.<note n="3" xml:id="d93fn3">Summarized in
                                    <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> The Swiss had taken
                            umbrage at the October 15 date and Swedish Ambassador Boheman had told
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> confidentially that
                            the Swiss felt that October 15 smacked too much of an ultimatum.
                            Ambassador Boheman had informed us that the Swedes were engaged right
                            now trying to persuade the Communists at Panmunjom to agree to withdraw
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams to the Demilitarized
                            Zone. They, of course, did not want to withdraw from the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> under duress by either the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> or the U.S. If the Swedes do manage to
                            get the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> to agree to withdraw to
                            the Demilitarized Zone it will be the best possible way of accomplishing
                            our objective.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis asked whether the Swiss would go along.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said they also
                            wanted out. He had already told them in as strong diplomatic terms as
                            possible of our need to have something done soon. The Swedes feel they
                            can work the matter out with the Swiss and the Communists, given a
                            little time. The Swiss and Swedes are not dragging their feet on the
                            matter; the only question with them is the matter of tactics.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis pointed out that the more time that passed the greater the
                            risk of recurring riots in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. He
                            wondered whether the October 15 date had leaked to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. He pointed out that he had understood
                            the October 15 date was also the position the Secretary regarded as
                            favorable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the Secretary had
                            not felt the date was that categorical, but rather looked at it as a
                            target date.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said there was no
                            question but what the language of the agreement between State and
                            Defense was airtight on the question of the October 15 date. However,
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had talked with the
                            Secretary and the Secretary had stated his intention to write a letter
                            to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> saying that
                            we ought not to regard this date as too firm, but rather give the Swiss
                            and Swedes a little more time to carry out their desired course of
                            action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that the
                            Australians were worried about the possibility of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command taking unilateral action.</p>
                        <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0201"/>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that this
                            worry was principally fear that such action would place us in a bad
                            public position, one where we might be made to look like violators of
                            the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>
                            had agreed that a reasonable delay would be all right and asked how much
                            time the Swiss and Swedes would take to complete their action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that on the
                            basis of his conversations with Ambassador Boheman it was hard to pick
                            out a particular date. The Swedes had made a proposition to the
                            Communists to withdraw the teams to the Demilitarized Zone. The
                            Communists were finding this proposal difficult to turn down and the
                            Swedes were pressing hard hoping to get a reasonably prompt response.
                            Ambassador Boheman had informed us that if the Swedes were not able to
                            get such a response by October 15 the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command could, of course, ask the Swiss and Swedes to get out and they
                            would go. However, this would place the Command in the possible position
                            of violating the Armistice.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis asked if the Swedes might not prefer to be moved out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that the
                            Swiss would like very much to have us tell them to get out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the Swedes
                            would not mind being moved out but then we would have to bear the onus
                            of such action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed with the point
                            Admiral Davis made that there now was somewhat of a lull in the
                            demonstrations in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and that this
                            was the time to act.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said he had appealed to Minister
                                <persName>Han</persName> very strongly on this matter pointing out
                            that the demonstrations had tied our hands and made it difficult for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command or the Swiss and Swedes to
                                act.<note n="4" xml:id="d93fn4">See <ref target="#d88">Document

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> how the matter had been left
                            with Ambassador Boheman.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he had
                            told the Ambassador that October 15 was not an ultimatum. However, there
                            had to be a termination of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> at
                            some time and the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command had felt
                            that they wanted to know by October 15 what the Swiss and Swedes were
                            going to do if anything so that they could act accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis asked why the Communists should agree to withdrawal of the
                            teams to the Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said Ambassador
                            Boheman felt that the Communists were fearful the Swiss and Swedes would
                            walk out altogether; they wanted very much to maintain the facade of
                            inspection. Thus they might settle for something rather than
                            nothing.</p>
                        <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0202"/>
                        <p>Admiral Davis said he thought we should take this occasion to tell the
                            Swiss and Swedes that there was a comparative lull in the demonstrations
                            in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and that there was a certain
                            awareness in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations there should be wound up
                            shortly, and thus if we do not manage this soon, we will find ourselves
                            in a very difficult position again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he would tell
                            the Swiss this when they came in to report Bern’s attitude on the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis said that he presumed whatever is done State will simply
                            inform the Sixteen and not ask their permission to take action.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that this was so, but
                            pointed out that if we were forced into unilateral <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command action our position with our
                            Allies would be very bad.</p>
                        <p>Admiral Davis said Defense could not accept the responsibility of having
                            the demonstrations build up again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said it was hard to
                            tell what the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will do, and said that
                            what we should try to do now was to smoke out the Swiss.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> asked whether the Command should not be
                            notified.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he
                            understood the Command did not have instructions to take action. He
                            thought, however, it would be well to inform the Command in a joint

                            force of twenty active and ten reserve divisions, and recommends a
                            stage-by-stage cut-back, reviewed every six months. The tentative force
                            levels he recommends are: July 1957, twenty active, ten reserve (as at
                            present); January 1958, seventeen active, thirteen reserve; July 1958,
                            thirteen active, seventeen reserve; January 1959, nine active,
                            twenty-one reserve. He says that he requires a lead time of eighteen
                            months to retire a group of divisions, allowing time for locating a site

                            tentative schedule and approval of the necessary construction funds so

                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> has in mind
                            notifying the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> about next

                        <p>The Agreed Minute of Understanding of November 1954 states that “…<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d96fn3">Ellipsis in the source text.</note> as trained
                            reserve strengths are obtained, the total number of active military
                            personnel will be adjusted accordingly.” In negotiating the Agreed
                            Minute it was made clear to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> that
                            the United States believed the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> had
                            neither the manpower nor economic resources to support its present armed
                            forces indefinitely. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName>’s recommendation is moderate in terms of its
                            timing and is in line with the Agreed Minute. The only real difficulty
                            that I can see at this time is the furor which will be created in the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> on announcement of such plans
                            despite their signature of the Agreed Minute.</p>

                                November 2 memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs
                                of Staff noted that they had approved in principle a future
                                reduction in active <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army forces,
                                but they did not specifically approve the final number of divisions
                                and did not specify the date at which the reduction would be
                                feasible. The Joint Chiefs concluded that conditions in Korea
                                remained sufficiently tense so that “any reduction of forces at this
                                time could cause a deterioration of the Far East situation which
                                would be detrimental to U.S. interest in that area.” (Washington

                            not yet called upon for our views. My preliminary thought is to concur
                            in these recommendations but to examine carefully the timing and methods
                            of informing the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Probably it would
                            be best to approach the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> only on the
                            first stage of the reduction and to do so at the working level where an
                            examination would be made of the manpower resources of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and the status of the reserve program
                            on the assumption that the Agreed Minute establishes the general

                                October 27–November 6, 1955.</note> and feel impelled to record my
                            views at this time, inasmuch as I shall be away from Washington for
                            perhaps two weeks or more.</p>
                        <p>More than two months have elapsed since our August 24 agreement, and we
                            find the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command, currently facing
                            more exasperating problems caused by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> than he has faced at almost any time during the
                            Armistice. The Department of Defense for the past two years has been
                            patient while diplomatic efforts were being made to solve the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem. I appreciate the political
                            aspects of the problem, but political efforts directed towards it have
                            not achieved the desired results.</p>
                        <p>I feel strongly that we should not share in responsibility for the
                            predictable results of indefinite delay: Pressure for action by the
                            Koreans by resumption of violent demonstrations while we are unable or
                            unwilling to take action under such pressure.</p>
                        <p>Although I agreed to an extension of time beyond our agreed deadline of
                            October 15 to permit the Swiss and the Swedes more time to take their
                            second step, I do not believe I can conscientiously permit our agreed
                            deadline to extend indefinitely. It is, therefore, urgently requested
                            that steps be taken by the Department of State to permit the Department
                            of Defense to instruct the Commander-in-Chief, United Nations Command,
                            to remove the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams to the
                            Demilitarized Zone on November 21, unless the purpose has been
                            accomplished by other means in the meantime.</p>

                            <item>President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s age is
                                beginning to tell and at times he appears irrational and
                                irresponsible. There is a possibility that as their terms expire he
                                might gradually replace the present military leaders with men who
                                are willing to do his bidding and then take some rash action. There
                                is no evidence, however, that he is preparing to do so. In my
                                opinion, <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is fully aware
                                of his complete dependence upon the United States, economically and
                                militarily, and that despite his sword rattling from time to time he
                                will not risk losing our support by unilateral action of a serious
                                nature. This has been my conviction since my talks with him in
                                June–July, 1953. During one of his most belligerent periods, the
                                Secretary protested what seemed to us to be a particularly rash
                                statement. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> replied, with

                                clear that he cannot act over the objections of his commanders and
                                that his present commanders will continue to refuse. With respect to
                                the possibility of fabricating an incident as justification for a
                                military move, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military is
                                probably in position to prevent this, and our Eighth Army is very
                                much on top of the situation. However, there can be no absolute

                                    “dreadful fight” over the lines of authority in the South Korean
                                    Army and that <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had
                                    again complained of the Army’s unwillingness to drive North

                                        <persName>Chung</persName> was discouraged by his exchange
                                    with <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, and he repeated
                                    that the United States could always count on the loyalty of the

                                whether something might soon happen which would cause him to
                                conclude, along with others, that it was necessary to remove the
                                President from active office. This would be contrary to
                                    <persName>Chung</persName>’s expressed belief in constitutional
                                processes but could conceivably come about because the President
                                created a military incident or threatened to do so, because his
                                interference in Army matters became unacceptable, because the
                                President threatened to remove his present commanders from power, or
                                because of a general conviction that the President had ceased to be
                                able to govern effectively. Any such action by General <persName

                        <p>1. Communist subversion in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is a
                            potential threat rather than an immediate danger. There are no known
                            organized subversive forces or activities. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Government and its people are strongly anti-Communist.
                            Non-Communist opposition to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Administration is weak in number and its capabilities are limited by
                            internal disunity and the strict watchfulness of the Government.</p>
                        <p>2. However, there are limited potential Communist subversive assets in
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> which under certain conditions
                            might be exploited and developed. These include: remnants of the former
                            Communist underground in South Korea; other Communists and Communist
                            sympathizers who survived the Korean war in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>; relatives and associates of the thousands of Leftist
                            intellectuals who fled to North Korea during the war; approximately 2
                            million refugees from North Korea now in South Korea who, although
                            mostly non-Communists, are potentially exploitable because of their
                            friends and relatives in North Korea; prisoners-of-war released by the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in South Korea; and some
                            dissatisfaction with the authoritarian regime and with the economic
                            situation.</p>
                        <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0211"/>
                        <p>3. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Administration has firm
                            internal control over both civil and military activities, but it is in
                            effect authoritarian and corrupt by Western standards. Because of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s dominant role,
                            his death or incapacitation might result, although not necessarily, in a
                            period of confusion and chaos. Furthermore, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> economic situation is precarious and the economy is
                            largely dependent upon substantial aid from the U.S. Should this
                            economic situation deteriorate substantially, or should a chaotic
                            political situation develop, the Communists might be able to exploit
                            their potential assets for subversion.</p>
                        <p>4. Externally, the threat to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government is the proximity of the north Korean and Chinese Communists
                            and to a lesser extent the Communist-influenced Koreans in Japan.
                            Available evidence indicates that Communist infiltration through the
                            well-guarded Demilitarized Zone is limited at present to low-level
                            espionage and possibly to the smuggling of funds. Agents, funds,
                            supplies and direction may be infiltrated via coastal smuggling and it
                            is also possible that high-level agents, whose mission is political
                            subversion, may come into South Korea through devious routes (via China
                            and Japan). There is, however, little evidence that these channels are
                            being utilized for subversive operations at the present time. Of the
                            600,000 Koreans in Japan, 400,000 are believed to be sympathetic to the
                            General Federation of Koreans Resident in Japan (Soren), a Korean
                            Communist front group. About 10,000 of these are considered to be
                            hardcore Communists. To some extent the smuggling activities of the
                            members of Soren provide funds for Communist operations and channels for
                            courier use.</p>

                            serves to generate active opposition to Communism internally. Thus
                            unless there is a serious internal deterioration in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> for other reasons, this external threat
                            does not add to the danger of subversion.</p>
                        <p>19. Circumstances could arise in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>,
                            however, that might permit the development of a serious internal
                            Communist threat. Such circumstances would include (a) political
                            struggle over the succession to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>, (b) substantial economic deterioration, (c) in the
                            long range, serious deterioration of public confidence in the
                            effectiveness of the administration. Even in these circumstances,
                            however, Communist exploitation could not immediately create a serious
                            internal <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0212"/>threat and some time
                            would be required for the Communists to build up their strength and
                            influence.</p>
                        <p>20. If confronted with a serious internal Communist threat, the internal
                            security agencies could be expected to devote greater attention to the
                            problem. Whether they would be able to cope adequately with a serious
                            threat is questionable in view of their inefficiency and lack of
                            training; in which case the armed forces—which are designed to enable
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to resist external aggression as
                            well as maintain internal security—would be more than adequate to
                            maintain internal security.</p>
                        <p>[Here follows an inventory of existing U.S. assistance programs bearing
                            on the internal security problem.]</p>
                        <p rend="center">V. Political Factors</p>
                        <p>27. As a consequence of the experience with the Communist aggression of
                            1950, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government, political
                            leadership, and populace are intensely anti-Communist. Thus the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government is thoroughly aware of the
                            potential danger of Communist subversion, and would be receptive to aid
                            from the U.S. in the internal security field. However, it would urge
                            that the aid be in form of equipment and possibly financial subsidies
                            for the existing internal security organizations and would insist upon
                            full control of all such aid. Diversion of presently programmed economic
                            and military aid to strengthen the internal security program would
                            surely be opposed strongly by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                            >ROK</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>28. Political activity in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is
                            characterized by conspiratorial tactics. This is a consequence of the
                            revolutionary background of the political leaders, the immaturity of the
                            parties and democratic procedures, and police-state practices of the
                            administration. False allegations of secret alliance with the Communists
                            have often been made by one group against another for political
                            reasons.</p>
                        <p>29. The system of competing internal security organizations is reflected
                            in the conspiratorial character of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            politics. Competition among the agencies serves to prevent Communist
                            infiltration of any one of them or of political factions identified with
                            any one of them and serves also to restrain the tendency to use false
                            allegations. A case in point is the current “seditious documents” case,
                            in which one group of agencies made public the efforts of the JPMGC to
                            deliver Communist documents to Assembly members, allegedly to test them
                            but possibly to trump up charges against them. Although the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has from time to time made moves toward
                            coordinating the internal security agencies, thus far these efforts have
                            not produced significant improvements. It is doubtful that in the
                            present situation the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government
                            will make genuine efforts to reorganize the individual <pb n="185"
                                xml:id="pg_185" facs="0213"/>internal security agencies or to unite
                            or coordinate their activities closely.</p>
                        <p>30. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government almost certainly
                            will continue to rely on several competing internal security
                            organizations. The police, who now conduct most routine Communist
                            investigations and could serve as the main anti-Communist agency, might
                            be given increased responsibilities if the U.S. pressed for it, but
                            military agencies probably could not be precluded from broad roles in
                            non-military investigations. In time of serious internal emergency, the
                            military investigative agencies almost certainly would exercise greater
                            authority and wider responsibilities than the police.</p>
                        <p>31. Because of the political considerations, U.S. aid in the internal
                            security field in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> probably will
                            have to stress the development of an effective security leadership
                            through training in the existing organizations. It seems unlikely that
                            it could be used as a lever to effect a reorganization for closer
                            coordination of the existing agencies.</p>

                        <p>32. The threat of Communist subversion in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> is at present a potential rather than an actual danger.
                            Unless a chaotic political situation develops, or economic conditions
                            deteriorate, the limited Communist assets (internal and external) are
                            not likely to become effective instruments of subversion.</p>

                        <p>On November 22, the First Committee of the U.N. General Assembly
                            completed 11 days of debate on “the Korean question” and drew up a
                            report for submission to the General Assembly. The debate was based in
                            part upon the annual report of the U.N. Commission for the Unification
                            and Rehabilitation of Korea which was submitted on September 7 and
                            covered the period from August 17, 1954, to September 7, 1955. (U.N.
                            doc. A/2947) The debate also ranged over the problem of the former
                            prisoners of the Korean war, which India, as chairman of the Neutral
                            Nations Repatriation Commission, was eager to resolve. In addition, the
                            debate included a sharp exchange between the Polish Representative, J.
                            Katz-Suchy, and Jacob Blaustein of the U.S. Delegation on the question
                            of which <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0215"/>of the contending
                            sides in the Korean conflict were violating the letter and spirit of the

                            Nations Supervisory Commission. First Committee debate on the Korean
                            question is recorded in U.N. docs. A/C.1/S.R.783 through A/C.1/S.R.793.

                            to our telephone conversation yesterday afternoon on this exceedingly
                            difficult question. We greatly appreciate your patience and your
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>The only justification for a postponement of the action you recommend is
                            our earnest belief that we should avoid the appearance of acting
                            unilaterally if it is at all possible to achieve our objective in some
                            other way. As you know, the Czechs and Poles have rejected the Swiss and
                            Swedish proposal to move their teams to the Demilitarized Zone, but
                            Ambassador Boheman of Sweden came to see me a few days ago<note n="3"

                            me very confidentially that Sweden had indicated <pb n="188"
                                xml:id="pg_188" facs="0216"/>to the Chinese Communists in Peiping
                            that it did not see how it could otherwise continue its membership on
                            the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. He said that his Government
                            was endeavoring to persuade the Swiss to adopt the same position. There
                            is at this time, therefore, a possibility that our purpose can be
                            accomplished through negotiation and the Department of State believes
                            that the Swiss and Swedes should be given the opportunity to complete
                            their negotiations. While it has been two months since we agreed to a
                            reduction in the teams, we delayed four months in giving our approval. I
                            am convinced that both the Swedes and Swiss are actively endeavoring to
                            use all of the bargaining leverage that they have in trying to persuade
                            the Czechs and Poles to agree to eliminate the stationary teams.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State also believes it would be highly undesirable for
                            the United States to take unilateral action on the Neutral Nations
                            Supervisory Commission issue while the United Nations General Assembly
                            is still in session. Such timing would provoke general debate in which a
                            great many nations, other than the Communist nations, would in all
                            probability severely criticize the United States action and would damage
                            the general conduct of United States efforts in the General Assembly. On
                            the other hand, we have used the opportunity afforded by a speech by the
                            Polish representative which had numerous misrepresentations about the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and have replied at some length,
                            setting the record straight.<note n="4" xml:id="d101fn4">See the

                            therefore, that we agree to set January 1, 1956 as a deadline for action

                        <p>15. Continued violation of the reinforcing restrictions of the Armistice
                            has resulted in a substantial strengthening of the relative Communist
                            military potential, particularly with respect to the introduction of
                            more and newer weapons and the development of an air force based in
                            Korea of 300 to 400 planes, most of which are jet fighters. The <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command is in a precarious situation and
                            it may be necessary within the next year to declare that in view of
                            Communist violations and of the responsibility of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command to “insure the stability of the
                            Military Armistice”, the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command will
                            replace old and worn out weapons with such new weapons and in such
                            quantity as it may deem necessary to maintain the relative military
                            strength of the two sides as envisaged under the Armistice Agreement.
                            Such a step will require considerable diplomatic efforts with our
                            Allies—who have already been partially prepared—if we are to have their
                            support and we will have to state the military requirements frankly.</p>

                        <p>16. As stated in paragraph 2. above, efforts toward a satisfactory
                            solution of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem
                            continue.</p>

                        <p>17. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s willingness to
                            strain U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations both by
                            threats of unilateral military action and by general intransigeance will
                            continue to present problems.</p>
                        <p>18. During the coming year, it is entirely possible that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> may die or become
                            disabled. Possibilities for an orderly succession are fairly good, but
                            the situation could become chaotic. Much may depend on who is elected
                            Vice President in the elections to be held sometime in 1956. It is also
                            possible that progressive deterioration in <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s alertness and judgment and fear of possible
                            developments could induce persons now close to the President to attempt
                            to seize power. The attitude of the U.S. in such eventuality would
                            probably be decisive.</p>
                        <p>19. In view of the gradual exodus from Korea of the forces of various of
                            the 16 nations, more positive efforts should be taken than heretofore in
                            an effort to persuade the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to broaden
                            its representation and to persuade other countries to recognize it.
                            Relations between Japan and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will
                            continue to present serious problems for the U.S. It continues to seem
                            advisable, however, for the U.S. to refrain from active intervention but
                            to be available should both parties request our good offices and should
                            there appear real possibilities of settling issues.</p>

                            the U.S. economic aid program. These issues again will include the
                            exchange rate (including the pricing of aid goods into the Korean
                            economy), utilization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s own

                                visited Korea, October 27–November 7, to inspect the economic aid
                                programs in Korea.</note> I particularly enjoyed and learned much
                            from the many penetrating and thought provoking conversations which I
                            was able to have with you. I have found that my experience in Korea has
                            been exceedingly helpful since my return to Washington as I participated
                            with our many colleagues in the Department and <gloss target="#t_ICA1"
                                >ICA</gloss> in many difficult decisions which have been made during
                            the last month.</p>
                        <p>I have talked to many people, including Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, Bob McClurkin and others, about the
                            difficulties which our longer term position in Korea seems to hold. As a
                            result of these conversations, I am still convinced that thought
                            provoking analyses from the Embassy could serve highly useful purposes
                            within the Department. Of course you know the question of current
                            consideration of any reduction in the arm [<hi rend="italic">armed</hi>]
                            strength of the Republic of Korea, even when considered in relation to
                            economic development or economic stabilization objectives, is out of the
                            question at the present time. I know from conversations with Turner
                                <persName>Cameron</persName> that the Embassy is strongly opposed to
                            such action partly because of the internal political implementations
                                [<hi rend="italic">implications</hi>?] that even such a rumor could
                            have. Over and above this, as you are aware, there are overriding
                            factors in the total Far East position of the United States. There is
                            concern here, however, and this has been expressed by almost all the
                            members of Under Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                            >Hoover</persName>’s party as a result of their visit to Korea, with the
                            question of the success of our current economic program in Korea.
                            Members of the <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> party,
                            particularly Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HJB1">Hollister</persName> and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>,<note n="4"

                                    Prochnow</persName>, Deputy Under Secretary of State for

                            study team to Korea to appraise and make recommendations for improving
                            the nature and implementation of our economic aid program. Perhaps
                            unfortunately, and certainly unwittingly, I added some fuel to this fire
                            when I reported to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            that I had observed two somewhat disturbing factors in the Korean
                            situation. First, I mentioned an apparent lack of conviction on the part
                            of both Americans and Koreans <pb n="192" xml:id="pg_192" facs="0220"
                            />that it is completely possible to achieve a viable economy in South
                            Korea. My purpose in mentioning this point was to demonstrate the need
                            for increased incentive, particularly among the Koreans, to work harder
                            toward maximizing the benefits that can be derived from our aid program
                            in Korea. Secondly, I alluded to the fear, which I had expressed both to
                            you and Ty Wood, that there is a need for more adequate understanding of
                            the more or less specific project lines which should be followed in
                            further development of the industrial sector in Korea. I, of course,
                            indicated that a large share of responsibility in this field has been
                            assumed by <gloss target="#t_UNKRA1">UNKRA</gloss> and that their
                            performances have not been particularly exemplary. I also indicated that
                            there is a conscious awareness of the need for getting on top of the
                            planning aspects of the industrial sector not only in the Embassy and
                                <gloss target="#t_OEC1">OEC</gloss>, but also on the part of several
                            Koreans with whom I talked; I certainly did not talk to the Koreans in
                            these terms, but the questions raised by <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1"

                                >Apparent reference to Chong Kyu-man, head of the Machinery Section

                            indicated a deep probing on their part. I further indicated that recent
                            high caliber additions to Ty’s staff will expedite the handling of the
                            planning task by <gloss target="#t_OEC1">OEC</gloss>. Bob has been
                            arguing with his usual expert-ness that now is not the time for
                            something which the Koreans might think is “just another survey”.
                            Instead, if there is to be a study it should be arranged in such a
                            manner that there is full participation by competent Koreans. This would
                            mean, for the first time, the development of an end-product which the
                            Koreans could feel was their own and should provide an incentive for the
                            Koreans using the product of such a study rather than merely providing
                            another “dust catcher”.</p>
                        <p>We feared for a while that it would not be possible to get action on Ty’s
                            request for additional funds for Korea for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1956 until some survey mission had been able to write a
                            report. Fortunately, it looks as though our fears were unfounded since
                            it is probable that an additional $25 million will be made available in
                            the near future with the consensus that the situation will be further
                            reviewed about March 56 with a view to determining the desirability of
                            extending an additional $25 million at that time. This may be your first
                            knowledge of this possibility. I would suggest that you handle the
                            information very carefully since the decision is still not quite final.

                            ago the Swedish Government had instructed its envoys in Prague and
                            Warsaw to tell the Czech and Polish Governments that the only condition

                        <p>At its 269th meeting on December 8 the National Security Council
                            discussed the problems posed for the economy of the Republic of Korea by
                            the inflationary pressures created by a large military establishment
                            supported by American aid. The consensus of the members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> was that while the South Korean economy
                            was not strong enough to support the military forces which the South
                            Korean Government considered necessary, it would not do to urge a sudden
                            reduction in the level of South Korean military forces. As Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> put it: “Sudden action
                            of this sort might well break the morale of South Korea.” Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> noted, however, that
                            the United States was putting into the South Korean economy each year a
                            sum equivalent to the gross national product of South Korea, and he
                            added that it was no wonder that inflation was running at a 25 percent
                            pace in Korea. The long-term solution to the problem, the Council felt,
                            was to convince the Republic of Korea that security actually depended
                            upon the deterrent power of the striking force of the United States, and
                            that South Korean forces could be reduced with safety to a level
                            supportable by the South Korean economy. The full text of the memorandum

                                before the visit of the Zablocki group. (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >Ibid.,</hi> 795.00/2–855)</note> reports that the Federation of
                            Patriotic Organizations publicly called for a halt of the demonstrations

                            the Federation’s demand for complete withdrawal” of the teams. This
                            development, taken in conjunction with the fact that the Swedes in
                            particular and the Swiss to a slightly less degree are taking positive
                            steps to bring about the withdrawal of all the teams to the
                            Demilitarized Zone, seems to me to make it in our interest <hi

                        <p>I know the difficulty this causes in our relations with Defense, since we
                            backed away from an earlier “firm” date. However, I do think that these
                            new telegrams from Seoul have created a considerably different
                            situation. The strongest arguments Defense has had for prompt movement
                            have been that the continuing demonstrations create an ever present
                            problem of serious conflict between our soldiers and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> citizens and that it is necessary to
                            act during a relative lull in the demonstrations in order to avoid the
                            appearance of <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0224"/>acting under
                            duress. If the demonstrations are in fact called off for three months as
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> has now said he
                            would “do my best” to do, these arguments lose their force.</p>
                        <p>It is clearly so much in our interest to have the action taken by the
                            Swiss and Swedes rather than by ourselves that I recommend that you call

                            subject with him and see whether under the new circumstances he will not
                            agree to allow more time for the Swiss and Swedes to work out a solution

                                    3-month moratorium on demonstrations virtually eliminated the
                                    danger of incidents involving U.S. soldiers and South Korean
                                    civilians for that period, and created the possibility of a

                        <p>Our Chargé, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SCW1">Strom</persName>, asked
                            Admiral Moore, the Senior Member of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command representation on the Military Armistice
                            Commission, to inform the Swiss and Swedish Senior Members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s statement to the Zablocki
                            Subcommittee that he would do his best to have the anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> demonstrations suspended while the
                            Subcommittee endeavored to secure the withdrawal of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s at least to the Demilitarized Zone.
                            Admiral Moore subsequently informed the Swiss and Swedes that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had promised U.S.
                            Congressmen confidentially that he would attempt to have <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> demonstrations suspended for a
                            three-month period. Admiral Moore pointed out that the suspension
                            afforded an ideal time for the Swiss and Swedish members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and perhaps their governments to
                            pursue actively the subject of withdrawal from the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> or at least to the Demilitarized
                            Zone.</p>
                        <p>It is unfortunate that the Swiss and Swedes were informed that the
                            duration of the suspension of the demonstrations was three months. Now
                            that this has been done, however, I think we could redress the situation
                            somewhat if you would speak to the Swedish Ambassador and the Swiss
                            Minister telling them about the conversation between President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and the Zablocki group and
                            emphasizing that we cannot regard the three-month period as firm by any
                            means. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> might at any
                            time decide that progress toward removing the fixed inspection teams was
                            inadequate and might then <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0226"
                            />permit resumption of the anti-<gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            demonstrations. Thus the time in which some action might be taken
                            without the appearance of doing so under duress, is far more limited
                            than three months. We are very much encouraged by the active Swiss and
                            Swedish efforts to have the inspection teams withdrawn to the
                            Demilitarized Zone and would hope that in view of the limited time we
                            feel is available, these efforts will be continued vigorously.</p>
                        <p>If you agree, we will make arrangements to have the Swiss and Swedish
                            representatives come in to see you on Thursday or Friday of this

                                frustration at the continuing lack of authorization to remove the
                                    <gloss target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s in South Korea to the

                                January 1 had been established as deadlines by which such action
                                would be authorized. He was increasingly concerned about the

                                also concerned about the growing friction between the United States

                            by a gross error, he said, he himself had made. He felt that in the last
                            ten days in December when it was apparent that State was not eager to go
                            ahead with instructions to <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>
                            to remove the inspection teams on January [1], he should have informed
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>. He now wanted
                            to review the situation. It was said that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> promised a cessation of the
                                anti-<gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> demonstrations for three
                            months in conversations with Congressman Zablocki’s group. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>, he pointed out,
                            had no conviction about the duration of this period.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he
                            believed there was no dispute on the facts in the situation as presented
                            by General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> in his
                            message. We had, however, understood in the past that the military
                            establishment did not contemplate bringing in any special new equipment
                            to replace that which had become obsolete. The imminent need to do so
                            was a new fact. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            then briefly reviewed the negotiations between the Swiss and Swedes and
                            the Czechs and Poles at Panmunjom and in Prague and Warsaw designed to
                            get agreement on moving the inspection teams to the Demilitarized Zone.
                            The Swedes, he pointed out, had made it clear that if the Communists did
                            not agree to this proposition they would have to withdraw from the
                            Commission. Ambassador Boheman had told Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> that the Swedes had taken a position which
                            made it impossible for them to back out. The Swiss Counselor, whom Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he had just
                            seen, stated that the Swiss Government was hopeful the problem could be
                                solved.<note n="3" xml:id="d109fn3">A memorandum of <persName

                            action. The Swiss were critical of the four-month delay in the
                            acceptance of their earlier proposal for a reduction in the size of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. They emphasized that they
                            were doing what they thought was right and hoped that no pressure of any

                                >Robertson</persName> said that it was difficult to exaggerate the
                            complications which would arise if we were to take unilateral action in
                            removing the teams to the Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the Department
                            felt particularly unhappy about the delay which was involved in dealing
                            with the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. He did feel that had the
                            proposal for a reduction in the size of the Commission been accepted
                            promptly we would now be rid of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. <pb n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0228"/>As it was,
                            he thought it was best to hold off a few weeks more and allow the Swiss
                            and Swedes time to work the problem out.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that several
                            months ago the issue of replacing obsolete equipment had not been so
                            urgent. Now he felt it was a matter of urgency. This was particularly
                            true of the need to introduce new all-weather fighters.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he had understood
                            from Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> that there
                            was no intention to base any large number of planes in Korea since these
                            would be too close to the front in the event of a surprise attack.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that now they
                            would base some planes in Korea if they could. These would not be in
                            large number. Nevertheless, it was felt very important that the Command
                            be able to move the planes back and forth freely between Japan and
                            Korea. He also said there were new tanks and new types of artillery
                            which would be introduced into Korea if it were not for paragraph 13(d)
                            of the Armistice Agreement. In particular, he mentioned the possibility
                            of introducing the 280 mm atomic cannon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he believed the
                            Sixteen were generally sympathetic on the question of replacing obsolete
                            equipment. The British had said last year that they thought we ought to
                            go right ahead and replace obsolete equipment where the Command thought
                            it necessary.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then said that if
                            the inspection teams were eliminated from the Republic of Korea by Swiss
                            and Swedish actions, General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> had suggested two ways in which to handle the
                            introduction of new equipment—first by suspension of paragraph 13(d) and
                            second by simply announcing the fact and explaining it on the basis of
                            an interpretation of paragraph 13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said there was no
                            particular connection between what happened to the inspection teams and
                            the replacement of obsolete equipment with new equipment in Korea. If
                            you suspended paragraphs 13(c) and (d), he said, this would pretty well
                            emasculate the Armistice Agreement. It would leave only an agreement not
                            to fight. If this was done, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1"
                                >Phleger</persName> thought it should be done in the proper way with
                            proper notification to our Allies. It was a political and not a military
                            decision. The inspection teams were merely incidental and would have no
                            function if you took away paragraphs 13(c) and (d). He suggested that
                            Defense might want to work up an analysis to bring out the reasons
                            justifying the action to suspend paragraphs 13(c) and (d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> suggested that it might be
                            best to begin discussion with the Sixteen on the question of paragraph
                            13(d) now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> pointed out that if
                            discussions were held with the Sixteen prematurely and the Swiss and
                            Swedes learned of this, we <pb n="201" xml:id="pg_201" facs="0229"
                            />could not expect the Swiss and Swedes to take favorable action on the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> by the end of January.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> pointed out that
                            General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> had suggested
                            two distinct ways of dealing with the question of paragraph 13(d). One
                            of these was to suspend the paragraph and the other was to reinterpret
                            the paragraph. He pointed out that a good deal of work already had gone
                            into the preparation of a draft report to the United Nations which would
                            explain the reasons for action by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command to introduce new equipment.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> read General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s second
                            alternative and asked whether the group thought this was the best
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that either
                            would be all right, although he preferred suspending paragraph
                            13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he thought it was
                            much easier to handle paragraph 13(d) by interpretation.</p>
                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> then asked what
                            clearances would be necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he would call in
                            the Sixteen and tell them what we would propose to do.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> again asked if this could
                            not be done now.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> said no, he thought
                            not. The teams were to be moved to the Demilitarized Zone on entirely
                            different grounds. It would be best to follow this action somewhat later
                            by action on paragraph 13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            discussion with the Sixteen now would ruin our chances of getting rid of
                            the inspection teams through Swiss and Swedish action. He could say with
                            assurance that the Swedes would much rather we adopt General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s proposal to dissolve the
                            Commission or remove the teams since they would like nothing better than
                            to get out from under the problem. He referred to the importance of
                            keeping the Armistice Agreement, pointing out that as long as we had the
                            agreement if the Communists violated it there were Sixteen nations who
                            would be ready to retaliate and had made a solemn declaration to this
                            effect.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> then asked about the
                            timing on action on paragraph 13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he thought we
                            ought to let the dust settle on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> problem for a few weeks or a month before taking any
                            action on paragraph 13(d). The Swiss, he pointed out, were very touchy
                            on the matter and would not want the actions to be so close as to
                            indicate that they might have been connected with the second. He then
                            explained, in answer to General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName>’s question, the Swiss and Swedish position
                            again.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked whether a message
                            might not be gotten out to General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> which: <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0230"/>

                                    to make a statement in the Military Armistice Commission and
                                    then proceed to replace obsolete equipment.</item>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said he would
                            still like to handle the two problems together and that if he had the
                            power of decision he would do just that.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that if
                            the two problems were handled simultaneously we would build the action
                            up into a significance which it would not otherwise have. He said he
                            thought the idea of a message to General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> along the lines Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gray</persName> suggested was a good idea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the message might
                            conclude by asking General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> whether this contemplated action would meet
                            his needs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> suggested it would be a
                            good idea to have worked up a general schedule with appropriate timing
                            for replacement of obsolete equipment so that it could be shown that
                            this was planned and based on genuine replacement needs.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he wished to be
                            sure that everyone understood that we would not call the Sixteen in to
                            discuss paragraph 13(d) until the teams were removed to the
                            Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> assured the Defense
                            representatives that it would be possible to call in the Sixteen on very
                            short notice, since they are right here in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> suggested to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> that the State Department
                            would be glad to prepare a draft reply to General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> which could then be gone
                            over with Defense.<note n="4" xml:id="d109fn4">On January 11, a joint
                                State–Defense message summarizing the sense of this meeting was sent
                                to General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> as
                                telegram <gloss target="#t_DA1">DA</gloss> 995198. The telegram,
                                signed by <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>, reviewed the
                                state of negotiations with the Swiss and Swedes and concluded that
                                it remained “highly desirable” for the <gloss target="#t_NNIT1"
                                    >NNIT</gloss>s to be removed by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"

                                imbalance in Korea was sent to <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1"
                                    >CINCUNC</gloss> for comment. The tenor of the report was that
                                the clandestine introduction of combat matériel into North Korea, in
                                contravention of the Armistice, was making it impossible for the
                                    <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> to fulfill the injunction
                                established by the Armistice to “insure the stability of the

                                settlement.” To restore the necessary military equilibrium in Korea,
                                the report proposed the replacement of obsolete and worn-out weapons
                                by the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> “in such a manner as to

                            propaganda implications would appear to raise novel and important
                            questions which could lead to charges that vital clauses of the
                            Armistice Agreement had been denounced by the United States. The

                        <p>Ambassador Boheman said that he had just received information from
                            Stockholm on the progress on the negotiations between the Swedes and the
                            Communists with respect to the removal of the inspection teams to the
                            Demilitarized Zone. The Swedish Charge in Peiping recently had been
                            called in by the Chinese Communist Foreign Minister. The Minister had
                            expressed his appreciation of Swedish efforts on the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and said that serious consideration
                            had been given to the Swedish proposal to remove the inspection teams to
                            the Demilitarized Zone. There were, however, practical difficulties
                            involved, the Foreign Minister had said, and he therefore proposed to
                            reduce the inspection teams from three to one in each Zone. In the north
                            the remaining team would be stationed at Sinuiju and in the south either
                            at Inchon or Pusan. He also proposed to substantially reduce the size of
                            the mobile teams and the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> personnel
                            in the Demilitarized Zone. The Swedish Minister in Poland had been given
                            the same proposal, but in addition the Poles had emphasized that if this
                            proposal was not satisfactory to the Swedes they wished to continue the
                            conversations on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman said the Swedes had decided to tell the Chinese and
                            Poles that they would accept the Communist counterproposal provided the
                            remaining inspection team in each Zone was also removed. Instructions to
                            this effect had gone out to Peiping and Warsaw, but the Swedish
                            representatives had been instructed not to act until further advice from
                            Stockholm. The Ambassador said the purpose in this delay was to give the
                            Swedes time to consult with the Swiss. In this connection, he pointed
                            out that the Swedes were in fact carrying on the negotiations although
                            the Swiss were concurring in the Swedish positions.<note n="2"

                                also discussed the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem
                                with Swiss Minister De Torrenté on January 25. De Torrenté indicated
                                that he had not received any recent information from Bern on the
                                subject but offered to inquire. On January 30, De Torrenté saw
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> again and told
                                him that Swiss representatives in Beijing, Warsaw, and Prague had
                                received the same response to the Swedish and Swiss proposal to
                                remove the <gloss target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s to the
                                Demilitarized Zone that Ambassador Boheman had outlined to <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> on January 25. The Swiss
                                Government was disappointed in the Communist reply, but again
                                counseled that results could only come with time and patience.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> dismissed the
                                Communist counter-proposal as a sham and urged the Swiss to press
                                for the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s to
                                the Demilitarized Zone before demonstrations resumed in South Korea.

                            Swedish position and he thought that the instructions to Peiping and
                            Warsaw to inform the Communists of the Swedish position would go out in
                            a day or two.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he was
                            gratified at the progress being made, but he was concerned at the amount
                            of time that these actions were taking. He said he wished to clarify the
                            Swedish position in his own mind. As he understood it, the Swedish
                            position as made clear to the Communists was that the inspection teams
                            stationed in the north and south should be removed to the Demilitarized
                            Zone, and if the Czechs and Poles refused to agree to this proposal the
                            Swedes would be unable to continue on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            said he wished to know whether this position was negotiable or not.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman replied that everything he knew indicated that the
                            position was not negotiable. Certainly it was the Swedish belief that
                            the Czechs and Poles were clearly under this impression. From the manner
                            in which the Peiping counter-proposal had been made and the manner in
                            which the Poles had reiterated that proposal with emphasis on their
                            desire to continue the negotiations if necessary, the Swedes believed
                            that there was a good possibility the Communists would accept the
                            removal of all the inspection teams to the Demilitarized Zone. The
                            Ambassador believed that it was important that the original Swedish
                            position be maintained. To leave one team in each Zone, he told
                            Stockholm, would be a constant source of irritation from the Swedish
                            point of view. The Swedes in these circumstances would continue to have
                            some responsibility for the figures submitted by the two sides without
                            the capability of checking these figures. Leaving but one team in each
                            Zone would be a sham and it would be most undignified for the Swedes to
                            take part in such an operation.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman said that he recently had had a long conversation with
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>, and that the
                            Admiral had confirmed the impression which the Ambassador had gained
                            from Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> that anything
                            short of removal of the inspection teams to the Demilitarized Zone would
                            be unsatisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said this was
                            certainly so. If the teams had been allowed to function properly, it
                            might have been another matter. They were not allowed to function
                            properly, however, and to leave <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0234"
                            />one team in each Zone would, as the Ambassador had said, be a perfect
                            sham, and would place the Swedes in the worst possible position.
                            Ambassador Boheman said that not only would this be an irritant from the
                            Swedish point of view, but also an irritant because of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> concern with the Communists stationed
                            on their territory. In addition, the Ambassador said that he understood
                            that the U.S. felt that there was an absolute necessity to strengthen
                            the military matériel of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command
                            in the south and that it might be necessary to inform the Military
                            Armistice Commission that new materiel will be introduced.<note n="3"

                                States was prepared to act unilaterally to satisfy <persName

                                conversation between Ambassador Boheman and Admiral <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphasized the
                            difficulties with respect to aircraft. The <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command aircraft were antiquated, and spare parts for
                            these planes were no longer manufactured. It was thus impossible to
                            replace aircraft in Korea with identical types. This was a practical
                            difficulty and while there was a problem of technicalities, replacement
                            of these planes with more modern aircraft would not violate the spirit
                            of the Armistice Agreement. One of the purposes of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> was to preserve the military balance
                            between the two sides. This, however, had been impossible to do in view
                            of the Communist violations of the Armistice, and their obstruction of
                            the inspection functions of the Commission. Ambassador Boheman, while
                            suggesting his thought might be somewhat out of order, nevertheless said
                            he thought it would be most advisable from a public opinion point of
                            view to produce tangible proof that the Communist forces in fact had
                            strengthened themselves with more modern weapons. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the reports
                            of the Swiss and Swedish members of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> show that the teams had not been allowed to inspect
                            properly in the north. He pointed out that the Communists had introduced
                            some 450 planes into North Korea, of which over 250 were jet
                            aircraft.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> again expressed
                            concern with the slowness with which the negotiations with the
                            Communists were going. He pointed out that we had hoped to get something
                            done on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> by October, and now it
                            was almost February. Ambassador Boheman said that he felt the only thing
                            that could be done was to repeat what the <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207"
                                facs="0235"/>Swedes had already told the Communists—namely, that if
                            the Communists refused to agree to the Swedish proposal the Swedes would
                            leave the Commission. The Ambassador’s impression was that if the Swedes
                            stick to this position they will gain what they want.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that the
                            Communist delay in reaching a conclusion in the negotiations with the
                            Swedes was a deliberate tactic and one with which he was all too
                            familiar. He then described to Ambassador Boheman the difficulties in
                            attempting to negotiate with the Chinese at Geneva, particularly their
                            delaying tactics and lack of good faith in adhering to even formal
                            public commitments. In response to Ambassador Boheman’s question, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> confirmed his
                            impression that there was no necessary relationship between what
                            happened to the inspection teams in Korea and what might happen to the
                            inspection teams in Indochina. He pointed out that in Indochina as in
                            Korea the Communist member of the inspection teams, a Pole, had been
                            able to effectively block the functioning of these Commissions. While
                            the Canadians had made commendable efforts to hold the teams together,
                            the Indian member under Nehru’s instructions had been reluctant to take
                            a position against the Pole. The Ambassador was glad to have this
                            confirmation. The Canadians, he said, asked the Swedes “every second
                            month” not to do anything about the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> because of the influence they feared such action would
                            have on the Commission in Indochina.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman concluded the meeting by saying that he felt the
                            Communists, in view of the promptness of the Swedish reply to their
                            counter-proposal, were aware that the Swedes desired a quick conclusion
                            of the negotiations. Nevertheless, he said he would send a cable out
                            suggesting that his Government make clear to the Communists the urgency
                            with which the Swedes regarded the matter.</p>

                                >Gordon</persName></hi>: On January 25 I asked the Swedish
                            Ambassador and the Swiss Minister to come to see me hoping to be brought
                            up to <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0236"/>date on the progress of
                            their negotiations with the Communists with respect to the removal of
                            the inspection teams to the Demilitarized Zone. The Swiss Minister had
                            not been informed by his Government of recent developments, but the
                            Swedish Ambassador had a good deal to say which on the whole was most
                            encouraging.</p>
                        <p>The Swedes have taken the lead in the negotiations with the Communists,
                            and in my judgment have made very substantial progress. The Chinese
                            Communists and the Poles have replied to the Swedish proposal that all
                            inspection teams be withdrawn to the Demilitarized Zone with a
                            counter-proposal that all but one team in the north and one in the south
                            be withdrawn and that the mobile teams and other Neutral Nations
                            Supervisory Commission personnel in the Demilitarized Zone be
                            substantially reduced. The Poles emphasized their desire to continue
                            negotiations if the Swedes found the counter-proposal unsatisfactory.
                            The Swedes are replying that they can accept the Communist proposal
                            provided that all inspection teams are withdrawn to the Demilitarized
                            Zone.</p>
                        <p>The Swedish Government believes that the manner in which the Communists
                            replied to the Swedish proposal indicates that there is a good
                            possibility they will accept the removal of all inspection teams to the
                            Demilitarized Zone. I asked the Swedish Ambassador whether the Swedish
                            position—including the Swedish threat to withdraw from the Neutral
                            Nations Supervisory Commission entirely if the Communists did not agree
                            to elimination of the inspection teams— was subject to negotiation. He
                            replied that everything he knew indicated the position was not
                            negotiable and it was the Swedish belief that the Czechs and Poles were
                            clearly under this impression.</p>
                        <p>In response to my concern over the delays in these negotiations, the
                            Swedish Ambassador said he would suggest that his Government make clear
                            to the Communists the urgency with which the Swedes regarded the matter.
                            The Swedes may have a reply to this reaffirmation of their position by
                            the end of this month, but it seems to me to be unlikely. In view of the
                            exchange between President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            and Congressman Zablocki’s group early in December, however, I feel
                            quite confident there is no serious danger of a renewal of the
                            anti-Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission demonstrations in Korea
                            before the first week in March. Taking account of the political and
                            legal difficulties involved in action by the United Nations Command to
                            remove the inspection teams, the success of the Swedish efforts thus far
                            and their determination to accomplish withdrawal of the teams or to
                            withdraw themselves from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, I
                            believe we should allow the Swedes a little more time before we instruct
                            the United Nations Command to take action.</p>
                        <p>I understand, of course, how strongly Defense and <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> feel about the removal of the
                            inspection teams to the Demilitarized <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209"
                                facs="0237"/>Zone. I and most of my colleagues in the Department of
                            State share this view. It seems to me, however, that the Swedes are on
                            the brink of success in persuading the Communists to agree to withdrawal
                            of the inspection teams. This is particularly true since the Communists
                            are faced with a much less desirable alternative from their point of
                            view, namely, elimination of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
                            entirely. I am hopeful, therefore, that you will agree that we should
                            allow the Swedes a little more time to accomplish their objective.</p>

                            <item>With respect to <gloss target="#t_ref1">ref</gloss> A, I consider
                                that the soundest course of action which the United Nations Command
                                could take in obtaining an early solution to the immediate problem
                                of the Armistice Agreement would be to dissolve the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and suspend paras 13c and 13d in
                                a single action as indicated in para 9 of <gloss target="#t_ref1"
                                    >ref</gloss> B. If it is impossible to obtain governmental
                                authorization of this preferred course of action, then I recommend
                                that the alternative course of action indicated in para 10 of <gloss
                                    target="#t_ref1">ref</gloss> B be approved and implemented
                                without delay.<note n="3" target="d113fn3">See <ref

                            <item>While I agree that it is desirable from a political point of view
                                for the Swiss and Swedes to effect the withdrawal of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s from South Korea and recognize
                                that the ideal solution to this problem would be reached if the
                                Swiss and Swedes withdrew from the <pb n="210" xml:id="pg_210"
                                    facs="0238"/>commission itself, I doubt that they will
                                accomplish either of these goals within the next few months. As
                                previously reported to you in <gloss target="#t_ref1">ref</gloss> B,
                                I have been given no assurance by Pres <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> that he will suspend the anti-<gloss
                                    target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss> demonstrations for any specified
                                period of time. Even if Pres <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> carries out the promise he made to the Zablocki
                                Committee to stop the demonstrations for 3 months, only 5 weeks
                                remain before 3 month period will have elapsed. We must assume, and
                                current intelligence supports this assumption, that the
                                demonstrations will be resumed in the near future if positive action
                                is not taken in the interim. If we fail to take advantage of this
                                respite by removing the <gloss target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s from
                                the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                    >UNC</gloss> will have gained nothing and lost much. It will be
                                decidedly to our advantage, and likewise to the advantage of the
                                Swiss and Swedes in attaining their professed desires, if positive
                                remedial action now. Therefore, I recommend that, if the Swiss and
                                Swedes fail to obtain agreement on withdrawal with the Poles and
                                Czechs by 15 Feb 56, I be authorized to carry out my recommendations
                                referred to in para 1 above, and in the order of preference
                                indicated.</item>

                            <item>In either case, I feel that the argument and the basis indicated
                                in <gloss target="#t_ref1">ref</gloss> C will provide the means for
                                the replacement of obsolete equipment. However, with respect to para
                                13d, I feel that it is preferable to suspend it completely rather
                                than “in part” since complete suspension would offer 1 less
                                justification for the continued existence of the <gloss

                                clear to me how 13d could be opened “in part” as mentioned in <gloss

                                make a similar decision with respect to para 13c and for the same

                                d, I still believe as I have previously reported, that it would be a
                                better course of action to treat these matters in a single action.
                                Separating the solutions of these 2 problems (removal of <gloss

                                    that will attain a most critical stage prior to June 1958. As of
                                    that date, practically all the major items of combat matériel
                                    presently in the hands of US forces in Korea will be obsolescent
                                    or will require replacement.</item>

                                    becoming increasingly difficult because of the lack of spare
                                    parts which are no longer being manufactured. Already many
                                    different models of equipment serving the same purpose are in
                                    the hands of troops in Korea. This is serious enough in
                                    peacetime, but under combat conditions would be
                                    intolerable.</item>

                                >NNSC</gloss> and Article 13 (c) and (d) of the Armistice Agreement

                            Consequently, I recommend that he be authorized to act unilaterally to
                            remove the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams to the DMZ and to
                            take necessary action with respect to Article 13 (c) and (d). I suggest
                            further that instructions be sent to him within near future so that he
                            can make plans effect this combined action no later than February 15,
                            but permitting him flexibility of timing to avoid juxtaposition of
                            action to any new Korean propaganda outburst. Although an interpretation
                            of Article 13 (c) and (d) designed to meet his requirements might
                            preserve more of the facade of the Armistice Agreement, it is my opinion
                            (1) that needs of the Command should be the controlling criteria and (2)
                            any interpretation would almost inevitably be considered such a
                            transparent device that it might be more desirable propaganda-wise to
                            meet the issue frankly and clearly. Since unilateral removal of teams to
                            the DMZ will almost surely evoke Communist charges that we are preparing
                            to violate the terms of Article 13 (c) and (d), I believe there is
                            little to be gained in separating these problems. Simultaneous action on
                            these two problems would produce only one occasion for Communist
                            propaganda. To separate them <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0242"
                            />would provide two occasions, on the second of which we could expect
                            the Communists to revive the charges which had been made when the teams
                            were removed and to link these developments. Consequently, I recommend
                            simultaneous action to resolve these two problems.</p>
                        <p>I recognize that these recommendations are contrary to those which the
                            Embassy has previously made on this subject. I base this reversal on the
                            following considerations: (1) I have found General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>’s argument concerning the
                            military necessity for taking action with respect to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and Article 13 (c) and (d) entirely
                            convincing. (2) I do not feel that we can delay any longer in carrying
                            out the assurances first made to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> more than 18 months ago in Washington that the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem would be solved to his
                            satisfaction. (3) <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s
                            suspension of the demonstrations for 90 days, a period which ends March
                            10, affords us the first opportunity since August 1955 to solve these
                            problems without the appearance of duress. (4) Our reading of the
                            telegrams from Bern and Stockholm convinces us that the Swiss-Swedes
                            cannot be expected to dispose of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> problem in a way satisfactory to us by March 10. (5) I
                            feel, therefore, that we, ourselves, must take advantage of this absence
                            of duress and meet the issues squarely and satisfactorily. (6) There is
                            in my judgment no possibility that Pres <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> would agree to a prolongation of this suspension
                            and that we must, therefore, assume that the demonstrations will be
                            resumed with increased vigor when the suspension period ends if no
                            solution has been achieved during it. (7) In fact, Sam-il Day March 1
                            (anniversary 1919 revolution usually celebrated with oratorical
                            extravagances) provides an excellent earlier opportunity to resume the
                            demonstrations which <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> may not
                            overlook.</p>

                            of the Republic of Korea. He emphasized again that they felt strongly
                            about working this out on their own responsibility in an orderly way and
                            would not act if it seemed they were doing so under duress.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> remarked that
                            this was good news and said that he had told <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Syngman Rhee</persName> on his recent visit to Korea that he
                            thought the teams would be out by the end of February. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed the hope that that
                            deadline would be met. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> went on to say that the real problem now
                            involves Clause 13 (d) of the Armistice Agreement, concerning the
                            introduction of new equipment into Korea. He stressed the run-down state
                            of present matériel and spoke of the need to have new planes going in on
                            a rotation basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            said the Department of State agrees thoroughly with the <gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> position on the need for new equipment
                            but suggested there would have to be some time lag between the solution
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem and action on
                            Clause 13 (d).</p>

                                80, will retain his absolute political control as long as he is
                                physically able to hold office. (Para. 18)</item>
                            <item>“2. His primary objectives will remain the unification of Korea
                                under <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> control, maintenance of US
                                aid and support, and opposition to Japanese resurgence. Economic
                                development will remain a subordinate objective. (Para. 48)</item>
                            <item>“3. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> will probably
                                continue to exploit, and even generate crisis situations in an
                                attempt to maximize US support for his objectives. (Paras.

                            <item>“4. The chances of a <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>-initiated attack on the North appear to be slight
                                during the period of this estimate. Principal <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> field commanders would almost
                                certainly stall, but would probably not be able to avoid some
                                implementation of a <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> order
                                to march north. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> retains
                                the capability to initiate armed action designed to provoke general
                                hostilities, (Paras. 52–53)</item>
                            <item>“5. Maintenance of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                                forces depends almost entirely on US support. The <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> army is superior in both offensive
                                and defensive capabilities to the North Korean army alone, but the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> air force is inferior.
                                Because of the greatly superior strength of available Communist
                                forces in northeast Asia, ultimate <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> security will continue to rest on its Mutual
                                Defense Treaty with the US. (Paras. 40, 44, 46–47)</item>
                            <item>“6. If US aid is continued at approximately present levels an
                                appreciable increase in production and some increase in consumption
                                is likely. Nevertheless, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has
                                only a limited capability for economic development. Even were there
                                no military establishment, maintenance of the present low level of
                                economic activity would require substantial foreign assistance.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> will probably
                                continue to be uncooperative at times with the US in the
                                administration of US aid and unwilling to take many steps which
                                could improve the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>’s financial
                                and international trade position. (Paras. 25–38, 57–58)</item>
                            <item>“7. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s departure from
                                office would usher in a period of increased political instability.
                                However, the formal constitutional succession will probably be
                                observed, with de facto leadership probably passing to <persName

                                rule will remain, a more moderate and less authoritarian regime will
                                probably emerge capable of governing substantially as effectively as

                        <p>At the conclusion of Mr. <persName corresp="#p_ARB1"
                            >Anderson</persName>’s briefing of the contents of the reference
                            Progress Report, the President inquired about the size of U.S. forces
                            currently stationed in Korea. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that this force consisted of two
                            divisions. The President then inquired how much money we were putting
                            into Korea annually, both in economic and military assistance. Director
                                Hughes<note n="3" xml:id="d117fn3">Rowland R. Hughes, Director of
                                the Bureau of the Budget.</note> replied that this amounted to
                            approximately $1 billion a year. The President said that South Korea was
                            getting to be a pretty expensive plaything. He then asked whether we
                            were keeping the twenty <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions in
                            active status, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> then inquired
                            whether there was any conceivable way out of this terrible dilemma. Are
                            we to be saddled with payments of $1 billion annually to South Korea
                            from now on out indefinitely?</p>
                        <p>The President replied that the crux of the problem was Communist China.
                            After referring to the problem of having had to fight an “unwinnable”
                            war in Korea, he added that to retreat from Korea now would cost the
                            United States its entire position in the Far East. He desperately
                            wished, nonetheless, that there were some way for the United States to
                            extricate itself from this swamp of spending. If Red China, speculated
                            the President, should finally get out of North Korea, release our
                            prisoners, and act decently, how in the world could the United States
                            continue to avoid recognizing Communist <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218"
                                facs="0246"/>China? It was a real problem, and the President
                            repeated his belief that all our Far Eastern problems focused up in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that with
                            respect to the problem of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s death, this could conceivably end up in a
                            situation which would enable the United States to deal more rationally
                            with the problem of Korea. In point of fact, the South Koreans should be
                            willing to depend far more completely on the deterrent power of our air
                            atomic capabilities. We are well aware that we possess this capability,
                            but President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is not
                            satisfied with anything less than seeing military power in place along
                            the armistice line. Of course, this was understandable in the light of
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s own bitter
                            experience. If, however, <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            should die and we could get through the immediate crisis which would
                            follow, we might end up with a better situation. Until then, it was hard
                            to see what else we can do in Korea than what we are doing.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            was somewhat reluctant to raise so explosive a matter, but it was part
                            of the same general problem. Now that we are under less terrific
                            pressure from Communist China, was any thought being given to the
                            problem of what we will do about Quemoy and the Matsus?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> indicated that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> was quite
                            mistaken in his assumption that we were under less pressure at the
                            moment from Communist China with respect to the offshore islands and
                            Taiwan. In point of fact, the pressure was so severe that the talks
                            which were going on in Geneva at the Ambassadorial level might well be
                            broken off this very day. The Chinese Communists were insisting on their
                            right to take Taiwan, and proposed to take it by force if necessary. We
                            have tried desperately to get them to change this position, but we had
                            failed. Accordingly, this was far from a quiescent period with respect
                            to the problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> brought up the
                            problem of inducing the teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory
                            Commission to withdraw to the demilitarized zone. He said that there
                            were encouraging indications that the Swiss and the Swedes will withdraw
                            their members by the end of February. If this did not occur, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> warmly recommended
                            unilateral action by the United States to this end.</p>
                        <p>In support of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                            >Robertson</persName>’s position, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> noted that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s moratorium on South Korean demonstrations against
                            the teams was scheduled to end on the 9th of March. He and General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> felt so strongly
                            about the necessity of getting rid of these teams that they had called
                            on President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> recently and
                            informed him that he could probably count on the withdrawal of the teams
                            to the demilitarized zone before the 9th of March. Admiral <pb n="219"
                                xml:id="pg_219" facs="0247"/><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> stated his belief that it was essential to get
                            the teams into the demilitarized zone by that date.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then turned to
                            the problem of those provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement which
                            prevented the United States from sending into South Korea any new
                            military matériel. This was getting to be an increasingly grave problem,
                            especially for the Air Force, which could send in no new planes in
                            replacement of old ones that had worn out. The Army was also beginning
                            to feel the pinch. New troops sent to Korea as replacements had to be
                            retrained in the use of the old equipment which they had to use in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> then stated his
                            conviction that unless Korea was reunited there was no hope whatever for
                            a viable Korean economy. Accordingly, he recommended that in any
                            forthcoming disarmament negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>, we should press them to permit the unification of
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> concluded his
                            remarks by paying tribute to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>, whom he believed more of an asset to the United
                            States than a liability. For all his faults, <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> was the <persName>George</persName> Washington of
                            Korea, and the people of Korea strongly supported him. There was no
                            alternative to his forceful control of the country except, perhaps,
                            military control.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> observed that
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had painted a
                            very dismal picture.</p>

                            said he wished to put a question to the Secretary of State. If the
                            negotiations at Geneva with the Chinese Communists were in fact broken
                            off, was it likely that the Chinese Communists would move promptly
                            against Quemoy and the Matsus?</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that
                            available intelligence indicated no immediate likelihood of such a
                            Chinese Communist move. Nevertheless, the Chinese Communists were
                            continuing to develop their capabilities for such an operation, and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> believed that
                            they could amass sufficient forces in a matter of a couple of weeks to
                            seize these offshore islands if they decided to do so. He did not think,
                            however, that they would resort to force in the near future, even if the
                            negotiations were broken off. It was more likely that they would
                            continue to go on as they have been, although with more threatening
                            noises.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that in a couple of private conversations with Sir
                            Anthony Eden during the latter’s recent visit,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d117fn5">Prime Minister Eden visited the United States,
                                January 30–February 3.</note> the Prime Minister had said in effect
                            that he lived in terror that a situation might arise in which the United
                            States found itself obliged to go to war and that he, Eden, would be
                            unable to come to the support of <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0248"
                            />the United States because of British public opinion. The President
                            wondered whether these remarks were a back-handed reference to Quemoy
                            and the Matsus.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought that the
                            President’s surmise was quite likely to have been correct. He pointed
                            out, however, that in their propaganda the Chinese Communists
                            persistently and carefully avoided any suggestion of taking Quemoy and
                            the Matsus except within the total picture of their determination to
                            take Taiwan by force if necessary.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            nevertheless believed it likely that if the Chinese Communists finally
                            decided to try to seize Taiwan, they were quite likely to move against
                            Quemoy and the Matsus first. If they stopped there for a while they
                            would certainly put the United States on the spot.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen wondered whether the Chinese Communists might not seek a
                            meeting between Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            and Chou En-lai during the course of the Secretary’s forthcoming visit

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear <persName>Walter</persName></hi>: Thank you for
                            your very informative letter of 30 January 1956<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d119fn2"><ref target="#d112">Document 112</ref>.</note> in
                            which you enclosed a copy of your memorandum <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222"
                                facs="0250"/>of conversation with the Swedish Ambassador and the
                            Swiss Minister<note n="3" xml:id="d119fn3">A copy of the memorandum of
                                conversation with Swedish Ambassador Boheman on January 25 was
                                attached to the January 30 letter. The memorandum of conversation is
                                printed as <ref target="#d111">Document 111</ref>.</note> on the
                            progress of their negotiations with the Communists with respect to the
                            removal of the <gloss target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s to the
                            Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>I am seriously concerned about the time phasing of the removal of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>’s to the Demilitarized Zone. I
                            note also that you and your colleagues in the Department of State are no
                            less concerned. I fully agree that the easiest method of accomplishing
                            this objective is through the proposed action of the Swedish and Swiss
                            Governments. It is imperative, however, in my opinion, that whatever
                            action is taken be accomplished without concurrent demonstrative
                            pressure from the Government of South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Several deadlines have passed without the amelioration of what you and I
                            agree is a bad situation. The uncertainty, as I have previously pointed
                            out has been troublesome to us and has had an unsettling effect upon
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> in dealing with this
                            problem in the field. It is not unlikely that the Communists will seek
                            to prolong the current situation in the hope that <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>, under pressure from President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, will unilaterally remove
                            the teams to the Demilitarized Zone and thereby afford them an
                            opportunity to exploit such an action as a violation of the Armistice
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Accordingly, I feel that the Swedes and the Swiss should be under the
                            same compulsion of time, and that it would not be in the best interest
                            of their reputation as Neutral Nations to be forced into a solution of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem by publicly
                            acknowledged pressure either from the United States or the Republic of
                            Korea. For that reason, I believe that the Swedes and Swiss should
                            communicate a date of February 25th to the Poles and Communists, prior
                            to which mutual agreement with these two Governments must be reached,
                            and that they should give us assurances that if mutual agreement is not
                            reached by such a date, they would unilaterally withdraw their <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members out of Korea or at least to
                            the Demilitarized Zone. Such a plan, in my opinion, may very likely be
                            acceded to by the Communists, rather than accept elimination of neutral
                            inspection machinery. It would appear that this date should allow ample
                            time for the United States to take the necessary measures to accomplish
                            the desired result should action by the Swedes and Swiss fail to
                            materialize.</p>
                        <p>It is the position of the Department of Defense that any action should
                            comfortably precede 8 March, the terminal date of the period of grace
                            afforded by the Zablocki commitment.<note n="4" xml:id="d119fn4">See
                                    <ref target="#d106">Document 106</ref>.</note> I feel it
                            unnecessary <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0251"/>to belabor the
                            point that this commitment was, in a sense, a quid pro quo, and that our
                            half of the bargain was to do our utmost to accomplish a solution to
                            problems during the period of suspended demonstrations. It is probable
                            that if steps are not taken which will assure definite results we will
                            ultimately face the same problem after it has deteriorated from bad to
                            worse.</p>
                        <p>On behalf of the Department of Defense, I feel that due to the time
                            element, the proposal made herein should be implemented at the earliest
                            practicable moment.<note n="5" xml:id="d119fn5"><persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> responded with letters to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> on February 13 and
                                February 15. In the first, he noted that the Swiss and the Swedes
                                seemed to be making progress in their efforts to achieve the removal
                                of the inspection teams to the demilitarized zone. In light of the
                                progress being made by the Swiss and the Swedes, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> felt that “we should hold
                                up any unilateral action for the time being in order to permit these
                                negotiations to come to a head.” (Department of State, Central
                                Files, 795.00/2–1356) In the February 15 letter, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> referred specifically to
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName>’s proposal that the
                                Swiss and the Swedes be encouraged to set February 25 as the
                                deadline for a settlement of the issue. The United States, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> noted, had never pressed
                                Sweden and Switzerland to issue an ultimatum to the Communists. To
                                do so, he argued, would be counterproductive. There was little
                                prospect of obtaining agreement from the Communists to such an
                                ultimatum, and the Swiss and the Swedes would be certain to resent
                                an attempt to dictate to them from Washington. (<hi rend="italic"

                            Zone.</p>
                        <p>Addressing myself first to the last paragraph of your letter of February
                            15, I do not know what would lead us to believe that President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would notify us of a proposed
                            renewal of demonstrations. I would expect any demonstrations to be
                            initiated without our knowledge. In such circumstances if the policy we
                            adopted in the past prevailed, we would be inhibited from taking any
                            action to <pb n="224" xml:id="pg_224" facs="0252"/>remove the teams. It
                            is clear to me that we cannot again allow ourselves to be put in such a
                            position.</p>
                        <p>I wish to remind you that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s commitment to the moratorium on demonstrations
                            will end on about March 8. The Department of Defense is firmly of the
                            view that the teams cannot continue as they are beyond this date.</p>
                        <p>I agree with you that we should emphasize to the Swiss and Swedes our
                            continued and urgent interest in a prompt solution. I also believe,
                            however, that whatever we say to the Swiss and Swedes, if they have not
                            accomplished the purpose through diplomatic negotiations by the first of
                            March, we should on that date take unilateral action. I see no reason
                            why they should not be informed of our intention and plan, but would
                            defer to your judgment in respect to that particular matter.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YCYD1">You</persName> will recall that we were
                            assured that the Swiss-Swede approach would get results in the latter
                            half of January. Nevertheless, we find ourselves in the latter half of
                            February without definitive action.</p>
                        <p>In view of our conviction that the teams must be removed by March 1 by
                            one means or another, I suggest that our respective staffs meet
                            immediately to make such preparations as may be necessary for unilateral
                            action, if that be required.</p>

                            on March 1 would be to make a report of the substantial Swiss and

                            their negotiations to a satisfactory conclusion. Following our

                            one fixed team in the north and one in the south and are standing firm
                            on their proposal that all inspection teams be removed to the
                            Demilitarized Zone. We have also suggested that President <persName

                            had asked that a little more time be given them and that the cessation

                            Korea had greatly facilitated their negotiations with the Czechs and

                            cannot agree, however, that it would be wise to instruct the United
                            Nations Command to take action on March 1. As I have said previously,
                            such action in our view would incur serious political and propaganda
                            disadvantages for the United States. On the other hand, successful
                            action by the Swiss and Swedes leading to removal of the teams to the
                            Demilitarized Zone would have positive political and propaganda
                            advantages for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Of course, I believe that we must keep this matter constantly under

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> opened the meeting by asking Ambassador
                            Boheman if he had heard anything new with respect to the Swiss and
                            Swedish negotiations with the Communists to obtain agreement on the
                            withdrawal of all <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> inspection teams
                            to the Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman said there was nothing very much new, but that his
                            Government, two or three days ago, had made another démarche to Peiping
                            asking for a reply to the Swedish rejection of the Communist
                            counterproposal to retain one inspection team each in the north and
                            south. The Ambassador said that the Swedish demarche had implied that
                            the Swiss and Swedes would not remain on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> if the Communists did not agree to the proposal to
                            withdraw all inspection teams to the Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> pointed out that today ended the
                            three-month period during which President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> had agreed to call off the anti-<gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> demonstrations. We felt, therefore,
                            that this issue was likely to come <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230"
                                facs="0258"/>to a head. We were gravely concerned that it may become
                            increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to avoid a serious incident
                            because of the continued presence of the Czechs and Poles on Republic of
                            Korea territory. Time was now of the essence and we felt that we had to
                            know with some degree of certainty just where we stand on the matter. We
                            needed to know whether there would be progress toward the solution of
                            this problem and if so when a solution could be expected. This was
                            particularly important in light of the Secretary’s visit to Korea on
                            March 17, and in order to get information to him by that time it would
                            have to be in our hands by March 15.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said that about ten days ago, and
                            following our conversations with the Swiss and Swedes, we had reported

                                >Rhee</persName> in general terms the progress being made by the
                            Swiss and Swedes on the problem of the inspection teams.<note n="2"

                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> feels that he has
                            been eminently patient and reasonable. It is important now that the
                            Secretary be able to say with a degree of certainty, although not
                            specifying the means, that the Czechs and Poles will be removed shortly.
                            If the Secretary can give President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> such definite assurances, we perhaps can hold the
                            line a little while longer. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> emphasized
                            the appreciation of the U.S. for the Swiss and Swedish participation on
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and our gratitude for their
                            recent efforts to find a solution to this difficult problem. In stating
                            our position to Ambassador Boheman, we were not trying to place pressure
                            on the Swedes. We felt that in view of our close and friendly relations
                            we could explain this situation openly and frankly. Ambassador
                                <persName>Willis</persName> had been asked to make a similar
                            approach in Bern.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman said that the Swiss and Swedes were pushing as hard as
                            they could and that it was his impression from his Government and from
                            conversations with the Swiss that if the Communists failed to reply
                            favorably in a short time, the Swiss and Swedes will remove their
                            members from the inspection teams. The Swedes were very anxious to get
                            out. The idea of retaining one team in each Zone was absolutely
                            ridiculous, and the Swedes did not want to continue to have
                            responsibilities which they were unable to carry out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> asked whether it would be possible for
                            the Ambassador to get from his Government a fairly definite idea of the
                            time element involved in their negotiations and the course of action his
                            Government might take in the event no favorable reply is received from
                            the Communists. In view of the strength of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s feeling on this matter, the
                            Secretary would have to be able to speak with considerable certainty and
                            definiteness.</p>
                        <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0259"/>
                        <p>Ambassador Boheman clearly understood the U.S. need to give President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> a more definite
                            understanding. He said he would cable his Government and urge they try
                            to get an answer from the Communists. Failing that, he would suggest his
                            Government tell the U.S. by March 15 more definitely about their concept
                            of the timing and the course of action they would follow in event of no
                            favorable answer by the Communists.<note n="3" xml:id="d124fn3">In
                                telegram 879 from Stockholm, March 12, the Embassy reported that
                                Sweden had made another approach to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the
                                People’s Republic of China to reiterate that Sweden could not accept
                                the proposal to leave one inspection team each in North and South
                                Korea. According to a Foreign Office official, however, Sweden did
                                not request a reply by a specific date, nor imply unilateral action
                                if the Swedish position was not accepted. (Department of State,

                            Deptel 1541, March 6. Emphasis placed on need to know within next few

                        <p>Zehnder in reply made two principal points: <list>

                                <item>Swiss not prepared to say in advance of receipt of Communist
                                    reply that Swiss and Swedish action would result in withdrawal
                                    all teams to Demilitarized Zone.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>Telegram had already been received from Swiss Legation Peking
                                    reporting that request for reply to Swiss aide-mémoire of
                                    February 7 made and Chinese had indicated reply could be
                                    expected within matter of days. Zehnder promised to let me know
                                    as soon as he had anything further.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Zehnder stated if Swedish and Swiss proposal accepted by Communists, no
                            problem. If Communist answer negative, might be accompanied by
                            compromise counter proposal. Swiss had given no indication whatever they
                            would be disposed to accept compromise. If Communists offered to
                            withdraw teams “provisionally” to Demilitarized <pb n="232"
                                xml:id="pg_232" facs="0260"/>Zone with inspections to be carried out
                            by agreement of both sides Swiss might consider such compromise as it
                            would in fact achieve withdrawal of teams to Demilitarized Zone. There
                            would never be agreement of both sides to an inspection, therefore teams
                            would remain in Demilitarized Zone. By “provisional” withdrawal of
                            teams, principle of existence of teams would be preserved and terms of
                            Armistice maintained.</p>
                        <p>Swiss understand fully and sympathize difficulties of our situation and
                            need to meet March 17 deadline. Zehnder stated to date Swiss had avoided
                            setting fixed date for reply but if nothing forthcoming would consider
                            requesting answer by given date.</p>
                        <p>In view worldwide advantage to US of having Swiss and Swedes achieve
                            withdrawal of teams to Demilitarized Zone, I again urge maximum
                            cooperation to that end.</p>

                                of Korea and Japan, contained a request that the Secretary “accord

                                problem with which it is confronted as a result of the intransigence

                        <p>The Finance Minister then briefly outlined the following three questions.
                            (1) Use of counterpart funds—an increased proportion of which he hoped
                            could be devoted to reconstruction purposes. (2) Need for additional aid
                            in fiscal year 1956 to avoid budgetary deficit. (3) Desirability of a
                            long range US aid program. (He also gave Secy memorandum. )<note n="6"

                                requested the United States to make a concrete economic aid
                                commitment on which the Republic of Korea could base a 5-year
                                development plan. Attached to the memorandum as an appendix was a

                        <p>Minister Son then presented <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> request
                            for substantial increase in military assistance amounting to
                            $329,800,000 in <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957. This amount of
                            additional aid would permit an increase of approximately 45 percent in

                            prescribed in the agreed minute. (Memorandum containing details also

                        <p>Paek Tu-jin referred to extensive devastation during war, need for

                            working on a five-year plan of economic reconstruction which would
                            involve expenditure $2.4 <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0263"

                            requirements. He said that plan would be presented through proper

                            Assembly. He said that he had always tried to be faithful to sentiment
                            that <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s do not stand alone. The United
                            States was a firm and continuing friend of Korea. He commented that he
                            would study the requests and have them carefully examined by
                                experts.<note n="8" xml:id="d127fn8">On May 16, the Department

                                Secretary on March 17. With respect to additional military aid, the
                                Embassy was instructed to respond that the United States “considers
                                present forces, backed by U.S. striking power, adequate for the
                                security of Korea.” With respect to the request for a long-term
                                commitment of economic aid, the Embassy was instructed to remind the
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> government that the
                                executive branch of the U.S. Government was unable to enter into

                                Congress. The Korean plan would be carefully considered, however, as
                                a basis for future planning for implementation of aid funds as they
                                became available. (Department of State, Seoul Embassy Files: Lot 62

                        <p>Then the Secy said it was necessary for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s to understand certain basic concepts of US foreign and
                            military policy. He outlined the difference in mission between forces in
                            the front line and those in the strategic striking reserve. He pointed
                            out that the answer to the combined Russian and Chinese forces operating
                            with interior lines of communication was a strategic reserve with mobile
                            striking power which is a deterrent and can be quickly employed against
                            an attack at any point along the Communist periphery. The UALI [<hi
                                rend="italic">Secy?</hi>] said that in the event of Communist
                            aggression this force was committed for common defense in the <gloss

                        <p>With respect economic aid, the Secy asked the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Ministers to bear in mind that he had received on this
                            trip a total of requests which if met would destroy the soundness of the
                            United States economy. He said that the amount of available US aid was
                            limited by economic and political realities. He likened American
                            economic aid to ammunition which must be rationed, which was not
                            accorded on basis friendship, but as contribution to winning cold war.
                            He said each country should quite properly present its case. He
                            emphasized that the United States would weigh <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> needs in the light of the overall requirements and then
                            allocate available American aid where it would best contribute to
                            relieving our worldwide objectives. He added that the Korean aid program
                            has been our largest one and that the amount of US assistance to Korea
                            is a measure of the importance which we have felt Korea has had in the
                            cold war.</p>

                            of friendship. I tried to give him some of the impressions of my trip,
                            but he showed little interest, and he did not follow what I was
                            saying.</p>
                        <p>I talked briefly with the Foreign Affairs, Finance and Defense
                            Secretaries, who presented requests for additional military and economic
                            aid. I gave them a brief talk on the mission of local defense in
                            relation to strategic striking power and also a picture of the multiple
                            demands made upon us from many quarters and the need for maintaining the
                            soundness of our own economy. I hope that this may help to cushion
                            future disappointments.</p>
                        <p>On the whole relations seem calmer than they have been for the past three
                            years. I am particularly struck with the fact that nothing was said to
                            me about the elimination of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
                            although <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s “deadline” for its
                            elimination <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237" facs="0265"/>was March 17, the
                            date of my arrival. I do not, however, mean by this to imply that this
                            is a dead issue.</p>

                            inconclusive results of our recent démarches to the Swiss and
                                Swedes,<note n="2" xml:id="d129fn2">See <ref target="#d123"

                            it now seems appropriate to take another look at the alternative courses
                            of action open to us. In so doing I believe we should consider the
                            problem of paragraph 13(d), the reinforcing restrictions of the
                            Armistice, in conjunction with our consideration of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem.</p>
                        <p>Of these two issues, the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and
                            paragraph 13(d), the latter is of far more fundamental importance. The
                            importance of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> is in the
                            context of an irritant to U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            relations. The importance of action on paragraph 13(d) is the
                            rectification of the serious military disadvantage in which the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command has been placed. Our position on
                            these issues has been to follow action by the Swiss and Swedes on the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> with <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command action a month later to permit replacement of
                            obsolete equipment. In my memorandum to you of February 29,<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d129fn3">Not printed. (Department of State, <gloss

                            suggested a possible alternative, namely, that if it were determined
                            that unilateral action should be taken by the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command to remove the Czech and Polish components of the

                            question of paragraph 13(d).</p>
                        <p>I now would like to suggest a third course of action which I believe is
                            even more desirable. This course of action would involve: (1) <pb
                                n="238" xml:id="pg_238" facs="0266"/>continued efforts to persuade
                            the Swiss and Swedes to take action on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>, but recognition of the possibility that they may be
                            very slow in doing so; (2) giving highest priority to the question of
                            paragraph 13(d), move as rapidly as possible and independently of action
                            on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> to permit the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command to introduce more modern
                            conventional type weapons. We would, of course, need to inform the
                            Sixteen of our plans to take action on paragraph 13(d) and should seek
                            their concurrence, although not make their concurrence a necessary
                            prerequisite to our action. This course of action has the following
                            advantages: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>

                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>This course of action could be explained to President
                                        <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> in such a way as
                                    to forestall a renewal of demonstrations against the <gloss
                                        target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> for several months, thus
                                    permitting the Swiss and Swedes to continue their efforts to
                                    reach agreement with the Communists. He could be told that we
                                    have decided to deal with the most fundamental problem first and
                                    that in view of this contemplated action we feel strongly we
                                    must let the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> issue coast a
                                    while longer.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>We should inform the Swiss and Swedes of our contemplated
                                    action on paragraph 13(d) as soon as we have informed the
                                    Sixteen making clear to them we cannot delay any longer in the
                                    introduction of more modern weapons. They almost certainly will
                                    claim that action on reinforcement will render more difficult
                                    the task of working out an <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                                    agreement. However, the prospect of this action as well as the
                                    action itself will probably add to the discomfort of their
                                    position and may, therefore, have the ultimate effect of
                                    stimulating them to either reach agreement with the Communists
                                    or withdraw themselves to the Demilitarized Zone.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>From a propaganda standpoint, action to replace obsolete
                                    weapons would be more acceptable, if action by the <gloss

                                    teams was delayed for several months, as this would underline

                                <item>This course of action should be acceptable to Defense, since
                                    they are genuinely concerned with strengthening the arms of

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            approximately one month has passed since the Swiss and Swedes handed
                            their latest note to the Communists on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>, and that the U.S. is concerned because the Communists
                            appear to be delaying solution of this problem.</p>
                        <p>Count <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">Douglas</persName> said he had asked
                            the Swedish Foreign Office late last week whether any reply had been
                            received and had been told there had not. He agreed that approximately
                            one month had elapsed since the Swiss and Swedes had presented a
                            so-called “compromise” proposal. The Communists had previously suggested
                            that the fixed inspection teams be reduced to one in each zone. The
                            Swiss-Swedish “compromise” proposal was in effect the original Swedish
                            position: It suggested that the proposals be compromised by withdrawing
                            all teams to the Demilitarized Zone after which teams <pb n="240"
                                xml:id="pg_240" facs="0268"/>might be sent out as agreed within the
                                Commission.<note n="2" xml:id="d130fn2">This is the first report
                                that the Swedish démarche contained such a compromise proposal.
                                Previous information indicated merely that the Swedes pressed for a
                                reply and implied they would be forced to withdraw if the Communists
                                did not agree to movement of the inspection teams to the
                                Demilitarized Zone. [Footnote in the source text.]</note> Count
                                <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">Douglas</persName> explained that the
                            Swedish intention was that no fixed teams would hereafter be agreed
                            to.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he believes the
                            Communists are simply drawing out the negotiations. He cited the
                            experience of Ambassador Dean in negotiations to arrange a Korean
                            political conference, and his own experience in the China truce
                            negotiations. He said the Communists would try to avoid accepting the
                            Swiss-Swedish proposal until they were confronted with an unacceptable
                            alternative. The Communists clearly desire that the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> continue in existence. Now that the
                            Swiss and Swedes have stated their position firmly it would be desirable
                            for them to press the Communists to accept it by giving the alternative
                            of Swiss-Swedish withdrawal from the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. We persuaded President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> to halt the demonstrations for a time in order to
                            facilitate the Swiss and Swedish negotiations with the Communists, but
                            this situation cannot endure indefinitely. An incident might occur at
                            any time which would upset the tranquillity now existing in Korea. None
                            of us wants to see this happen except the Communists, who may in fact be
                            protracting the negotiations for this very purpose.</p>

                        <p>With respect to the Chinese Communist request in paragraph 3 of the note
                            that the United Kingdom and the other governments of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command call a conference of the nations
                            concerned to discuss withdrawal of foreign forces from Korea and
                            peaceful unification of Korea, the British Government suggests that the
                            Chinese Communist proposal be conveyed formally to the other governments
                            of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command through the normal
                            mechanism of the meetings of the Sixteen in Washington. The British
                            Government asked the views of the British Embassy and the Department of
                            State on procedures of handling the Chinese Communist note.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Norred</persName> asked whether the views of any of the
                            other governments of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command had
                            been sought on this question. Mr. <persName>Youde</persName> said that
                            he understood the Canadians knew of the note and that he believed that
                            it had not been conveyed outside the Commonwealth countries, and
                            possibly not even to Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Norred</persName> indicated that he was receiving the note
                            so that the Department might study it to exchange views with the British
                            Government on procedures in handling it and that the British should not
                            consider that they have formally conveyed it to the U.S. as the Chinese
                            Communists requested in paragraph 3 of the note.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Youde</persName> said that he was sure that this was what
                            the British Government contemplated at this stage. He said that he would
                            provide further information about British consultations on the note, and
                            that he would await reply as to the views of the United States.<note

                            <p>The Governments of Sweden and Switzerland have, on many occasions,
                                stated to the Chinese Government the practical difficulties which
                                they have encountered in their work in the Neutral Nations
                                Supervisory Commission in Korea and have expressed the hope that a
                                settlement could be reached. The Chinese Government sympathizes
                                [grp. undec. ? strongly] with the position of the Governments of
                                Sweden and Switzerland and have endeavoured unceasingly to try to
                                mitigate their difficulties. Recently the Swedish Government
                                proposed that the whole of the six neutral observation teams, which
                                are at present stationed in designated ports in south and north
                                Korea, should be withdrawn for the time being and that observation
                                teams should be despatched temporarily only when the need arose,
                                while the Swiss Government proposed that the existing neutral
                                observation teams in the six designated ports should be eliminated
                                and that mobile observation teams only should be retained. The
                                Chinese Government hold that a fundamental solution to the practical
                                difficulties which the Governments of Sweden and Switzerland have
                                repeatedly raised, can only be reached when a solution has been
                                reached on the question of peaceful unification of Korea and first
                                of all on the question of withdrawing all foreign forces from
                                Korea.</p>

                                <item>Since the Geneva conference on Korea in 1954, Korean and
                                    Chinese sides have consistently advocated that a conference of
                                    the Nations concerned should be called to discuss the question
                                    of withdrawal from Korea of all foreign forces and the peaceful
                                    unification of Korea. The Chinese Government are, moreover,
                                    convinced that if all parties concerned are genuinely desirous
                                    of seeking a settlement a reasonable solution to these questions
                                    could be reached.</item>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that he
                            feels it is most important for the U.S. to carry out the promises it has
                            made to get the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission activities out of
                            South Korea. These groups are not neutral, are providing intelligence
                            information to the communists and are causing great concern to Korean
                            and U.S. military authorities. He said that the Korean demonstrations
                            last August against the neutral inspection teams had been very serious
                            and had been restrained only with great difficulty. Recurrence of such
                            demonstrations could be very dangerous for the safety of U.S. military
                            elements in Korea. General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> added that he did not know about latest
                            developments in negotiations with Sweden and Switzerland but was not
                            optimistic that these negotiations would be successful. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> summarized the contents of
                            the latest Chinese Communist note<note n="2" xml:id="d132fn2"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> on Korea which proposed an
                            international conference. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> agreed that this note was one more propaganda
                            strategem by the Chinese Communists. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> also said that he had had a number of
                            discussions with <pb n="244" xml:id="pg_244" facs="0272"/>Swedish and
                            Swiss representatives but that effective results had not been
                            forthcoming; the Swedish Ambassador in Washington talks a lot more
                            resolutely than his government is willing to act. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that he had just talked
                            to some Senators about this matter and they found it impossible to
                            understand why we put up with this situation. He noted that the
                            communists are bringing in substantial military equipment in violation
                            of the armistice, while we are hamstrung by armistice provisions
                            prohibiting introduction of new weapons. We are thus not able to
                            maintain the balance of strength in Korea envisaged by the armistice
                            agreement. Our weakness is particularly serious in the case of aircraft,
                            such as all-weather planes. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> commented that the situation in Korea is a
                            perfect illustration of what the communists mean by inspection and that
                            if the U.S. ever agrees to disarmament arrangements involving
                            inspection, this is exactly the kind of situation we would face. He said
                            we would be foolish to get into this situation. [Here follows discussion
                            of unrelated subjects.]</p>

                            states that until these problems are solved, the <gloss

                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and to place the U.S. in a bad

                            from the area on the grounds that Communist obstruction of the <gloss

                            provisions of the Armistice have suspended our obligation to permit
                            their activities south of the Demilitarized Zone (DZ). It seems
                            pointless to press the <pb n="245" xml:id="pg_245" facs="0273"/>Swiss
                            and Swedes further. Our main objective now should be to secure the
                            support of our Allies for such action. Reply to the note, which the
                            British can send in behalf of the 16 participating Nations, must include
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem, although we would
                            make the detailed announcement in the Military Armistice Commission

                        <p>Our Allies probably will support rejection of the conference proposal on
                            the ground that it would serve no useful purpose and will accept also

                            <p>We have long regarded the frustration of the hopes of the Korean
                                people for unification of their country as the basic problem in
                                Korea. At Geneva we set forth in detail our position with regard to
                                a just settlement of this problem in conformity with the objectives
                                of the United Nations. This position was reiterated at the past two
                                sessions of the General Assembly, where it was endorsed by an
                                overwhelming majority of the Members of the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the Communist proposal for a conference on the
                                withdrawal of foreign troops and the unification of Korea we are not
                                aware of any change in the Communist position which would render
                                such a conference fruitful. Until the Communist side is prepared to

                                the basis of the United Nations objectives, another conference would
                                only bring about a repetition of the deadlock which resulted at
                                Geneva. For our part we remain ready to discuss the unification on
                                the basis of the United Nations objectives. If the Communist side
                                has concrete proposals for a settlement of the Korean question in
                                conformity with the objectives of the United Nations, we are
                                prepared to give such proposals every consideration.</p>
                            <p>We do not regard the problem of the Neutral Nations Supervisory
                                Commission as linked in any way with the question of the unification
                                of Korea. Pending agreement on unification, the Armistice Agreement
                                remains in force in Korea, and all parties concerned should endeavor
                                to maintain the effectiveness of the Armistice and to correct
                                problems that arise regarding it. We wish to reaffirm our support of
                                the Armistice Agreement and our intention to contribute to peace in
                                the area.</p>
                            <p>The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has long since ceased to
                                fulfill its functions under the Armistice Agreement because of
                                Communist obstruction. We believe the proposals of the Governments
                                of Switzerland and Sweden to withdraw all Neutral Nations
                                Supervisory Commission personnel to the Demilitarized Zone are
                                reasonable. They present a practical solution to this problem, given
                                the attitude of the Communist side toward their reporting
                                responsibilities and the obstacles they have presented to effective
                                supervision by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission north of
                                the Demilitarized Zone. The Communist side has now rejected the
                                proposals of Switzerland and Sweden and it is evident from the
                                Chinese Communist note of April 9, 1956, that the Communist side
                                does not intend to agree to a solution of the Neutral Nations
                                Supervisory Commission problem. Under these circumstances, the
                                activities of the Czech and Polish components of the Neutral Nations
                                Supervisory Commission south of the Demilitarized Zone are an
                                inequitable burden on the United Nations side. The United Nations
                                Command will announce its position on this matter fully in the
                                Military Armistice Commission.</p>

                        <p>1018. Lind Foreign Office Bureau Chief informed us today Chinese answered

                            after Swiss approval stating: (1) regret Chinese would not accept
                            Swedish compromise proposal (that teams might be sent out when need
                            arose upon decision of <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>); (2)
                            repeating basic Swedish position favoring abolition all <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams; (3) Sweden still willing
                            accept its compromise, however (4) lacking such compromise and absence
                            any new agreement prepared for time being accept proposal made earlier
                            by Chinese reducing number teams from 6 (3 on each side) to 2 (1 on each
                            side) with <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> retaining right
                            despatch teams to places from which other two teams withdrawn in case of
                            need.</p>
                        <p>Lind volunteered he did not think US would be pleased by proposed Swedish
                            reply but saw two advances: it would reduce number teams, thus relative
                            improvement, and it showed Sweden did not accept Chinese reply linking
                            matter to proposal for conference. Emphasized Sweden unable pull out
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> because importance it placed
                            on its international responsibilities. Speculated if Chinese accept
                            Swedish proposal all well for time being so far Sweden concerned,
                            although recognized temporary nature solution. If Chinese do not accept,
                            which he did not think likely, claimed Swedish Government would take dim
                            view, but emphasized speculative nature this phase discussion. Stated
                            Ambassador Boheman informed about proposed Swedish reply. Swedes of
                            course do not know if Swiss will accept.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said that he had talked with the Korean
                            Chargé in the morning, and had given him a general outline of our
                            thinking.</p>
                        <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0278"/>
                        <p>The Chargé was pleased, but had no instructions. Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> said he had expressed appreciation for
                            the restraint shown on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem
                            by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> in recent months, and had
                            asked their continued forbearance. He had also asked and received
                            assurance that the Chinese Communist note and our thinking on it, would
                            not be publicized. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said that the U.S.
                            has learned that the Swedes have received a reply from the Chinese
                            Communists merely referring to the Chinese Communist note of April 9 to
                            the 16 proposing a conference. The Swedish Chargé has not approached us
                            about it, and we have not called him in. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName>
                            then asked the representatives of the Embassies to report the views of
                            their governments on the proposals we presented on April 26.<note n="2"

                        <p>The British Minister said his Government made no comment on the first
                            three paragraphs of the U.S. draft reply to the Chinese Communist note.
                            The British Government suggested, however, that in the fourth sentence
                            of the fourth paragraph the words “has now rejected” be replaced by “has
                            not accepted.” They further suggested, with respect to the last sentence
                            of the draft reply, that there must be an opportunity to consider the
                            Communist reaction to the announcement the U.S. proposes the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command make in the Military Armistice
                            Commission, and proposed, therefore, that there should be further
                            consultation on the exclusion of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> teams from south Korea. In response to questions by
                            Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName>, the British Minister explained that his
                            Government concurs with the U.S. proposals except that after the
                            announcement in the Military Armistice Commission that the teams would
                            be removed from Korea, there should be an interval and consideration of
                            the Communist reaction before executing such action.</p>
                        <p>The Canadian Minister said that the Canadian Foreign Minister is now on
                            the way to Europe, and he had received only preliminary comment. The
                            Canadian Government agrees to the rejection of the conference proposal
                            on the grounds the U.S. proposes. The wording of the rejection probably
                            should be redrafted, however, to give a fuller statement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> objectives and to use a factual phrasing
                            with less temperature than the U.S. draft. With respect to the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, the Canadian Government is not yet
                            in a position to agree to the U.S. action. The employment of observers’
                            teams has been valuable in Korea and Indochina, and is a device we may
                            wish to use in the future. It is not suggested that the present
                            situation in Korea should go on indefinitely. In Indochina, however, the
                            observers’ teams will not be stabilized until a transfer is made in July
                            from French to Vietnamese authorities, and elections are held in
                            Vietnam. The Canadian Government, therefore, suggests we postpone the
                            Korean move, <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0279"/>which would have
                            undesirable repercussions, and try to solve the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> problem in gradual stages. First, we could urge the
                            Swiss and Swedes to accept the Chinese Communist proposal for the time
                            being, leaving one inspection team in each zone. Then we could propose
                            in the Military Armistice Commission a modification of the terms of
                            reference of the inspection teams. Later on, we could see to removing
                            the remaining team.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> asked confirmation by the Canadian
                            Minister of his understanding that the Canadian Government’s views
                            consisted primarily of a relation of the Korean situation to that in
                            Indochina and a recommendation that the suspension of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations be deferred. The Canadian
                            Minister agreed. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said that the U.S. sees
                            no necessary relationship between the Korea and Indochina situations,
                            and believes that the Korea case should be considered on its own merits.
                            The concept of a solution through stages of action in our opinion has
                            been overtaken by developments. We have tried hard with the Swiss and
                            Swedes. The Communists are giving us a run-around, and we want to stop
                            this merry-go-round.</p>
                        <p>The New Zealand Counselor said the New Zealand Government considered the
                            U.S. draft reply acceptable in its first three paragraphs. They
                            suggested, however, that the opening sentence of the third paragraph be
                            rewritten as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“In the absence of Communist willingness to negotiate on the
                                    basis of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> objectives, the
                                        <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem can and should
                                    be separated from the problem of unification.”</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>With respect to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, the New
                            Zealand Government is worried about the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command taking responsibility for the action. Despite
                            Communist violations, it is important we not expose ourselves to charges
                            of infringement of the agreement before all means are exhausted. New
                            Zealand suggests a strong statement of support for the Swiss and Swedish
                            proposals, which might encourage the Swiss and Swedes to withdraw, and
                            in any event would make <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command action
                            more palatable.</p>
                        <p>The French Minister asked whether we wished to support the Swiss or the
                            Swedish proposal. The French Government understood that the Swiss wished
                            to leave one inspection team in each zone. He was referred to the first
                            paragraph of the Communist note, which indicated some difference between
                            the Swiss and Swedish positions but agreement on withdrawal of all fixed
                            inspection teams to the Demilitarized Zone.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> asked whether the
                            New Zealand Government suggested approval of the Swiss and Swedish
                            proposals in a public statement or in a diplomatic note. The New Zealand
                            Counselor said that it should be published, but could be written into
                            this <pb n="252" xml:id="pg_252" facs="0280"/>note. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> pointed out that the Swiss
                            and Swedes have urged us not to issue statements associating them with
                            us in the Armistice problems, because of their desire to preserve their
                            neutral status. The New Zealand Counselor said we might explore the
                            possibility with the Swiss and Swedes. He said he interpreted his
                            instructions to indicate that the New Zealand Government reserved its
                            position on action by the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command
                            against the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The Australian Counselor said he had received only preliminary comment
                            from his Government. The Australian Government agreed with the first
                            three paragraphs of the U.S. draft reply, although believing they might
                            require some redrafting. On the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            issue, the Australian Government is anxious to avoid the appearance of
                            unilateral action, which would give the Communists good propaganda
                            material. We must make abundantly clear the Communist responsibility for
                            the breakdown. Tying action against the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> with rejection of the Communist conference proposal
                            makes it even more undesirable. The Australian Government suggests that
                            it is better to avoid in our reply any implication action will be taken
                            immediately in the Military Armistice Commission, and defer the action
                            until some later time. The Australian Counselor suggested rephrasing the
                            last paragraph of the draft reply to define the nature of Communist
                            responsibility for the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> questioned whether
                            we should load our reply with propaganda on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>, and referred to the contemplated statement in the
                            Military Armistice Commission and past statements we have made
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The French Minister said the French Government considered the U.S. draft
                            reply acceptable on the whole. They suggest a need for caution in our
                            action against the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> because of the
                            situation in Indochina, and that we avoid giving the impression that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command is violating the Armistice
                            Agreement. The French Government suggests the last paragraph of the U.S.
                            draft reply be written in more moderate language. A last approach to the
                            Swiss and Swedes also would be desirable. And finally, when action is
                            taken, it should be taken against the Swiss and Swedes as well as the
                            Czechs and Poles.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said that on the whole he was
                            disappointed by the response of the five governments. He said the U.S.
                            has been carrying the main burden in Korea, and has lived with the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem long enough. We do not
                            wish to go over old ground. We want to solve the problem and create a
                            cleaner situation in the Armistice. We are proposing not the abolition
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, but merely the provisional

                            He said he would like to reach closer agreement with the five countries
                            first before approaching the 16. The French Minister <pb n="253"
                                xml:id="pg_253" facs="0281"/>pointed out that the note had long been
                            in our hands, and that others of the 16 would be puzzled by the delay.
                            Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said, however, that he felt a further
                            brief delay would be worthwhile.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>McCardle</persName> of the Canadian Embassy inquired
                            concerning the legal grounds for the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command action, and was assured our legal case was well-based. Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> discussed analogies to contracts in
                            civil law. The British Minister expressed the view that the action was
                            legally well-based. Mr. <persName>McCardle</persName> said they would be
                            interested in our legal studies on such action. The French Minister
                            suggested we separate our reply into two parts, dealing first with the
                            conference and later with the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. The
                            British Minister said he felt this would play into the Communists’
                            hands. The French Minister suggested that we might make parallel
                            démarches to the Swiss and Swedes as we did in the past. Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> commented that they are concerned about
                            their neutral posture, and pressures will not help. The French Minister
                            suggested talking to them without pressures.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> said that today’s
                            meeting seemed to indicate that we are allowing the Communist note to do
                            exactly what was intended—to throw the Allied camp into confusion and
                            delay solution of the whole question of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss>. We all agreed this was the Communist purpose, and
                            failure to deal with the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> issue in
                            the reply would be to fall into the trap. Mr.
                                <persName>Sebald</persName> endorsed this statement. He suggested
                            another meeting of the same group should be held before a meeting of the
                            16, and Mr. <persName>Bond</persName> concurred. The time set for the
                            next meeting was 3:30 p.m., May 2.<note n="3" xml:id="d137fn3">The same

                            with previous efforts of Swiss. Swiss, as they indicated two years ago,
                            would like to have their task in <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            terminated but they were not prepared to wreck armistice (faire sauter

                            teams not abolished or stationed in demilitarized zones, Swiss would
                            withdraw. He appeared convinced that accepting proposal to reduce fixed
                            teams to one in north and one in south would constitute further step in

                            activities at considerable expense and ultimately result in inefficient,

                            to breakdown. Logistical system based on one port of entry would make
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> highly vulnerable in event
                            Communists renew hostilities with air attack. If U.S. continued some use

                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> obviously would demand frequent
                            inspections and moving teams would create more difficult problem than
                            present fixed teams. (2) For foregoing reasons U.S. would regard action
                            based on ChiCom proposal as unacceptable. (3) Since ChiComs instead of
                            replying to Swedes and Swiss addressed their latest proposal to 16, U.S.
                            sees no reason Swedes and Swiss associate themselves with unacceptable
                            ChiCom proposal before 16 have replied. (4) Urge Swiss and Swedes delay
                            action until 16 decide on reply. (5) We plan inform them of position of
                            16 before reply to ChiCom’s made.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_YCYD1">You</persName> asked whether the time has
                            not come when we should publicly announce that we will equip our forces
                            in Korea with the newest types of weapons, because of the impossibility
                            of supplying spare parts and maintenance for the older types.<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d140fn2">On May 2, President Eisenhower sent a memorandum to
                                Acting Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> in
                                which he solicited <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>’s
                                comments on a number of international problems, including Korea.
                                Eisenhower’s memorandum reads: “With respect to the military
                                disadvantages we are suffering in Korea because of the Armistice and
                                of our failure to have the Armistice Commission removed from Korea,
                                I wonder whether the time has not come when we should not [<hi

                                keeping our forces there equipped with the newest types of weapons,
                                because of the impossibility of supplying spare parts and
                                maintenance for the older types.” (<hi rend="italic"

                        <p>We think the time is near when this should be done. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> has said that July 1 is the
                            critical date. First, however, we have to solve the problem of the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its teams. The Department of
                            State is informing the other Governments participating in the United
                            Nations action in Korea on May 4 that the United Nations Command plans
                            to suspend provisionally those provisions of the Armistice relating to
                            the operations of the Supervisory Commission and its teams in the south
                            because of the flagrant Communist violations.<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d140fn3"><hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> Some of our
                            important allies with whom we have been consulting are not happy about
                            this course, and we have to make sure that our friends will be prepared
                            to support us when this action by the United Nations Command is
                            considered in the United Nations. Soon after the Neutral Nations
                            Inspection Teams are expelled from the area under the control of the
                            United Nations Command, it will be time, we think, to begin the
                            introduction of new weapons for our forces. We think this can be done as
                            a matter of interpretation of the Armistice Agreement in the light of
                            the actions of the other side. Since the international developments, and
                            in particular the reactions to our expulsion of the Neutral Nations
                            Inspection Teams, can not altogether be foreseen, we shall have to make
                            a final assessment of the situation before the introduction of new
                            weapons is begun.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> recalled that the group
                            had discussed the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem in 1954
                            after it became apparent that the Armistice might last indefinitely, and
                            again in 1955. At that time it was hoped the Swiss and Swedish members
                            of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> might negotiate a solution
                            with the Communists, although we recognized that their concern not to
                            jeopardize their neutrality made it unlikely that they would press <pb
                                n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0286"/>the Communists to agreement by
                            making clear their intention otherwise to withdraw. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that the only result thus
                            far of the Swiss-Swedish efforts was a reduction of the teams in each
                            zone from five to three, to which the <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> agreed in August 1955.<note n="2" xml:id="d141fn2">See
                                    <ref target="#d85">Document 85</ref>.</note> In October 1955 the
                            Swiss and Swedish members proposed removal of these three remaining

                                    target="#d89">Document 89</ref>.</note> but the proposal was
                            rejected by the Communists with the counterproposal in January 1956 that
                            the teams be reduced from three to one in each zone.<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d141fn4">See <ref target="#d111">Document

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> recalled the
                            demonstrations in the Republic of Korea last year against the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. The United States had successfully
                            persuaded the Republic of Korea to halt these demonstrations to
                            facilitate the Swiss-Swedish negotiations. However, he emphasized, the
                            Republic of Korea, directly affected by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> operations, could not be expected to bear with the
                            situation indefinitely. Moreover, the United States, as the Unified
                            Command, felt strongly action to eliminate the onerous inequity of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations could not be
                            postponed indefinitely.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> informed the group that
                            on April 9 the British Chargé in Peking had received a note from the
                            Chinese Communists addressed to the Sixteen,<note n="5" xml:id="d141fn5"
                                >See <ref target="#d131">Document 131</ref>.</note> copies of which
                            had already been distributed to them. This note was intended obviously
                            to halt negotiations on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. The
                            United States had prepared a draft reply,<note n="6" xml:id="d141fn6"
                                >Attached to <ref target="#d133">Document 133</ref>.</note> which
                            was circulated at the meeting, which rejected the Communist proposal for
                            a new conference on Korea but made clear our willingness to consider any
                            Communist proposals consistent with <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            objectives. The United Kingdom, he noted, was willing to transmit the
                            reply on behalf of the Sixteen.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> pointed out that the
                            draft reply, among other things, described the inequities of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> situation and stated that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> would announce its position in the
                                <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss>. He emphasized the importance of
                            dealing with this issue in our reply to the note.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> went on to say that we
                            now had information that the Swiss and Swedish members of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> had reached a firm decision not to
                            withdraw from the Commission without agreement of both sides, and that
                            they intended to accept the Communist proposal to reduce the teams to
                            one in each zone and permit this team to visit the other two ports of
                            entry as required. In his view these facts spoke for themselves as to
                            the practicality of any further approach to <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259"
                                facs="0287"/>the Swiss and Swedes other than to offer them a final
                            choice between withdrawing voluntarily now or doing so when the <gloss
                                target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> escorts the Czechs and Poles to the
                            Demilitarized Zone. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            explained that we had requested the Swiss and Swedes to delay their
                            reply to the Communists until after our consultations with the group.
                            However, we had already informed them that the Communist proposal would
                            be unacceptable to us because (a) it would not reduce our difficulties
                            and would create new problems; (b) there was no reason to believe that
                            the Communists would not continue to introduce matériel and personnel
                            without reference to the ports of entry provisions of the Armistice
                            Agreement; and (c) the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> would be
                            forced either to close all but one port of entry, at considerable
                            expense with the result a less efficient logistical system susceptible
                            to breakdown and highly vulnerable in the event of a Communist renewal
                            of hostilities with air attacks, or to be subjected to constant demands
                            for inspection of the other ports.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> informed the group that
                            the United States, at approximately the same time as the reply of the
                            Sixteen was delivered to the Chinese Communists, proposed that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> make a statement in the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> reciting the history of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem and the exhaustion of all
                            means to remedy it and announcing that it will no longer permit, as long
                            as the Communists are in default, activities of the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> within the territory under its
                            control. Therefore, the teams will be moved to the Demilitarized Zone
                            where they can continue to receive reports. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> stated that our action would be
                            based upon Communist violations and obstructions of the Armistice
                            Agreement, particularly its reporting and inspection provisions, and
                            will be stated to be a provisional suspension of our performance under
                            the provisions of the Armistice Agreement governing <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations in our area, while the
                            Communist side remains in default. In the view of the United States
                            these actions constituted legal relief to which we are entitled and was
                            the minimum necessary.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> recognized that those
                            present would wish to consult their respective governments. However, the
                            matter was urgent, and he suggested the group meet again May 9, at which
                            time he hoped they would have received instructions. He also noted the
                            possibility of press inquiries concerning the present meeting and
                            suggested that nothing be said beyond stating that the meeting was a
                            routine one to review the Armistice situation. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> requested any immediate
                            comments.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Hubert Graves</persName> (UK) asked whether the group
                            agreed it would be appropriate for a single note to be addressed to
                            Peking by the UK Chargé on behalf of the Sixteen. There was agreement on
                            this procedure. He noted another procedural problem arising on notes
                            addressed to the Chinese Communists. The United States draft referred

                            to the “Chinese Communists”. His Government’s experience was that, for
                            the note to be accepted, the reference must be to the “Government of the
                            People’s Republic of China”. In place of the reference to the “Communist
                            side” he proposed the phrase “the Chinese and the North Korean
                            side”.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> recognized these
                            problems, expressed tentative agreement with the British suggestions,
                            but noted the need to consider Taipei in this regard. He thought a
                            satisfactory form of words could be found without too much
                            difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Sir Hubert circulated to the group the attached summary of <gloss
                                target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss>’s views on the Chinese Communist
                                note.<note n="7" xml:id="d141fn7">Not printed. The note expressed
                                the British view that a conference on Korea “would clearly be
                                abortive and might do more harm than good”. In framing a reply to
                                the Chinese note, the British Government suggested that “it should
                                suggest a willingness to consider concrete proposals, provided there
                                is some indication of a readiness on the Chinese-North Korean side
                                to come towards the United Nations position”.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> inquired whether all
                            agreed there should be no conference. Mr. <persName>Baydur</persName>
                            (Turkey) expressed doubt that a conference would be helpful. Mr.
                                <persName>Muller</persName> (Belgium) concurred. Mr.
                                <persName>Glazebrook</persName> (Canada) likewise considered that a
                            conference would not be fruitful. Canada was concerned, however, by a
                            problem to which it had previously drawn attention, the possible
                            relationship between the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> and the
                            Control Commission in Indo-China, for which Canada had a certain
                            responsibility. Mr. <persName>Millet</persName> (France) also doubted
                            whether a conference would serve any useful purpose. At the same time he
                            noted two considerations regarding the proposed <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> action: its possible influence on the situation in
                            Indo-China, and the necessity of not giving the impression that the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> is violating the armistice and
                            of making clear that only a temporary suspension is involved. France, he
                            indicated, wished to see a last effort made in Bern and Stockholm to
                            persuade the Swiss and Swedes to leave, although he agreed with Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>’s comment that the
                            record showed no prospect for the success of such a move.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Han</persName> (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>)
                            expressed appreciation for Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName>’s comments regarding the forbearance of his
                            Government. He regarded the present situation as a very dangerous one;
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> objected strongly to the
                            continued presence of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in its
                            territory and opposed any further delay in achieving a solution.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked whether Mr.
                                <persName>Glazebrook</persName> or Mr. <persName>Millet</persName>
                            would elaborate on the possible relationship between the ICC in
                            Indo-China and the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. Mr.
                                <persName>Glazebrook</persName> suggested that similar principles
                            were involved. The situation in Viet-Nam was transitional and delicate.
                            The two armistices had been built up over a considerable period and
                            neither was 100 percent satisfactory. The issue was whether <pb n="261"
                                xml:id="pg_261" facs="0289"/>acting on the unsatisfactory aspects of
                            the Korean Armistice might tend to derogate from the support of the
                            other.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Muller</persName> stated that Belgium opposed any
                            unilateral action on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem
                            that appeared to depart from the Armistice Agreement. Mr.
                                <persName>Han</persName> rejoined that the real question was whether
                            we could permit one side to continue indefinitely to violate the
                            Armistice.</p>
                        <p>In reply to Mr. <persName>Muller</persName>’s question whether withdrawal
                            of the teams to the Demilitarized Zone implied complete liberty for the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> to do as it pleased, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> indicated that our
                            intention was to deal exclusively with the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> teams. He repeated that we proposed simply to suspend
                            provisionally our performance under the provisions of the Armistice
                            Agreement governing the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, while the
                            Communist side remains in default. As in all contracts this represented
                            the minimum relief to which we were legally entitled in the face of
                            continued deliberate violations by the other side.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>White</persName> (New Zealand) stated his Government agreed
                            a conference would serve no useful purpose. It also recognized the
                            unsatisfactory <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> situation, but he
                            was without instructions as to how this problem might be handled. He
                            asked whether by referring in the note to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> problem it was intended that all Sixteen would be
                            taking common responsibility not only for the note but also for the
                            proposed <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> action. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that all the governments
                            contributing to the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> would mutually
                            share the responsibility. The issue was one of mutual concern.</p>
                        <p><persName>Baron van Voorst</persName> (Netherlands) agreed that the
                            conference proposal should be rejected but questioned the proposed
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> action on the ground that some
                            kind of control should continue. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> pointed
                            out that our proposal involved merely suspension of the presence of the
                            teams in the south but retention of the existing system in principle.
                            Mr. <persName>Blakeney</persName> (Australia) likewise felt a conference
                            would not be useful but was concerned as to the methods and tactics on
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> inquired as to the planned timing and
                            asked specifically whether it was intended to remove the teams
                            simultaneously with the announcement in the <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss> or later. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> expressed the view that the actions should be
                            more or less concurrent but requested views on this point.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked again whether all
                            present agreed there should be no conference. Mr.
                                <persName>Calingo</persName> (Philippines) said he had received no
                            instructions. Mr. <persName>Cavalierato</persName> (Greece) stated that
                            his Government saw no point in a conference.</p>
                        <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0290"/>
                        <p>It was agreed to meet again May 9.<note n="8" xml:id="d141fn8">Minister
                                    <persName>Han</persName> remained after the meeting to tell
                                Sebald that he had instructions to inform the United States and the
                                members of the Sixteen that the Republic of Korea considered that
                                the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> should be dissolved, and
                                that the proposal to withdraw the <gloss target="#t_NNIT1"
                                    >NNIT</gloss>s to the demilitarized zone was, therefore,
                                unacceptable. Sebald sympathized with the point of view advanced by
                                Han, but he noted that anything beyond the solution proposed would
                                meet with “irrevocable opposition” among the Sixteen. (Memorandum of

                            Chinese Communist note of April 9, 1956 not only by rejecting the
                            proposed conference on Korean unification, but also by announcing in the
                            Military Armistice Commission that under the circumstances the United
                            Nations Command proposes provisionally to suspend performance of its
                            obligations to permit operations of the Neutral Nations Supervisory

                            would act with full regard for the provisions of the Armistice Agreement
                            and in reliance on the facts of Communist violations and obstruction. We

                            advisable to inform our Allies beforehand of our contemplated action in
                            view of its political implications. Since the international developments
                            cannot altogether be foreseen, we shall have, of course, to make a final
                            assessment of the situation before the introduction of new weapons is
                            undertaken.</p>

                            support for consultations Washington: (1) U.S. gratified Allies have
                            reached general consensus recognizing necessity <gloss target="#t_UNC1"
                                >UNC</gloss> action on <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            problem. (2) We see nothing to be gained and much to be risked in
                            piecemeal action. Single carefully planned action such as we propose
                            will of course bring Communist charges of violation of Armistice and
                            much protest and propaganda but these would be greatly magnified by
                            piecemeal action giving appearance of equivocation and indecisive-ness.
                            Communists would try arouse other governments who might well counsel us
                            against executing action and then be offended if we proceeded anyway.
                            Moreover once announcement had been made we would probably have no
                            alternative but proceed in end regardless re action under greater
                            difficulties. We have been assessing situation almost three years now
                            and if we are all agreed action necessary <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266"
                                facs="0294"/>seems clear this is one of those situations where you
                            can act or do nothing but are lost if you act indecisively.</p>

                            indefinite.</p>
                        <p>Note that U.S. is proposing provisional suspension <gloss
                                target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> performance of certain provisions
                            Armistice while Communists remain in default.</p>
                        <p>For Wellington and Paris and use at discretion by other posts: Swiss and
                            Swedes never willing confront Communists with alternative their
                            withdrawal and thus have no hope securing Communist agreement. They
                            willing accept Communist suggestion reduce to one team. We deeply
                            appreciative their efforts but consider further approaches useless.
                            However we keeping Swiss and Swedes informed generally our consultations
                            and when course action definitely agreed we would inform them beforehand
                            giving them alternative of acting themselves.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador Boheman, who came in at his suggestion, said that he had just
                            returned from Stockholm. He had been startled upon arriving there to
                            find that the Swedish and Swiss Governments were proposing to accept the
                            Communist proposal to reduce the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to one
                            in each zone. He had been instrumental in persuading the Foreign Office
                            that this was not a good idea and he was quite sure that this idea had
                            now been dropped. He could assure the Department of State that no reply
                            to the Communists would be made until the Sixteen had replied to the
                            Chinese Communist note. If he understood the situation correctly, that
                            reply <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0295"/>would be negative on the
                            question of a conference and would indicate that the participating
                            nations were not content with the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>
                            situation. He thought, the Ambassador continued, that this would put the
                            Swedish Government in position to renew the proposal that the teams be
                            withdrawn altogether to the Demilitarized Zone, and he was personally of
                            opinion that the Communists would then accept this proposal.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked what reason
                            there was to believe that the Communists would accept this proposal,
                            since they had not done so in the past and it was difficult to see what
                            would impel them to do so now. The Ambassador said that there had been a
                            conversation with <persName>Chou En-lai</persName> and the new Swedish
                            Ambassador in Peiping in connection with the Chinese Communist note to
                            the Sixteen, and while there may have been some problems of translation
                            of what was said, the substance of it seemed to be that <persName>Chou
                                En-lai</persName> had said he realized that the conference proposal
                            would probably be rejected and that if that happened, the Chinese
                            Communists would have to consider what to do next. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that our information
                            from Bern and from Stockholm had been that the Swiss and Swedish
                            Governments were definitely unwilling to say that they would withdraw
                            from the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission if the proposal to
                            withdraw the teams to the Demilitarized Zone was not accepted. The
                            Ambassador confirmed that his Foreign Office remained unwilling to go
                            that far.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> referred to the
                            recent conversation between Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> and Count

                            Count <persName corresp="#p_MADII1">Douglas</persName> had been informed
                            that the United States had placed a proposal before the Sixteen that the
                            United Nations Command announce in the Military Armistice Commission the
                            provisional suspension of the operation of the provisions of the
                            Armistice relating to the activities of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> in our zone. Ambassador Boheman professed ignorance of
                            this proposal and said that if this were done it would, of course, end
                            the matter so far as his Government was concerned. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> raised the question whether
                            knowledge through press sources that such a proposal was made might lead
                            the Communists to accept the Swiss and Swedish proposals to withdraw to
                            the Demilitarized Zone. He pointed out that there had been a report in a
                            Zurich newspaper that the United States had proposed unilateral action
                            to the Sixteen and that the Communists might have picked up this
                            information. The Ambassador commented that it was not certain what the
                            Communist reaction would be, that it might be against accepting the
                            Swiss and Swedish proposals in that case.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador mentioned that when he was in Stockholm he had brought
                            personally to the attention of the Foreign Minister a little book
                            published by a Swedish member of the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams,
                            which had graphically described the precautions which it had been
                            necessary for the United Nations Command to take in protecting the
                            members of the teams.</p>

                            order to achieve as great a unanimity as possible on the proposed <gloss

                            between the announcement and the action. We interpreted a “few days” to
                            mean seven. Also in accord with the desires of the United Kingdom we
                            would make available to the Sixteen the report of the Military Armistice
                            Commission meeting immediately and the time interval would run from the
                            receipt of this report. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> expressed the
                            hope that all of this was satisfactory to the British and suggested that
                            Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> might talk to the Commonwealth countries
                            prior to the next meeting of the Sixteen and endeavor to obtain their
                            concurrence also.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> confirmed that our proposed course of
                            action was acceptable and said he would do his best to bring along the
                            Commonwealth, but could not, of course, guarantee agreement by all of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Youde</persName> asked whether as a matter of mechanics the
                            Military Armistice Commission report would be circulated before or at a
                            meeting of the Sixteen. Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> agreed that the
                            report could be distributed to the interested embassies as soon as
                            received in the Department and that then a meeting of the Sixteen could
                            be called three or four days later to discuss it. This would permit the
                            embassies to get in touch with their governments.</p>
                        <pb n="270" xml:id="pg_270" facs="0298"/>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Hubert</persName> asked whether we expected him to talk to
                            the French also, and Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> agreed that he
                            should appropriately limit himself to the Commonwealth countries.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> then raised the question of our reply to
                            the Chinese Communist April 9 note, and said that we had two ideas and
                            in both had incorporated the Australian suggestions. The reply could
                            consist of our original draft, plus the Australian paragraphs and refer
                            to the Communists and north Koreans as “Communists” or could take the
                            form of a British note replying on behalf of the United Nations Command.
                            Sir Hubert said that his Government was also prepared to support the
                            Australian suggestions or their amalgamation into our draft and that his
                            Embassy had also prepared several alternatives. He then passed copies of
                            the British and Australian drafts.<note n="3" xml:id="d147fn3">Not found
                                attached.</note> The British draft took the form of a short covering

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> said that at first glance he liked the
                            British form, but that we would naturally desire an opportunity to go
                            over both drafts prior to a meeting of the drafting committee.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that an attempt would be made to set up a meeting with the
                            drafting committee at 2:30, May 23,<note n="4" xml:id="d147fn4">The

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> described the current
                            status of discussions with the fifteen powers participating in the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command. He said that agreement to
                            the withdrawal of the neutral teams from South Korea had been reached
                            but that there had been some difference over the time interval to be
                            permitted between the announcement in the Military Armistice Commission
                            and the actual removal of the teams. At a meeting on May 25 the U.S.
                            believes that it will get general agreement to a seven-day interval.
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented that
                            this seemed to be all right; it would give the neutral teams time to
                            pack their clothes at least. He asked whether General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> and the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> are being kept informed. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that an <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> representative has been attending the
                            meetings in Washington and that General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> is being kept informed by telegram.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> inquired about
                            Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement, noting that we are taking
                            great risks because we are not able to keep the military efficiency of
                            our forces in Korea at the necessary level. The Admiral suggested that
                            perhaps we could get the Japanese to agree to lengthen runways in Japan
                            if we could tell them that we were in a position to pull our air forces
                            out and send them to Korea. He noted that General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> feels July 1 is the target date
                            for favorable action on Article 13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said he thought it
                            would be inadvisable to raise this matter with the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> group. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> agreed and said that he
                            thought the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> commander in the field
                            should take the necessary action as a military matter and that the
                            subject of 13(d) should not be raised formally with other <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> representatives. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> agreed and said we might use the
                            theory that time had overtaken <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0300"
                            />this aspect of the agreement. He added that the possibility exists
                            that the communists might denounce the Korean Armistice Agreement if we
                            should take any formal action on Article 13(d). Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that he did not think
                            this would be the result if we went ahead and brought in military
                            equipment as necessary. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1"
                                >Murphy</persName> agreed that it would probably not be advisable to
                            make reports of new equipment brought in to Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> said the Department
                            would look into the problem of Article 13(d).</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> referred to a report received from
                            the British Chargé at Peiping over the week end indicating that the
                            Chinese Communists were now ready to accept the Swedish proposal,
                            namely, that the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> be withdrawn to
                            the Demilitarized Zone, but that mobile inspection teams continue to
                            operate on request in both north and south Korea. From today’s press
                            reports it appeared that the Communists had in fact made this proposal
                            in the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting early today.<note

                                statement, the <gloss target="#t_KPACPV1">KPA/CPV</gloss>
                                representative denied responsibility for the difficulties
                                experienced by the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>, ascribed

                                Armistice Agreement, and demanded that the announcement be
                                withdrawn. In the charge and countercharge that followed, the KPA/
                                CPV representative also noted that his “side” was prepared to accede
                                to the proposal made by Sweden in March to withdraw the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s to the demilitarized zone, while
                                reserving the right to despatch mobile teams as needed. General
                                    <persName corresp="#p_GGRG1">Gard</persName> rejected this

                            this were the case, his Government considered this a “most satisfactory
                            outcome”. On instructions from the Foreign Office, Mr. <persName>de la
                                Mare</persName> stated that his Government desired us to authorize
                            the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command to accept in principle the
                            Communist proposal, to take no action to expel the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams from south Korea, and to begin
                            negotiations within the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> toward the
                            withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> to the
                            Demilitarized Zone and toward provision for the future operation of
                            mobile teams. Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> repeated that until
                            all of this was explored his Government hoped that the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command would take no further action
                            toward removing the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. From today’s
                            press reports Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> gave as his opinion
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_GGRG1">Gard</persName> had rejected
                            the Communist compromise “out of hand” and had placed us “on the hook”
                            since in our reply to their <pb n="276" xml:id="pg_276" facs="0304"
                            />April 9 note we had said that we supported the Swedish proposals. Now
                            a few days later we were rejecting them.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName> in reply stated
                            that Communist acceptance of the old Swedish proposals did not cure the
                            defect with respect to the operation of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> and its teams which was the primary reason for our
                            action. That action consisted of provisionally suspending <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> operations in south Korea until such
                            time as the Communist default had been rectified. Accordingly, if press
                            reports were accurate General <persName corresp="#p_GGRG1"
                                >Gard</persName> acted correctly since anything else he might have
                            done would have greatly weakened our position with respect to the
                            Communist defective performance.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that further consideration of the situation must await an
                            accurate report of today’s <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> meeting
                            and, in particular, a report of the true substance of the Communist
                            proposal. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HN1">Hemmendinger</persName>
                            suggested that the Sixteen meet as scheduled tomorrow at which time the
                            report from Panmunjom should have been received.</p>

                                article by Anthony Leviero was run under the headline “Korea Arms
                                Curb Held Unfair to U.S.” Leviero pointed out that Pentagon
                                officials were concerned about the deteriorating position of the
                                U.N. Command in Korea, hampered by the provisions of the Armistice

                            difficult.</p>
                        <p>As Defense has advised the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>, our plan
                            regarding obsolescence has been to authorize replacement on the theory
                            that paragraph 13 (d) does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> require the
                            strained construction that “same” type and effectiveness means identical
                            designation, vintage, and absolute qualities. In construing paragraph 13
                            (d) in accordance with the purposes and aims of the Armistice Agreement
                            and with regard for the practical construction put on it by the other
                            side, we can act lawfully and with a proper regard for our
                            responsibilities as a nation that respects the law and its own
                            promises.</p>
                        <p>I do not know that measures you can or might wish to recommend to the
                            Secretary or Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> regarding
                            the Leviero story, and, more fundamentally, Defense’s penchant for
                            defying the law and the sensibilities of our allies; it must be borne in
                            mind that both sides can violate an agreement, and that reinvocation of
                            the protected sanctuary argument is not likely to win a case in the
                            United Nations General Assembly.</p>
                        <p>In short, the legal implications of the situation are that unless Defense
                            and State immediately agree to abide by the previously projected U.S.
                            position on full reporting and a reasonable and conscientious
                            interpretation and application of Article 13 (d), the United States will
                            have been guilty of violating the Korean Armistice by measures going
                            well beyond any mere suspended performance warranted by past Communist
                            violations. If Defense considers this an incorrect reading of the law,
                            it would be possible to put the question to the International Court of
                            Justice for advisory opinion, as the General Counsel’s Office of Defense
                            itself suggested regarding the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>,
                            although I would question the propriety of considering the <gloss

                            difference when there is an excellent chance in the present situation of
                            having our actions soundly criticized by that tribunal.</p>
                        <p>I attach in the form of a draft letter a suggestion of the position we
                            should take with Defense.<note n="4" xml:id="d156fn4">Not printed. The

                            which purports to state the views of the Department of Defense on the
                            Armistice Agreement in Korea, and particularly the problem of
                            obsolescence of weapons.</p>
                        <p>I am concerned about the central thesis of this article that the
                            Armistice Agreement precludes the replacement of obsolete material and
                            that therefore the United States should not slavishly observe the terms
                            of the truce. This view is not in accord with the views of the
                            Departments of Defense and State, as set forth in a telegram to <gloss

                                    >footnote 4, Document 110</ref>.</note> stating that the problem
                            of obsolescence can be met by a reasonable and conscientious
                            construction of the Armistice Agreement. Acting Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> restated this view in

                        <p>It is important that the Departments of State and Defense follow a
                            consistent line, and make publicly clear that the United Nations Command
                            will continue to observe the Armistice Agreement and that we believe the
                            problem of obsolescence of equipment can be met within the terms of the
                            Armistice Agreement. It is suggested that officers of our two
                            Departments state the United States’ position accordingly in background
                            briefings of the press or in response to questions.</p>
                        <p>The Department of State will be prepared to consult soon with the
                            Department of Defense upon the timing of the introduction of new types
                            of weapons as agreed to in our letter of May 5, and we will have to
                            consider further at that time our public position with respect to the

                                important to follow a consistent line in dealing with the press and
                                indicated that the appropriate offices in the Department of Defense
                                would be instructed to adhere to the view that “the resolution of
                                the problem of obsolescence can be accomplished legally within the
                                terms of paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement as a matter of
                                interpretation of the Agreement in the light of the actions of the
                                other side.” He added that the Department of Defense would be
                                prepared early in July to indicate the type and number of new
                                weapons to be introduced into South Korea and to draft joint

                        <p>After an exchange of amenities, General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> said that he had wanted to come in to express
                            his appreciation to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            for the Department’s long efforts and final success in obtaining
                            agreement on the part of the 16 nations included in the United Nations
                            command in Korea to the removal of the neutral nations inspection teams
                            from the territory of the Republic of Korea. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> expressed satisfaction over
                            the smooth manner in which the actual removal of the teams had been
                            accomplished and spoke of the great pleasure which this action had given
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and the Korean
                            Government. General agreement was expressed that the action had been
                            accomplished with a minimum of adverse comment from other nations and
                            that not even the Chinese Communists had made any great efforts to
                            exploit the issue.</p>
                        <p>Now that that phase of the problem has been accomplished, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> said that he
                            wanted to talk about his difficulties under Section 13(d) of the
                            armistice agreement with respect to the introduction of new equipment.
                            He said that, as the commanding general responsible for the military
                            security of the area, he is in a most difficult position with respect to
                            obsolete material and equipment. He is prevented from bringing in
                            up-to-date equipment due to <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0314"/>our
                            strict interpretation of and adherence to the armistice agreement. He
                            simply is not able to ensure the necessary protection for the area. He
                            declared that he is making every effort to avoid inappropriate publicity
                            and unauthorized statements with respect to the introduction of new
                            equipment but that he would very much like to know the Department’s
                            present position and possible changes with respect to action under
                            Section 13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> replied that there had
                            been no decision on this as yet by the Secretary of State. He continued
                            that the matter is under active study by the Legal Adviser, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>, but that no final
                            decision has been reached as to the Department’s position. There
                            followed a discussion as to our present method of reporting to the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> under Section 13(d), and it
                            was suggested that perhaps our reporting in the past has been over
                            meticulous. Instead of reporting on each type of aircraft with respect
                            to the specific model, for instance, it might be possible to merely
                            report a new bomber replacing a worn-out bomber and a new fighter in
                            place of an old fighter rather than getting into the details of an F–86D
                            for an F–86B. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName>
                            suggested that, after all, the “Honest <persName>John</persName>” is in
                            essence an advanced artillery development and perhaps a new system could
                            be devised which would merely report so much new artillery replacing
                            artillery being retired. There was further discussion of the
                            desirability of greater flexibility in reporting under Section 13(d),
                            assuming we would continue to honor this clause of the armistice, and
                            Mr. <persName>McGuire</persName> agreed to address a letter<note n="2"

                        <p>“To analyze the present strengths and weaknesses of the North Korean
                            regime and to estimate future developments and trends over the next few
                            years.</p>
                        <p rend="center">“Conclusions</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>“1. The Korean Communist regime will almost certainly retain firm
                                control of North Korea through 1960, and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> will probably retain its
                                predominant influence over North Korea’s internal and external
                                policies. Communist China probably will continue to make a
                                substantial economic contribution to North Korea and its military
                                forces will continue to be available for the defense of North Korea.
                                Although Communist China will continue to play an important part in
                                the formulation of Bloc policy toward North Korea, we believe it
                                will not attempt to dislodge the <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                    >USSR</gloss> as the dominant power there. (Paras. 50–51)</item>
                            <item>“2. The objective of the Communists continues to be the gaining of
                                control over the entire Korean peninsula. We believe that they will
                                not resort to force to obtain this objective, at least so long as
                                the US remains committed to the defense of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. However, the Communists will
                                continue their attempts to undermine the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> through overt and covert political, diplomatic,
                                economic, and propaganda appeals to South Korea for economic,
                                political, and cultural contacts, and for ‘Korean’ measures to bring
                                about unification. We believe that in present circumstances the
                                Communists will probably not make substantial progress in these
                                efforts. However, either in the event of the death of <persName
                                    corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> or a decline in US economic and
                                military support, their unification tactics are likely to be
                                accelerated and much more effective. (Paras. 53–54)</item>
                            <item>“3. The Communists will probably continue to press for the
                                withdrawal of <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>/US forces, and for
                                international negotiations on Korean unification, but they almost
                                certainly will not make any concessions which would weaken their
                                firm hold on North Korea. In fact they would probably accept serious
                                military risks to maintain their position. (Paras. 52–53)</item>
                            <item>“4. Despite reductions in over-all strength since the Armistice,
                                Communist armed forces in Korea could still launch a limited attack
                                with little warning. The Chinese Communists will continue to have
                                the unopposed capability to reinforce units in contact along the
                                demarcation line with a maximum of six armies in from 10 to 14 days
                                after the initiation of movement from present assembly areas. North
                                Korean armed forces now include a re-equipped and reorganized army
                                of some 350,000 men and an air force with 310 jet fighters <pb
                                    n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0316"/>(Fagots) and 65 light jet
                                bombers (Beagles). Although the North Korean ground force is well
                                below the strength of the 650,000-man <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> army and may undergo a strength reduction of 80,000
                                this year, North Korean air force strength is far superior to that
                                of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. (Paras. 40, 42,
                                48–49)</item>
                            <item>“5. The Chinese Communists have steadily reduced their troop
                                strength in Korea and now have less than 300,000 men in the area.
                                The chances are about even that Chinese Communists will complete the
                                withdrawal of their troops within the next year or so in order to
                                enhance the independent appearance of the North Korean regime and to
                                increase pressure on the US/<gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                command to complete its withdrawal. However, the Chinese Communists
                                may wish to retain some troops in North Korea in order to maintain
                                political influence in the area and a rough parity of ground force
                                strength with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d159fn1">The Special Assistant, Intelligence, Department
                                    of State, believes that the factors impinging on a Chinese
                                    Communist military withdrawal from Korea are so uncertain as to
                                    make it impossible to estimate that the chances are about even
                                    that complete withdrawal will occur within the next year or so.
                                    Although such a move would conform with the Communists’ current
                                    ‘peaceful’ pose, such factors as Chinese Communist interest in
                                    maintaining influence in North Korea, Chinese Communist
                                    commitment of military labor in Korea as a contribution to North
                                    Korean rehabilitation, possible Soviet uneasiness about the
                                    strength of the North Korean forces at this stage of
                                    development, and the desirability of timing a military
                                    withdrawal in such a way as to gain maximum political advantage
                                    may militate against complete withdrawal in the immediate
                                    future.” [Footnote in the source text.]</note> (Paras. 44,

                            <item>“6. Although living standards remain extremely low in North Korea,
                                rehabilitation of the severely damaged industrial and agricultural
                                industries is well advanced. With substantial material and manpower
                                assistance from the Bloc, industrial output is rising and will
                                probably reach 1949 levels in most sectors by the end of 1956. By
                                1961 the North Korean economy will probably be able to make a modest
                                contribution to the Bloc’s economic potential in the Far East in the
                                fields of metals, chemicals, and electric power. However, a serious
                                manpower shortage, lagging production in agriculture, and lack of
                                adequate consumer goods industry will continue beyond 1956 to hamper
                                efforts to raise living standards and to increase the regime’s

                                <item>The Foreign Office sympathized with our anxiety over the

                                <item>The Foreign Office accepted a year ago the necessity for
                                    introducing new equipment provided it were carried out with
                                    maximum discretion.</item>

                                    was feared, however, that any introduction of new equipment at

                                    the Foreign Office thought it advisable to wait several months
                                    and to take every possible step to assure the minimum

                                    Sixteen would inevitably result in “leaks” the Foreign Office
                                    preferred that the Sixteen not be approached in advance.</item>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> confirmed that the
                            problem of new equipment is being actively studied and assured Mr.
                                <persName>de la Mare</persName> that when action was taken it would
                            be done in the most natural possible way. He said that the military were
                            also in agreement that no publicity would be given.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_NDG1">Nes</persName> said that he really did
                            not feel a problem of timing now existed since a month had already
                            passed since the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> action and
                            additional time would be required before equipment would actually arrive
                            in Korea even though a firm decision were taken in the near future.</p>
                        <p>With regard to consulting with the Sixteen Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> said that we were studying this
                            question also, and that two factors were involved. First our natural
                            desire is to keep this a United Nations operation and accordingly to
                            bring the Sixteen in on any new steps; secondly, the likelihood and
                            danger of leaks were the Sixteen consulted.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> then raised the matter of reporting
                            the recent <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> action to the United
                            Nations. If our report is to be purely factual, the Foreign Office have
                            no views to express. However, if the report were likely to stimulate
                            United Nations debate, the British would like an opportunity to comment
                            on the draft. Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> said he thought the
                            submission of a report was likely to raise all sorts of questions and
                            both the Foreign Office and the British United Nations Delegation
                            suggested that its submission be delayed for several months.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> asked whether this
                            would not in fact tend to highlight the report and encourage United
                            Nations debate since it would be received that much closer to the
                            meeting of the General Assembly. In any event we would be asking for the
                            advice of our United Nations Delegation both on the text of the report
                            and on the time of its submission.</p>
                        <p>In leaving, Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> asked whether the
                            introduction of new equipment might not encourage President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> in his desire to unify Korea by
                            force. He wondered whether the United States could control <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>.</p>
                        <p>In reply Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> said that one
                            should look at the record of the past three or four years from which it
                            would appear that <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would not
                            take any precipitate action and that the receipt of new equipment would
                            not be expected to upset the present status quo.</p>

                        <p>The despatch summarizes our commitment in Korea and the consequences of
                            failure to meet our responsibilities. Korea is characterized as “a
                            nation adrift, whose people are disillusioned and uninspired”. The
                            Communist danger, it is pointed out, remains as a potential danger which
                            “increases day by day as President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> and his Government fail to offer believable
                            national goals …”.<note n="5" xml:id="d161fn5">Ellipsis in the source

                        <p>In discussing President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s role
                            a number of weaknesses in his policies are exposed and it is said that
                            he “thus far seems to be ignorant of, or has failed to understand, the
                            public dissatisfaction manifested in the election”.<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d161fn6">See <ref target="#d146">Document 146</ref>.</note>
                            “In sum, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s role in
                            domestic affairs since 1948 has achieved the short-range goal of
                            preserving order, but he has not furnished the country the constructive
                            leadership necessary for the development of a viable society and
                            therefore for the achievement of American objectives in Korea”.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the despatch states “we must continue to support President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> while he lives,” but must
                            also demonstrate to him the “overriding importance of a constructive
                            national program”. We must recognize that in addition to being an
                            expression of popular dissatisfaction the May election was “also a major
                            political overturn” which could lead to the Opposition’s inheriting
                            power. Continued support of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            military as a stabilizing force in domestic affairs is required.</p>
                        <p>There is little new in the despatch and it does not show us any clear way
                            out of our Korean dilemma, but it does point up, as did the <persName

                            and courses of action in Korea can best be described as one of

                                <item>It appears to us that one of the most significant factors in
                                    our difficulties in moving ahead in Korea is the point which you
                                    make at the bottom of page 3, where you say “Korea does not have
                                    the heritage of a working economic system”. This is complicated
                                    for the United States in trying to work with the Koreans to
                                    think through the necessary stages of development planning,
                                    since there is little in history which bears on the problem in
                                    question. South Korea as an independent political and economic
                                    entity is new in the history of Korea. Consequently, it is not
                                    possible to depend to any great extent upon past events in
                                    arriving at conclusions with respect to the most logical future
                                    course. It seems to us that it is this phenomenon as much as any
                                    other that precludes the Korean officials themselves from being
                                    very helpful, even with the best of working relationships
                                    between the United States and the Republic of Korea, in
                                    providing ideas of maximum usefulness to the United States in
                                    our own planning.</item>

                                <item>At the bottom of page 4 you say that “the potential danger,

                                    Government fail to offer believable national goals, and to put

                                    It is on this very point where the greater knowledge of

                                    Americans should prove most helpful in working with the Koreans
                                    to blueprint jointly the kind of goals which are most needed in

                                    relations with the Koreans that we have not been able to turn

                                    the Koreans to develop national goals. It seems to us that the
                                    Korean people possess an element of strength, which enabled them
                                    to maintain their ethnic identity during many centuries of

                        <p>On August 15, the Representative at the United Nations conveyed to the
                            Secretary-General a report submitted by the Unified Command on the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea. Attached to the report
                            were the text of the note received by the British Chargé in Beijing on
                            April 9, the text of the note delivered by the British Chargé in Beijing
                            on May 28, and copies of the statements made by the U.N. Representative
                            in the Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom on July 5, 1955, July
                            14, 1955, and May 31, 1956.</p>
                        <p>The report by the Unified Command presented the decision taken on May 31
                            to provisionally suspend the performance of those provisions of the
                            Armistice Agreement governing the operations of the Neutral Nations
                            Supervisory Commission as a “remedial step” taken by “one party to a
                            contract with certain provisions of which the other party has failed to
                            comply”. The suspension would last, the report emphasized, “during the
                            time the Communist side continued in default”. The Command took note of
                            the Chinese proposal of April 9 to treat the problem of the Neutral
                            Nations Supervisory Commission as an aspect of the overall problems of
                            the unification of Korea and the withdrawal of foreign forces from
                            Korea, but dismissed <pb n="300" xml:id="pg_300" facs="0328"/>the
                            suggestion as an attempt “to close negotiations for solution of the
                            Neutral Nations Supervisory problem”. Under the circumstances, the
                            United Nations Command argued that it “was left with no alternative but
                            to assert its rights”. The report and attachments were circulated to the
                            General Assembly on August 16 as U.N. doc. A/3167.</p>

                                respond to his question about possible sanctuary.
                                    <persName>Jones</persName> told <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1"
                                    >Chang</persName> that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                    >Dowling</persName>, while sympathetic, did not believe that

                                presently in danger. <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>
                                also felt, <persName>Jones</persName> told <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName>, that <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName>’s political career would be
                                irreparably damaged by an attempt to seek refuge in an American
                                installation, and that the position of the United States in Korea
                                would also be damaged. <persName>Jones</persName> assured the Vice
                                President, however, that if a genuine threat to his life developed,
                                the United States would not be indifferent and would exert influence
                                to try to prevent such a development.</note> Some two weeks before
                            the inauguration Bill was asked by Dr. <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1"
                                >Chang</persName> if he would be his contact with the Embassy.</p>

                        <p>As you will find on reading the memoranda, the Vice President is quite
                            concerned for his personal safety. He feels that the Liberal Party is
                            determined to remove him from the scene. The Vice President attributes
                            no small part of his difficulty to an unfortunate article which appeared
                            on August 16 and was based on an exclusive interview which Jack Boyer of
                            United Press had with the Vice President. (Our Despatch No. 66 of August
                            30 deals with this article as well as with the Vice President’s
                            inaugural statement.)<note n="4" xml:id="d166fn4">In despatch 66 from
                                Seoul, the Embassy reported on <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang
                                    Myon</persName>’s inauguration statements of August 15.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName> was not given an
                                opportunity to deliver his address at the inauguration ceremony so
                                he released it through the Office of Public Information. The
                                statement was critical of the South Korean domestic situation but
                                emphasized a desire for cooperation in the national interest.
                                    <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName> expanded upon his
                                inaugural statement in an interview the same day with Jack Boyer of
                                United Press. According to Boyer’s report, <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName> planned to “speak out” in
                                his drive to make the Republic of Korea more democratic, to act
                                independently of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> on domestic matters, to seek normalization of
                                relations with Japan, to “keep a sharp eye” on inefficiency in
                                government, and, in his role as “spokesman of the people,” to
                                apprise the President of “the true state of affairs” and to offer
                                “constructive suggestions” as needed. The Boyer article appeared in
                                the Seoul press on August 17, and the Embassy reported that it
                                prompted fierce denunciation of the Vice President in the National
                                Assembly and in pro-government newspapers. (Department of State,
                                Central Files, 795B.12/8–3056)</note> The Vice President has asked
                            for our assurances that we would provide him sanctuary within American
                            installations if things became worse and he felt he was in imminent
                            danger of assassination. This request, as the Vice President himself
                            recognized, posed a difficult problem for us. To provide him sanctuary,
                            even if this were possible, would lead to the most obvious
                            interpretations or mis-interpretations by the President and Liberal
                            Party leaders.</p>
                        <p>While we in the Embassy could not say categorically that the Vice
                            President is in no danger, we do believe that it is quite unlikely that
                            an organized attempt would be made to assassinate him at least as long
                            as there are other and legal means of preventing his succession to the
                            presidency. The amendment to the Constitution certainly remains a
                            distinct possibility. Accordingly, I asked Bill to make the statement to
                            the Vice President contained in the first paragraph of the Memorandum of
                            Conversation held on September 1, 1956. This seems to me to be the best
                            procedure at present, and I believe the Vice President fully appreciates
                            our problem although he undoubtedly would like a more positive
                            solution.</p>
                        <p>If the Department has objections to this course of action or has
                            alternative courses of action to suggest, I would appreciate your
                            sending them on to me as soon as possible.<note n="5" xml:id="d166fn5"

                        <p>Defense concurrence with this view was contained in Mr.

                                >Radford</persName> is therefore contrary to the understandings
                            previously reached between State and Defense on this question and would
                            constitute a violation of the Armistice Agreement. It would maximize the
                            adverse repercussions among our Allies and provide the Communists with
                            the greatest possible propaganda ammunition. In addition were we to
                            commence the introduction of modern equipment for U.S. forces without
                            some similar provision with respect to <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces, very considerable adverse political
                            repercussions can be expected in Korea.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> interrupted to say that in
                            his opinion four major and very basic issues were at stake and should be
                            dealt with: (1) Do we suspend paragraph 13(d) or introduce new equipment
                            under a liberal interpretation; (2) do we report the new items or not;
                            (3) do we proceed with the introduction of new equipment immediately or
                            do we ask for the views of General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> and Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"

                            <pb n="306" xml:id="pg_306" facs="0334"/>first; and (4) what do we do
                            about [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]?</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> contended that
                            the entire question was a matter of reducing the cost of our military
                            commitment in Korea, and that this could only be done by modernizing the
                            forces there to include weapons of atomic capability.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            State and Defense had already agreed that new weapons would be
                            introduced through an interpretation of paragraph 13(d) and that they
                            would be reported to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>. State
                            had also supported the replacement of obsolete and worn out equipment
                            with roughly equivalent items. The question raised by Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> was thus “Are we to implement
                            policy already agreed upon or are we to set a new policy”?.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> stated that he
                            was not familiar with the policy outlined by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> with respect to
                            interpretation and reporting, considered such a policy entirely
                            unsatisfactory, and firmly believed that if such were the policy it
                            should be changed. The Admiral maintained that it was impossible to do
                            what had to be done under an interpretation of paragraph 13(d), and that
                            so long as we were committed to replacing weapons with their
                            equivalents, we could not reduce either the Korean forces or the
                            American contingent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> gave as his opinion that
                            we could do what we wanted to through a liberal interpretation of
                            paragraph 13(d) and by reporting in general terms.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> proceeded to read
                            from the August 15 Unified Command Report to the United Nations<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d168fn5">See <ref target="#d164">Document
                                164</ref>.</note> and from Secretary McGuire’s letter to Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> of June 27,<note n="6"
                                xml:id="d168fn6">See <ref target="#d157fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                    157</ref>.</note> both of which he stated reflected Defense
                            agreement with State on the basic questions involved.</p>
                        <p>Saying that the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had never considered
                            the exchange of correspondence with State satisfactory, Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> contended that the
                            policy was not definitive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> asked whether there was
                            anything inconsistent in the list of proposed weapons with the previous
                            policy decision, and it was agreed that this question would have to be
                            determined by Defense and State lawyers.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reviewed State’s
                            position and contended that we had always thoroughly recognized the
                            intolerable situation created in Korea by Communist violations of the
                            Armistice Agreement and that our purpose had been to find a formula for
                            achieving a balance with the Communists while avoiding the onus of
                            breaking the Armistice Agreement. We would, therefore, be very reluctant
                            to take any <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0335"/>action which would
                            manifestly subject the U.S. to legitimate charges of having broken the
                            Armistice.</p>
                        <p>In maintaining that the time had come for a new policy. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that the removal of the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> was only the first step
                            required and that the second was logically a suspension of paragraph
                            13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> reiterated his view that
                            perhaps the necessary action could be accomplished through an
                            interpretation of paragraph 13(d) and said he was convinced that any
                            agreement Defense had in the matter with State excluded any bar to [<hi

                            declassified</hi>]. Accordingly, if State’s interpretation of the policy

                        <p>After Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had read a

                                Forces and Equipment in Korea,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff expressed
                                their concern that modernization of military equipment in South
                                Korea had not been authorized despite the fact that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_NNIT1">NNIT</gloss>s had been removed to the
                                demilitarized zone in June. The Joint Chiefs argued “that the need
                                for modernization of the United Nations Command’s matériel including
                                an atomic capability is sufficiently critical to justify positive
                                action without delay.” They added that, under a broad interpretation
                                of the Armistice Agreement, such action could be taken without
                                reporting the introduction of modern weapons to the Neutral Nations
                                Supervisory Commission. (Department of Defense Files)</note> on this
                            subject, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed
                            again to the statements we had already made within the Military
                            Armistice Commission and to the United Nations. How could we, in their
                            light, now say something entirely different only a month later?</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> again maintained
                            that he had not known of the State–Defense decision, was not familiar
                            with the Unified Command Report, and did not consider the position
                            referred to therein as satisfactory. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1"
                                >Gray</persName> interrupted stating that while Defense did clear
                            these papers it did not think the position taken would preclude the
                            introduction of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> asked whether Defense
                            assumed that [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] could be introduced and unreported without
                            becoming generally known. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> admitted that the Koreans would probably
                            announce such introductions.</p>
                        <p>In response to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s
                            question as to how the weapons we wished could be introduced under
                            paragraph 13(d), Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            said that they could not. In his view, paragraph 13(d) is very specific
                            and precludes the introduction of anything but equivalent matériel. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> interrupted to say
                            that previously State and Defense had agreed that a liberal
                            interpretation of paragraph 13(d) would be adequate.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said that reduced to the
                            simplest terms the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> felt that
                            “modernization” of forces in Korea required [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. <pb n="308"
                                xml:id="pg_308" facs="0336"/>The question was then whether this
                            could be done under any reasonable interpretation of paragraph 13(d). If
                            not, our previous policy must be reconsidered.</p>
                        <p>Referring to the question of interpretation, Mr.
                                <persName>Leigh</persName> brought up the fact that the actions of
                            the other side were relevant.</p>
                        <p>At this juncture, Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>
                            had to leave for the White House, but prior to his departure he
                            confirmed that Defense intended to introduce [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] weapons of atomic
                            capability into south Korea, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified.</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> said that with
                            reference to the United Nations problem, he hoped that if the decision
                            was made to introduce [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>] it could be shown not to violate the
                            Armistice and would not be undertaken until after the next General
                            Assembly.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> agreed with the suggestion
                            that State and Defense had never really discussed the types of weapons
                            to be included in a modernization program and that it was now time to
                            come to grips with this problem. In his opinion, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> said he felt the most troublesome
                            angle was that of reporting. This might be resolved through reporting in
                            very general rather than specific terms.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> again
                            reiterated his previous agreement with the philosophy of maintaining a
                            military balance in Korea, but said the suspension of paragraph 13(d)
                            and cessation of reporting after our previous commitments to the Sixteen
                            and to the United Nations, would antagonize our allies and play into the
                            hands of Communist propaganda which has all along been portraying the
                            U.S. as violators of the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_WFO1">Wilcox</persName> pointed out that while
                            from a legal point of view, abrogation of an agreement by one party does
                            entitle recourse to similar violations by the other party, it would
                            nevertheless be extremely difficult to justify, especially in Asia, our
                            introduction of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] based on Communist violations as we thus far knew
                            them.</p>
                        <p>After discussing various possible lines of action, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_GG1">Gray</persName> and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> agreed that the next step was to get State and
                            Defense lawyers together to decide what items could be introduced under
                            a liberal interpretation of paragraph 13(d) and in what manner we should
                            report such items.<note n="8" xml:id="d168fn8">Immediately after this
                                meeting, Monroe Leigh, Captain Robbins, and Captain Moote of Defense
                                met with Colonel Raymond of <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss> and
                                Charles Runyon of <gloss target="#t_L1">L</gloss>/UNA to formulate
                                the legal opinions required by <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"

                                September 11, the lawyers reached a tentative consensus that the
                                only items that would create problems under a liberal interpretation
                                of paragraph 13d of the Armistice Agreement were weapons with atomic
                                as well as conventional capability: the 280-mm. gun, the Honest

                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> said that he would omit the usual
                            summary of the Progress Report on our policy in Korea because the
                            members of the Council were doubtless familiar enough with it. He
                            pointed out that perhaps the essence of the problem with respect to this
                            country was the large size of the U.S. assistance programs. These
                            amounted to some 800 million dollars in Fiscal Year 1957. In closing he
                            reminded the National Security Council of its directive to the <gloss

                        <p>The President commented with a sigh that we were surely spending an awful
                            lot of money in Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> added that he had very much hoped to reverse the
                            direction of our spending in Korea downward instead of upward. Indeed he
                            had had the level down to 700 million in 1955 but the levels were now
                            pushing up again. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> reminded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> that the small <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310"
                                facs="0338"/>reduction in 1955 was accounted for by the fact that
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces were then living
                            off military matériel which we had given to them. We knew nevertheless
                            that when this materiel was gone, the levels of our expenditures in
                            Korea would again have to go up.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then alluded to
                            the success of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reserve program.
                            The success of this program, he thought, might enable us to cut back a
                            little on the size of the regular forces of the Republic of Korea and
                            thus ease the burden on the Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>Turning to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> the
                            President inquired whether he and his people in the Pentagon had taken a
                            look at the situation in Korea lately. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> replied that the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff had this situation constantly under review. In point of fact,
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> authorities did not wish to cut
                            back in any military area. They are even now complaining that they need
                            to modernize their air force, to acquire additional naval vessels and
                            even to modernize their army.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> then cited the
                            problem posed by Section 13–d of the armistice agreement in Korea. He
                            warned that in sending armaments to Korea we were stretching to the
                            absolute limit the definitions under Paragraph 13–d. Certainly we could
                            not augment the size of the South Korean armed forces or give these
                            forces entirely new weapons without a plain violation of Section 13–d.
                            Such a violation was bound to cause trouble with our allies and with the
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>. Accordingly, we should certainly
                            not try to follow such a course of action without a very careful look at
                            the consequences.</p>
                        <p>The President observed that it seemed to him that the poorer a country
                            was, the larger the army it seemed to want. It was high time to remember
                            the words of wisdom of people like Clausewitz. The strongest limits to
                            the desire of a man to go to war were set by the forces at his disposal.
                            We have really got to sit down and determine the likelihood of an armed
                            attack on South Korea. While it was obvious that the United States must
                            keep token forces in South Korea, the President believed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman Rhee</persName> was insisting on too large
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that
                            certainly if the South Koreans now set out to obtain a large air force,
                            it would really “bust them” financially. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> pointed out that the North
                            Korean air force was already very large and modern. The President said
                            of course someone else was providing the North Koreans with their air
                            force. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> went on
                            to say that the North Koreans were maintaining their pressure on the
                            Republic of Korea very successfully. There was indeed a great deal of
                            infiltration into South Korea. On the other side of the picture, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, the South
                            Koreans are not above working on the United States in every way to
                            induce us to shell out more money.</p>
                        <pb n="311" xml:id="pg_311" facs="0339"/>
                        <p>Governor Stassen reminded the Council that the power plants which had
                            been developing since the end of hostilities were now about ready to
                            function. This would mean a great boost to South Korean industry and
                            would enable industry to absorb the manpower of a number of South Korean
                            regular divisions. He therefore suggested that in the course of the next
                            year we should be able to cut down the size of the regular South Korean
                            army by some five divisions putting these divisions into reserve and
                            allowing the manpower to be diverted to industry.</p>
                        <p>The President said he thought Governor Stassen’s idea sounded very good.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> observed that at
                            any rate we must not allow the United States to get frozen in its
                            position with respect to Korea. He added that there was no real way to
                            cut U.S. expenses except by reducing the size of the armed forces of
                            South Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            also believed that we should try to get more of our own U.S. forces out
                            of Korea although we should probably have to leave one U.S. division
                            there.</p>
                        <p>The President then said to Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> that this was a problem for him and his people
                            to take a hand in and to look at in terms of what we could profitably
                            have there by way of force levels. Our views might have to be modified
                            later by what we could get the South Koreans to agree to but the first
                            step was to determine what we ourselves should do from the standpoint of
                            our own advantage. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> replied that of course one problem involved here
                            was keeping our control of the very large armed forces in South Korea.
                            There was now very little of a <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> flavor
                            to these forces. Recently the South Koreans had asked that a South
                            Korean be named as Deputy <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander.
                            This problem would of course be aggravated if we now reduced our own
                            U.S. contribution to the armies in South Korea. The President agreed
                            that this indeed was a problem. He pointed out that in addition to our
                            own troops we were also putting 800 million dollars into South Korea
                            each year. We could certainly expect that as a result the South Koreans
                            could go along with us in solving some of these problems.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> stated that there
                            was yet another piece to the overall problem. A recommendation had
                            recently been received from General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> to move the U.S. forces out of Korea and station
                            them in Japan. This recommendation had appealed neither to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> nor to Admiral
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>. In point of fact,
                            of course, the Japanese want us to remove our forces from Japan. At this
                            point the President once again re-emphasized his view on the unfortunate
                            repercussions which were bound to occur when we stationed our forces for
                            long periods in foreign countries. The result was only hatred. The
                            President added that he was more disposed to get our U.S. forces out of
                            Japan than out of Korea. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> pointed out that as of <pb n="312"
                                xml:id="pg_312" facs="0340"/>the present time, we have practically
                            nothing but service troops in Japan. The First Cavalry Division was so
                            split up that it could hardly be described as a fighting unit. To make
                            matters worse, said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1"
                                >Hoover</persName>, we are encountering a great difficulty
                            maintaining our position in Okinawa. The President said he too was very
                            much afraid that the Okinawa situation would soon rise up to smack us in
                            the face. He then repeated his desire for a report from the Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff recommending what we should do about Korea over the next two
                            years. This should set forth what we conceive to be the minimum forces
                            which our interests dictate we should keep in Korea even though we
                            should later on have to modify this figure. The President said he was
                            personally convinced that we did not need as many men as were now under
                            arms in South Korea. Our policy might well fall of its own weight if we
                            were obliged to put 800 million dollars each year into a single small
                            country like Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> repeated his view
                            that in the case of Korea the United States was backing a loser.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> informed the
                            Council that the State Department was presently considering the
                            possibility of converting some of the South Korean troops into work
                            battalions as an intermediate step. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> inquired what these battalions
                            would work at? Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName>
                            replied, on roads, hospitals, public works and the like. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> asked whether the
                            United States would be expected to put up the money for such
                            projects?</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen then introduced the problem of total overseas dollar
                            expenditures and the balance of payments situation which he said was
                            becoming very serious for the United States.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> warned that
                            when Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> and the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff took their look at the Korean situation, they
                            could not look at it in a vacuum. It was costing the United States a
                            billion dollars annually to support our forces overseas and we had got
                            to find some way to cut a billion dollars off of our overseas
                            expenditures very soon. It was this sum which was dragging us down.
                            Nevertheless, what we needed to do here with respect to Korea must also
                            be considered in the light of what we want to do in other parts of the
                            world. Certainly we were getting to the point where we have got to take
                            a look at where all this money was going. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> insisted that we could not
                            control domestic inflation simply by recourse to a tight money policy if
                            we continue to spend a billion dollars a year in support of our overseas
                            forces. We were actually going to be faced soon with serious inflation.
                            While the rest of the world was getting better with respect to its
                            financial situation, the United States was getting steadily worse. This
                            problem was extremely serious and it had been neglected by the
                            Administration.</p>
                        <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0341"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> insisted that not
                            all of this expenditure was to be laid at the door of the Defense
                            Department. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            agreed that not all of it but only about three-fourths of it was the
                            responsibility of Defense. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> replied that nevertheless this expenditure was
                            going to rise still higher if we did not change our policies with
                            respect to Korea and similar places. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> went on to insist that this
                            problem had a monetary aspect as well as a foreign policy aspect. The
                            United States must retain its economic strength at home if it ever
                            expected to keep its friends and allies abroad. These people stick only
                            with a winner. If we seem to be a loser, they will run away from us so
                            fast we won’t be able to see them. We are now living in a fool’s
                            paradise and have been doing so for the last six, eight or ten
                            months.</p>
                        <p>The President expressed the opinion that we were spending a lot more
                            money abroad two years ago than we are now spending. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> denied this and said there was
                            not much difference. The deficit had been pretty consistently a billion
                            dollars each year. Speaking not in terms of authorization but of actual
                            money “taken out of your pants” there wasn’t a difference of more than
                            perhaps a 100 million dollars a year between the Eisenhower
                            Administration and the last Truman year.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen expressed the opinion that both the President and the
                            Secretary of the Treasury were right in their contentions. The Free
                            World was greatly in need of some of our gold back in 1953. It was now,
                            however, getting too much of a claim on it and it was time to reverse
                            directions.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> assured Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> that the Council recognized
                            the problem which he had set forth but he said he wished to put a
                            question to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>.
                            How do we proceed to try to deal with the problem of our military and
                            economic assistance? Should we deal with it on a specific area basis or
                            do we try to deal with it first on a world-wide basis? Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that in his
                            opinion the way to proceed was to agree on the precise amount of money
                            that we can afford to spend overseas and then adjust individual area
                            programs in terms of this overall amount. Instead of this procedure,
                            what we are now doing is simply spending what we think it is nice and
                            useful to spend overseas. Mr. <persName>Jackson</persName> again pressed
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> for an opinion
                            as to the right governmental procedure with which we ought to tackle
                            this problem. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            repeated his opinion that we should start with what we think we can
                            afford and work backward from this point. This is the way you ran a
                            private business or a family financially.</p>
                        <p>The President pointed out to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> that of course if your very existence was at
                            stake, you would pay out a lot more money than you estimate you could
                            afford. This was true even in the <pb n="314" xml:id="pg_314"
                                facs="0342"/>case of a private family. The President went on to say
                            that Korea would provide a very good laboratory case to assist us in
                            determining what we should do about our expenditures on a world-wide
                            basis. In fact he felt that the specific area approach was about the
                            only effective way to try to solve the problem of our expenditures
                            overseas. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            commented that we had still got to balance what we did in Korea with
                            what we propose to do in Indo-China and other such places. The President
                            said that our target at any rate should be to try to reduce our overseas
                            expenditures by the sum of one billion dollars.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> then expressed
                            his willingness to take on the assignment that the President had
                            requested and said that he would kick up a good enough paper for the
                            Council to talk from.</p>
                        <p>Governor Stassen closed the discussion by stating his opinion that the
                            National Security Council should have before it a study of the balance
                            of payments problem. He pointed out that we had been giving a lot of
                            consideration recently to the problem of the Federal budget. We had not
                            given enough time and thought as to how we should handle the problem of
                            our world balance of payments.</p>

                        <p>According to the <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> report
                            the continued maintenance of 20 Korean infantry divisions, 10 reserve
                            divisions, 1 Marine division, and present Naval and Air Forces, a total
                            strength of 720,000 men or 3.2 percent of the population, will cost
                            approximately $500 million annually in military aid and direct forces
                            support. In addition, $150 million annually in local currency is
                            required, making the total cost of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> military establishment $650 million per annum. These
                            expenditures do not provide for any “modernization” so that a gradual
                            deterioration in combat effectiveness through obsolescence is to be
                            anticipated. The cost of maintaining two U.S. infantry divisions and
                            supporting units in Korea is likewise very great.</p>
                        <p>If we direct our attention to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces a number of interdependent factors bear directly upon a
                            determination of the level best designated to promote both short- and
                            long-term U.S. interests. In addition to obvious Korean defense
                            requirements, political and economic justifications have been used to
                            support the continued maintenance of such a sizeable Korean military
                            establishment at such tremendous cost both to the U.S. and to the Korean

                        <p><gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5514 states as a current U.S.
                            objective in Korea “to develop <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                            forces sufficient for internal security and capable of defending <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> territory short of attack by a major
                            power”. This has generally been interpreted as calling for adequate
                            defense against the renewal of aggression by north Korean forces alone,
                            but not against intervention by Chinese Communist and/or Soviet forces.

                            states that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army “is almost
                            twice the size of the north Korean Army” and “is superior to the north
                            Korean Army in heavy weapons and artillery”. It concludes that “despite
                            weakness in the air, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, given
                            adequate logistic support, could repel an aggression by north Korean
                            forces alone”. “However, against aggression by combined Communist and
                            north Korean forces the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would be
                            incapable of conducting a sustained defense without prompt military
                            assistance from the U.S.”</p>
                        <p>In brief, the U.S., at a cost of $500 million per annum is maintaining
                            south Korean armed forces adequate to repel aggression by north Korean
                            forces alone, i.e., a repetition of the 1950 invasion, but inadequate to
                            defend south Korea against Communist Chinese and/ or Soviet aggression.
                            Since the equipment and weapons of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces have been limited under the Armistice Agreement
                            to conventional types of 1950 vintage, any far reaching modernization of
                            the north Korean forces, signs of which are already reported, could
                            result in the inability of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army
                            to put up a successful defense even against those forces though inferior
                            in numbers and acting alone.</p>
                        <p>A deterrent to renewed Communist aggression, far more effective than any
                            military strength which is or could be maintained in south Korea,
                            exists, however, in the guarantees embodied in the Joint Policy
                            Declaration of July 27, 1953, and the U.S.-Korean Mutual Defense Treaty

                        <p>As a newly independent country, inexperienced in self-government,
                            thwarted in its desire for unification, recently torn by invasion,
                            occupation, and war, Korea is faced with the ever present threat of
                            political instability and Communist subversion. Both have thus far been
                            held successfully at bay by an authoritarian, semi-“police state” regime
                            dominated by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Syngman

                                facs="0346"/>Korean people to remain non-Communist and independent
                            is the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army. As a visible and
                            concrete force ready at battle stations to repel renewed aggression, it
                            provides the Korean people with a tangible guarantee of continued free
                            and independent existence enabling them to concentrate on the
                            reconstruction of their country and the development of some sort of
                            democratic political framework. Were the armed forces to be cut
                            drastically one immediate effect would probably be a loss of confidence
                            in the future on the part of the Korean people and a break in their will
                            to resist Communist subversion from within and Communist blandishments
                            on the unification issue from without. Such adverse repercussions might
                            largely be avoided, however, were a reduction in forces accompanied by
                            the arrival of “new” weapons thus sustaining or augmenting their present
                            defensive capabilities.</p>
                        <p>Apart from the internal political importance of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army, its existence through U.S.
                            support as the largest, best-trained, and equipped, and battle-tested
                            non-Communist force in the Far East may have considerable symbolic
                            significance throughout the area. Its reduction in strength might in the
                            eyes of many be interpreted as a reflection of Western and particularly
                            U.S. disinterest in maintaining Korea as a non-Communist enclave on the
                            Asiatic mainland and as an anchor in the defense line running through
                            Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Again were “new” weapons to be
                            provided to counterbalance force reductions these adverse psychological
                            repercussions would undoubtedly be largely avoided.</p>
                        <p>In summary, any drastic cut in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Army without the parallel introduction of modern weapons might not only
                            endanger Korea’s internal political stability and weaken the morale and
                            anti-Communist convictions of her people but could undermine the will to
                            resist Communism elsewhere in the Far East.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">3. Economic Justification</hi></p>
                        <p>The armed forces numbering 720,000 men are perhaps the greatest single
                            factor in the Korean economy. A military establishment of this size not
                            only provides direct sustenance and technical training to a large
                            segment of the population, but indirectly furnishes a stimulus to many
                            economic activities. Any sizeable cut back would undoubtedly result in
                            intensifying the present unemployment problem. In addition, the fact
                            that the Korean troops now enjoy a standard of living considerably above
                            the general civilian population and have become accustomed to a more
                            “modern” and more “Western” way of life adds to the difficulty of
                            assimilating those who are released. Complications are already being
                            experienced with officers and men demobilized in accord with normal
                            rotational procedures. In many cases, these men having achieved certain
                            skills and having become accustomed <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319"
                                facs="0347"/>to the standards established by American training,
                            equipment, and supply return to their villages and farms, find a
                            resumption of their former way of life unattractive and thence
                            congregate unemployed and discontented in the towns and cities.</p>
                        <p>Should the military establishment be drastically cut over a short period
                            of time, the problem of assimilating hundreds of thousands of
                            ex-soldiers could only be met by a vast public works program, perhaps
                            far more costly to establish and maintain than military units of
                            comparable size. In brief, reducing the Korean Armed Forces to any great
                            extent would not necessarily reduce internal governmental costs or total
                            U.S. contributions and might be expected to create serious social and
                            economic problems.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of a reduction of forces involves senior officers. At the
                            present time, neither private business and industry nor the national and
                            local governments could absorb a large number of young, intelligent,
                            vigorous, highly educated, rank conscious general officers. These
                            officers suddenly retired or released would in fact have no place to go
                            outside of politics and through force of circumstances would undoubtedly
                            be swept up in political maneuvers perhaps of a revolutionary
                            nature.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Conclusions</hi></p>
                        <p>The maintenance of a military establishment in Korea consisting primarily
                            of large ground forces organized and equipped along World War II lines
                            and costing the U.S. $500 million annually cannot be justified on purely
                            military grounds. Certain political and economic factors do tend to
                            support their continuation, however.</p>
                        <p>Were these forces gradually reduced with parallel “modernization” both in
                            organization and equipment their military utility would not only be
                            vastly increased, but the adverse political repercussions of such a
                            reduction would be minimal. The economic difficulties of a reduction
                            could probably be overcome by a large public works type program.</p>
                        <p>The cost of “modernization” and of such public works programs would in
                            the short run exceed that of maintaining the armed forces at their
                            present levels. In the long run, however, the overall cost of the Korean
                            military establishment should be materially less, the Korean economy
                            would benefit by the additional skilled and semiskilled labor released
                            from the armed forces, and our military posture in south Korea would be
                            such as to offer reasonable opportunities for defense against a
                            Communist attack even though spearheaded by Manchurian based air power
                            and nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>With respect to U.S. forces suffice it to say that their presence at
                            current strength in Korea serves as a deterrent to renewed aggression
                            and contributes greatly to the defensive capabilities of the <gloss

                                facs="0348"/>Likewise they support materially in troop expenditures,
                            local purchases, and employment of local labor, the Korean economy. As a
                            symbol of U.S. determination to preserve Korean independence they foster
                            the will to resist Communism not only in Korea but elsewhere in the Far
                            East. As in the case with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army,
                            however, U.S. ground forces in Korea could undoubtedly be reduced
                            without endangering their several roles were they at the same time to be
                            modernized and provided with weapons of nuclear capability.</p>
                        <p>The level of both U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces is,
                            therefore, inseparable from the question of “modernization”. Unless and

                        <p>If program outlined above adhered to, funds as set forth essential.
                            Otherwise, we may end up with large but ineffective force. Factors
                            inherent in military establishment which may lead to serious detriment
                            if not corrected are reduced training, equipment obsolescence, low pay,
                            and long service.</p>
                        <p>In this situation, I believe best course is return to general intent
                            Agreed Minute. Any reduction in present Army forces must for
                            political-psychological reasons be accompanied by measures which clearly
                            demonstrate increased striking power of reduced forces. To accomplish
                            this, I propose reduction Army forces to ten active plus ten reserve
                            divisions by end <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 59. This reduction to
                            be accompanied by replacement worn-out transport and communications
                            equipment, introduction weapons of atomic capability (i.e., Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and Nike); addition one jet fighter-bomber
                            wing plus one tactical control squadron and one tactical reconnaissance
                            squadron; maintainance Navy and Marine Corps at present effective
                            strength.</p>
                        <p>Reduction in active divisions should be phased over three-year period
                            beginning <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 57 in step with measures to
                            enhance military effectiveness of smaller force. Ground must be prepared
                            by negotiations to obtain consent <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            Government and careful attention paid to impact public disclosure of new
                            measures.</p>

                            effected by reduction in active divisions over three-year period will be
                            absorbed by expenditures for new military equipment and increased
                            economic expenditures, i.e., labor intensive projects to provide
                            employment discharged soldiers. These latter projects would of course
                            accelerate economic development. By <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss>
                            60, reduction present levels both <gloss target="#t_MDAP1">MDAP</gloss>
                            and economic aid should be possible. In any event, it is imperative to
                            avoid realignment of present programs on crash basis if we are not to
                            endanger achievement United States objectives in Korea and indeed

                                        This estimate based on 35–40 percent saving pay and

                            to be considered. Introduction of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of

                            other things, upon its effect on U.S. world-wide policies, objectives,
                            and position. In my opinion, the introduction of such weapons could be
                            justified only were we to possess incontrovertible evidence of a similar
                            violation on the part of the Communists. To my knowledge, such evidence
                            is not at hand. The Department has already in principle concurred in
                            “modernization” of forces in Korea, short of atomic weapons, under a
                            liberal interpretation of Article 13(d).</p>

                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> inquired as to
                            whether there are any new developments with respect to Clause 13(d) of
                            the Armistice Agreement in Korea and mentioned his understanding that
                            the question had been turned over to the lawyers for interpretation. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that the
                            lawyers have now given their opinion that the U.N. forces can move in
                            anything they want to with the exception of two categories ([<hi

                            and jet aircraft). Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> commented this was not good enough from the
                            military point of view and remarked humorously that he had expected this
                            opinion, and that is why he had not wanted in the first place to have
                            the issue referred to the lawyers.</p>

                        <p>General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> spoke on this item
                            on which discussion had been requested by the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss>. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            spoke of recent correspondence received from General <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> regarding the internal
                            political situation in Korea. He said unfortunately General Yee,<note

                            living up to the poor expectations we had had of him. He said that there
                            was a close alliance between General Yee and the new Minister of
                            Defense, <persName corresp="#p_KY1">Kim</persName><note n="3"

                            Chairman of the Korean <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>, out of the
                            country as the Korean representative on the United Nations Military
                            Committee until finally Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> had to intervene with President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to keep Chong there. General Yee
                            had made a demagogic public speech on October 1 calling for the
                            unification of Korea by force, and he has also been reported as saying
                            that he was sick and tired of General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName>’s opposition to his political views. Many
                            changes are being made down the line to put pro-Yee men into positions
                            of influence. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName>
                            remarked that it is a very sobering thing to have a man of General Yee’s
                            views in charge of the ground troops in an area of such importance to
                            us. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> commented
                            that General Yee is the most dangerous man in the Korean picture today,
                            and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed with
                            this view. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> asked
                            whether it would not be possible for Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> to have a frank talk with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and <pb n="332"
                                xml:id="pg_332" facs="0360"/>point out frankly that the retention of
                            General Yee in a position of such importance will inevitably affect
                            US-Korean relations and the extent that the US is able to cooperate with
                            the Korean armed forces. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> agreed that this step should be taken,
                            although he pointed out that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> is a very old man and in many ways is a virtual
                            prisoner of the forces around him. He said that he did not know how such
                            a conversation would turn out. He agreed that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> should talk to the President
                            but stressed that it was a delicate and difficult situation. General
                                <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> suggested that the
                            excesses of General Yee’s October 1st speech might be used as a basis
                            for approaching the President. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                                >Burke</persName> referred to the position of Admiral Sohn.<note
                                n="5" xml:id="d175fn5">Admiral Sohn Won-il, former Minister of
                                National Defense.</note> They recognized that he had lost out for
                            the present in a test of strength with Yee but thought there was a
                            possibility that he would come back from his round-the-world tour with
                            the full confidence of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> and this might lead to his moving back into the
                            center of the picture. All agreed that enhancement of Sohn’s influence
                            would be in US interests, but Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> was less optimistic than Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> over the possibility of Sohn’s
                            return to a position of preeminence. In that connection, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> spoke of his satisfaction
                            over the fact that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            has great confidence in both Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> and General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName>. He expressed the view that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> has perhaps more trust
                            and confidence in <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> than in
                            any American representative during his (<persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s) tenure as Assistant Secretary. He
                            emphasized that <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> make an
                            extraordinarily fine team to represent US interests in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> said that the
                            deteriorating internal situation in Korea, together with our
                            frustrations over Section 13(d) of the Armistice, left him with two
                            major preoccupations: (1) the status and safety of our forces in Korea
                            and (2) the position of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> and how far we can go with him. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> said that we could not overlook
                            the fact that, as things are going in Korea now, we might one of these
                            days be faced with an outbreak of civil war in the South; he raised the
                            question whether we want to be there with our forces if that should
                            happen. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> interposed to
                            remark that, if large scale trouble should break out in Korea, we would
                            be better off to have forces there than to have removed them. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asserted that the
                            presence of our forces in Korea is a major factor in ensuring that there
                            will not be a civil war. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> agreed with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>, and Admiral <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                                >Burke</persName> foresaw that, if there should be civil war or
                            chaotic political conditions in the Republic of Korea, the communists
                            would inevitably increase their influence and would almost surely take
                            over as an aftermath of the situation. General <pb n="333"
                                xml:id="pg_333" facs="0361"/><persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> pointed out that at one time we were so organized
                            in Korea as to enable us to exercise tight control over Korean gas and
                            oil stocks; now we do not have that control. Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> called attention to the fact
                            that we would not have any control at all if we should move out of Korea
                            but went on to declare that the problem raised by General <persName
                                corresp="#p_TGMD1">Taylor</persName> offers another strong reason
                            for getting rid of General Yee. General <persName corresp="#p_TGMD1"
                                >Taylor</persName> referred to the proposal to invite Defense
                            Minister <persName corresp="#p_KY1">Kim</persName> to the US for a
                            visit. He said that he was opposed to inviting <persName>Kim</persName>
                            here as long as he was not a proved friend on our side. [Here follows

                            Board consideration of the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> report by
                            pointing out that no estimate had been included of the force reductions,

                            to paragraph 1 of the report and said force levels could not be
                            determined until a decision on introducing [<hi rend="italic">less than

                        <p rend="center">“Conclusions</p>
                        <p>“1. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> continues to be
                            dominant in South Korea. Despite widespread popular dissatisfaction with
                            his regime, his position will probably not be seriously challenged at
                            least during the next year.</p>
                        <p>“2. The recent election as Vice President of <persName
                                corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName> from the opposition
                            Democratic Party has been followed by considerable reshuffling in the
                            cabinet and in the military leadership and by unrest in the Liberal
                            Party. These developments make the presidential succession somewhat
                            uncertain. However, we believe that on <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s death the constitutionally designated successor
                            will take office, even if, as is possible, the constitution is amended
                            to bar <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName>. Even an orderly
                            succession would almost certainly be followed by a period of political
                            instability, and the possibility of violent disorders cannot be
                            excluded. Any successor is likely to be less intransigent than <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> both on domestic and foreign
                            issues.</p>
                        <pb n="335" xml:id="pg_335" facs="0363"/>
                        <p>“3. If US military or economic assistance were substantially reduced, or
                            if the US made a major reduction in its forces in Korea, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would be vehement in his
                            objections and would seek by threats, pressures, or possibly the
                            creation of incidents to raise US fears of renewed hostilities in Korea.
                            However, we believe it unlikely that <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> would in fact launch a unilateral attack north.</p>
                        <p rend="center">“Discussion</p>
                        <p>“4. The presidential election in South Korea in May 1956 revealed
                            stronger popular opposition to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> and the Liberal Party than had been evident up to
                            that time. Even though the major opposition candidate died before
                            election day, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, who
                            had received 74.6 percent of the total vote in 1952, polled only 55.6
                            percent. Moreover, Yi Ki-pung, the Liberal Party vice presidential
                            candidate, was defeated by <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang
                                Myon</persName>, the nominee of the opposition Democratic Party.
                            Although the election has apparently not fundamentally shaken <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s domination of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> government, it has revealed
                            deficiencies in the apparatus of his control, and has been followed by a
                            number of changes. As a result the political situation in South Korea
                            has become considerably more obscure.</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">“Postelection Political
                                Developments</hi></p>
                        <p>“5. The President has shifted Chong Il-kwon, former army chief of staff,
                            to the chairmanship of the joint chiefs of staff, a position of less
                            military influence, and replaced Admiral Son Won-il as Minister of
                            National Defense. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            probably took these actions partly because of concern over the failure
                            of certain elements of the army to give its full support to him and the
                            Liberal Party in the May elections, and because of the potential
                            challenge to his position inherent in the close relationship between
                            General Chong, Admiral Son, and Yi Ki-pung. Another action tending to
                            reduce the influence of General Chong was a major reshuffle of army
                            general officers initiated by the new army chief of staff, General
                                <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yi Hyong-kun</persName>, and approved by
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. This resulted in
                            the transfer of many of Chong’s supporters from key posts.</p>
                        <p>“6. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s selection of
                            General <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yi Hyong-kun</persName> as the new
                            army chief of staff probably enhanced <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s control of the army. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yi</persName> has shown himself less amenable to US
                            guidance than was his predecessor, and is probably more responsible to
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s wishes. Although
                            General <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yi</persName> is known to have had
                            friendly relations with <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang
                                Myon</persName> and Lee Bum Suk, he is not known to have developed
                            an association with any political party. General <persName
                                corresp="#p_YH1">Yi</persName>’s future political leanings are
                            uncertain but he will probably remain loyal to <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> during the latter’s lifetime.</p>
                        <pb n="336" xml:id="pg_336" facs="0364"/>
                        <p>“7. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> has probably increased the
                            responsiveness of the National Police Force to his orders by appointing
                            as its new chief ’tiger’ <persName>Kim</persName>, who is noted for his
                            brutal application of force when so ordered. The army’s <gloss
                                target="#t_CIC1">CIC</gloss>, the other major internal security
                            force, remains under <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s direct
                            control as do the Provost Marshal General Command and some small
                            semi-official strong-arm groups.</p>
                        <p>“8. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> has made little
                            progress in strengthening the Liberal Party. He has forced the party to
                            accept Yi Ki-pung’s continued nominal leadership despite the latter’s
                            defeat in the elections. He probably continues to favor
                                <persName>Yi</persName>—an ineffective political leader—because he
                            represents no real challenge to <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s power. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            has continued to resist party participation in the determination of
                            government policy. Moreover, he has done little to improve the position
                            of the Liberal Party in the face of the possibility that a member of the
                            Democratic Party will succeed to the presidency. This is a matter of
                            concern to many party members and some are probably considering a switch
                            in their political affiliation. As a result, <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> is under increased pressure to modify his dominant
                            position in the government and in the party. However, though he may make
                            concessions on particular issues, he will probably not accept any
                            significant modification of his personal control of the government.
                            Futhermore, unless <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is
                            physically incapacitated, the majority of the Liberal Party will
                            probably not seriously challenge his control, at least during the next
                            year.</p>

                            its unexpected success. The party has in the past suffered from
                            factionalism, and the sudden death of <persName corresp="#p_SI1">Sin

                            seemed to open the door to greater disunity. However, since the election
                            factional leaders have shown a willingness to maintain basic party unity
                            and <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName>’s position within the
                            party has been strengthened. Both of these trends were probably further
                            enhanced by the recent unsuccessful attempt to assassinate <persName

                            in accordance with constitutional provisions. Another possibility is the

                        <p>“14. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and some
                            military leaders (including General <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yi
                                Hyong-kun</persName>) have considered the problem of modernizing the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces. They apparently
                            have been thinking in terms of an over-all force reduction, compensated
                            for by the introduction of modern weapons. In this connection they
                            probably assume a continuation of US assistance, at least at the present
                            level, to take care of the increased cost of modern arms, particularly
                            jet aircraft.</p>
                        <p>“15. Should the US propose a substantial cut in military aid, President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would oppose it with
                            vehemence and would seek to raise US fears of a renewal of hostilities
                            in Korea. This he might do by generating border incidents designed to
                            give the impression of hostile Communist intent, and by threatening to
                            withdraw his forces from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command
                            or to march north on his own. He would probably also threaten to seek a
                            rapprochement with the North Korean Communist regime. Concurrently he
                            would probably attempt to bring indirect pressure on the US government
                            by taking action prejudicial to the interests of the US business
                            community in Korea and by increasing the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> anti-Japanese campaign. He would probably also become
                            increasingly uncooperative in the implementation of the US aid
                            programs.</p>
                        <p>“16. If US military aid were reduced substantially despite <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> protestation, <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> might attempt to maintain his
                            forces at existing levels by deficit financing and, perhaps, by
                            diverting some <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> funds from other
                            uses. Although he would know that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> would not have sufficient foreign exchange to purchase
                            equipment and supplies and that therefore <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> military capabilities would decline, nevertheless he
                            might take this action hoping to force the US to reconsider the cut in
                            military aid rather than accept the possibility of an economic collapse
                            in South Korea. He might also withdraw his forces from the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command. It is not likely, however, that
                            he would seek a rapprochement with the North Korean Communist
                            regime.</p>
                        <p>“17. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> probably would consider a
                            major reduction of US forces in Korea a more serious indication of an
                            adverse trend in US policy toward Korea then a reduction in military
                            assistance to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, and hence
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would be more likely to
                            withdraw his forces from the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> command
                            than in the circumstance discussed in paragraph 16 above. From the
                            Korean point of view the presence of a substantial force of US troops in
                            Korea is a visible and more dependable guarantee of continuing US
                            interest in Korea than the existence of a security treaty.</p>
                        <p>“18. However, in either case we believe that <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> is unlikely to launch a unilateral attack on North
                            Korea. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and <gloss

                                facs="0367"/>leaders generally recognize that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> alone cannot achieve unification
                            through military action. They also probably believe that under present
                            world circumstances the chances of embroiling the US in renewed
                            hostilities would be slight. However, the possibility of a unilateral
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> attack or of generated incidents
                            which might precipitate fighting will remain, at least as long as
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> retains power. The danger
                            of a <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> attack would be most critical
                            during the period immediately following a US decision to reduce
                            assistance or to reduce its own forces. Even some of the military
                            leaders who have in the past been a restraining influence would be
                            persuaded that military action was necessary before the military
                            situation in South Korea had deteriorated.</p>
                        <p>“19. The large scale US economic aid since mid-1953 has been essential to
                            South Korea’s survival and rehabilitation. A substantial reduction in US
                            economic assistance would not only reduce the availability of
                            counterpart funds for support of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            military budget, but would also almost certainly reduce the already low
                            living standards and increase opposition to President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and his administration. Popular
                            unrest might develop into civil disorder which would probably have an
                            anti-American complexion. The North Korean and other Communists would
                            also seek to exploit this situation. Accordingly, President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would react almost as vigorously to
                            a US proposal for a substantial reduction in economic assistance as to a
                            proposal to reduce military assistance.</p>
                        <p>“20. It is likely that any successor to <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> will be less fully in control of the Korean
                            political situation and less intransigent. Accordingly, his successor
                            would probably be more amenable to a reduction in US military
                            assistance, particularly if the US continued to furnish a high level of
                            economic assistance.” ([<hi rend="italic">Document title, number, and

                            likewise omitted.</p>
                        <p>When the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> Planning Board met on
                            October 22 to consider the Joint Chiefs of Staff report, the
                            Department’s representative asked the <gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                >JCS</gloss> representative whether from a purely military point of
                            view any reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces was
                            possible in the event [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

                            answer was a flat “no” at which point <persName corresp="#p_GG1">Gordon
                                Gray</persName> said that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"

                                >NSC</gloss> and would give as his opinion that a mere transfer of
                                <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0371"/>four divisions to reserve
                            status was not worth all the difficulties inherent in the introduction
                            of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. Furthermore, Defense was not prepared to agree
                            to any decision on level of forces in Korea, either U.S. or <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, until a world-wide survey was
                            completed about mid-December.</p>
                        <p>As you know, it has consistently been L’s opinion that the introduction
                            of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] into south Korea would be a clear violation of
                            Article 13(d) of the Armistice. <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>
                            believes that reaction throughout the world and in the <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> is a highly important factor to be
                            considered. Introduction of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] must in the end depend, among
                            other things, upon its effect on U.S. world-wide policies, objectives,
                            and position. It is <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>’s opinion that the
                            introduction of such weapons could be justified only were we to possess
                            incontrovertible evidence of a similar violation on the part of the
                            Communists. As far as we know here, such evidence is not at hand.</p>
                        <p>Where all this leaves us I don’t exactly know at this point except that
                            the Planning Board still desires a new policy paper on Korea which is
                            certainly difficult to prepare until a decision is made on this
                            important policy question. At the same time, <gloss target="#t_DRF1"
                                >DRF</gloss> is preparing estimates on the economic implications
                            within the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of force reductions and
                            on world-wide reaction to the introduction of [<hi rend="italic">less
                                than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>], [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            Out of this “new look” at Korea may come a revised <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> paper, revised, that is, in format and
                            perhaps courses of action but with the same long and short-term
                            objectives.</p>
                        <p>This whole exercise has, of course, been inspired by a growing concern
                            that the Congress can at some future date reduce our various foreign
                            commitments in the interest of the domestic Defense budget which
                            apparently is steadily growing as a result of new weapon developments.
                            Korea, involving the largest sums of money, is the first on the list for
                            review at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> level and will be
                            followed by Formosa, Viet-Nam, Pakistan, and Turkey.</p>
                        <p>In connection with the force level problem, you will be interested in

                        <p>On the succession question, we have recently received a number of [<hi

                            reports which we found <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0372"
                            />particularly interesting, and apparently reliable. We summarized two
                            to them in a memorandum to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName><note n="5" xml:id="d180fn5">Not found in
                                Department of State files.</note> These two reports ran as follows:
                            The first, dated early October [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] reported that [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] in the event
                            of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s death,
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName> and the Democratic
                            Party would receive the support of the police, students, and general
                            populace. The Liberal Party would disintegrate, and the Army under its
                            present leader would support <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1"
                                >Chang</persName> but would try to control him. The second report,
                            also dated early October, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source
                                text not declassified</hi>] says that the Liberals could not oppose
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang</persName>’s succession because
                            they had favored the constitutional amendment in 1954. His succession,
                            however, would mean their end, unless they staged a coup d’état, which
                            would be highly uncertain of success.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">4-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            AFFE/8 Army also reported on the effects of the assignments. From a
                            careful reading of the data and analysis in these reports, we can secure
                            no clear-cut picture of a new line-up within the Army.</p>
                        <p>We have been inclined to read these various reports as indicating an
                            increasing probability that the succession will be more or less
                            uneventful. Thus, in the short run things look better. However, the
                            frequent references to the possible disintegration of the Liberal Party
                            tend to give pause. It is possible that in a relatively short time a
                            one-party system, under <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang
                                Myon</persName>, would lead to difficulties in U.S.-<gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> relations of a character similar to
                            those we have experienced with President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>. At the same time, we can share some of the
                            military concern over <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yi
                            Hyong-kun</persName>. Certainly in their view a smooth working
                            relationship between the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                            and <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> forces (including U.S.) is
                            essential for maintaining a unified <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command. Such a relationship, no doubt, tends to decrease the
                            probability of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces being used for
                            internal conflicts. There can be no doubt that such a relationship makes
                            it more difficult for President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> to use force for purposes that could lead to
                            excessive embarrassment of the U.S.</p>
                        <p>The thoughts of the Embassy on these questions: “if succession, then
                            what?”, “how about <persName corresp="#p_YH1">Yi Hyong-kun</persName>?”,
                            “what’s happening to the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Command
                            relationship with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> command?”, and
                            the many related questions would be more than welcome.</p>

                            I also referred to responsibilities faced by <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss>, and our hopes for further progress there in
                            settlement current problems, and expressed hope he would do what he
                            could to maintain calm atmosphere here.</p>
                        <p>In reply, President said he was disappointed, since “US appeared to be
                            continuing policy of peace at any price,” whereas he had hoped we would
                            take advantage of present opportunity, evidenced primarily by Hungarian
                            revolt and restiveness other satellites, to re-assert our support
                            captive peoples, force Soviets to back down, and thereby regain world
                            leadership. He went on to set out, in vague terms what he thought should
                            be done at this juncture. Basing his position on premise that <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> must help Hungary, he said if US would
                            only speak out other nations would follow lead and <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> would become such moral force that <gloss
                                target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> would be constrained follow its
                            decisions rather than face dishonor of being expelled, always provided
                                <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> made it plain there was no other
                            alternative. He argued that free world was entirely too fearful of
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>, and that this fear was
                            inhibiting adoption of firm attitude which was essential if Communist
                            threat is ever to be eliminated. He seemed to feel, in other words, that
                            threat of force would be sufficient to cause Soviet withdrawals
                            everywhere, and that they could be kept in line thereafter by code of
                            sanctions if free nations were prepared to apply them against
                            transgressions.</p>
                        <pb n="347" xml:id="pg_347" facs="0375"/>
                        <p>I naturally endeavored to point out certain fallacies in his arguments,
                            pointing out that in my view US was exercising leadership, that actions
                            by other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> members in response that
                            leadership in recent weeks was most encouraging, and that there was
                            great hope US policies would continue to meet with growing success. I
                            added that it seemed to me we were on way to accomplishing basic
                            objectives he had in mind, i.e., eventual elimination of Communist
                            threat and enduring peace. I fear, however, that I made little
                            impression on him, although I have found in past that he has sometimes
                            gradually come to an acceptance of our views.</p>
                        <p>When conversation turned from international plane to Korea, President
                            said in response my query that he had given much thought to earlier
                            proposal by some members of govt that North Korean revolt be encouraged
                            by covert distribution of leaflets and by other means such as radio
                            broadcasts, and had finally decided against it. He could not, he said,
                            encourage North Koreans to risk their lives unless South Koreans were
                            able to come to their aid, and this, he added, could not be done without
                            US support. He made this latter statement factually, and without
                            apparent emotion or rancour. I then asked if he had any ideas as to
                            discussion of Korean unification in <gloss target="#t_UNGA1"
                                >UNGA</gloss>, saying I assumed we must above all insist on
                            withdrawal of Chinese forces in North Korea and holding of free
                            elections. He agreed, adding that essential point was withdrawal of
                            Chinese; hard core of Korean Communists would withdraw too, as they knew
                            true temper of North Korean people, including Army, and unification
                            would then come about almost spontaneously.</p>
                        <p>In connection Chinese forces North Korea, he said he had high hopes that
                            discontent was rising in Red China, and confided that Chinese
                            Nationalists had told him they would invade mainland next year. He went
                            on to say that he had reached agreement with Generalissimo three years
                            ago that if one moved other would do likewise, but avoided saying he
                            would join Chinese next year.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, he said he had thought of writing President Eisenhower his
                            ideas re international situation, but hesitated to bother him.</p>
                        <p>I replied that I knew President would be glad to have his views and any
                            constructive suggestions, as frank discussions between allies could only
                            be helpful.</p>
                        <p>In sum, my impression remains that President, as reported my 440 Nov

                        <p>The Swiss and Swedish members of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> on November 16, subsequent to this telegram, rejected
                            the <gloss target="#t_KPACPV1">KPA/CPV</gloss> request that a Neutral
                            Nations Inspection Team inspect the wreckage of the <gloss

                            Demilitarized Zone. We do not believe the <gloss target="#t_KPACPV1"
                                >KPA/CPV</gloss> will press the issue further, lest they encourage
                            the Swiss and Swedes to withdraw, which would in effect dissolve the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>The reminder by <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> of past
                            recommendations to dissolve the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> is
                            surprising. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has not pressed us
                            further since our action of May 31, 1956, suspending our performance of
                            those provisions of the Armistice Agreement governing the operations of
                            the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in our area. We see no real
                            basis for concern about the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> in the
                            future. The Swiss and Swedes may ultimately withdraw. Meanwhile, its
                            continued existence seems to be doing no harm to us. Our Allies would
                            surely see no justification for further action on our part. Moreover,
                            for procedural reasons, it is difficult to understand what <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>’s recommendation amounts to.
                            Formal dissolution of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> would
                            require agreement of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> members,
                            including Poland and Czechoslovakia, and the agreement of the <gloss
                                target="#t_KPACPV1">KPA/CPV</gloss>. Our only real power to act
                            unilaterally in the situation would be through such indirect and
                            questionable tactics as ending transportation and logistic support of
                            the Swiss and Swedes.</p>

                        <p>On the 13(d) problem, our recent correspondence with Defense has effected
                            a tentative agreement that the problem of obsolescence of equipment
                            would be solved through a liberal interpretation of paragraph 13(d), and
                            an authorizing telegram to <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>
                            to introduce new equipment awaits the approval of Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>. We do not understand <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>’s continued insistence on
                            suspension of the paragraph. Early in 1956, <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1"
                                >CINCUNC</gloss> did indicate his opposition to reporting the new
                            types of equipment we planned to bring in and indicated also that, due
                            to inaccuracies shortly after the Armistice, we have not maintained our
                            credits on destroyed and worn-out equipment as we should have. From our
                            point of view, however, paragraph 13(d), which governs introductions of
                            combat equipment and prohibits reinforcement, is except for the
                            cease-fire provisions the most important part of the Armistice
                            Agreement. Its suspension would permit the Communist side legally to
                            introduce without reporting any amounts and types of combat equipment
                            they wish. Suspension of the paragraph would seem required only if the
                            Communists were staging a sharp build-up in Korea and we needed to
                            augment greatly our own combat equipment, which is not now the case. The
                            stated requirements of Defense can be satisfied by interpretation of
                            paragraph 13(d), and there seems to be no justification for suspension
                            of the paragraph at this time.</p>
                        <p>Our action on the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> problem in May
                            and consideration of action on the 13(d) problem seem to have encouraged
                            Defense and <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> to seek further
                            modification of the Armistice Agreement. In taking the <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> action, however, we stated that “the
                                <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> continues to regard the
                            Armistice Agreement as in force and limits its action to the particular
                            suspensions described …”<note n="3" xml:id="d184fn3">Ellipsis in the

                            and world opinion would almost surely consider that our action of May,
                            1956, and our general posture toward the Armistice Agreement show bad
                            faith.</p>

                        <p>Since the Cairo Declaration,<note n="4" xml:id="d185fn4">The Cairo
                                Declaration was the joint communiqué issued on December 1, 1943, at
                                the conclusion of the conference in Cairo of President Roosevelt,
                                Prime Minister Churchill, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The
                                communiqué pledged joint military operations against Japan and
                                liberation of all territories conquered by Japan. The statement
                                focused on China, but also noted that the leaders were “mindful of
                                the enslavement of the people of Korea,” and “determined that in due
                                course Korea shall become free and independent.” For text, see

                            the establishment and maintenance of a free, independent <pb n="352"
                                xml:id="pg_352" facs="0380"/>and unified Korea. We fought a major
                            war to prevent Communist compromise of this objective by military
                            aggression and in the fighting suffered thousands of casualties.
                            Although a cease-fire was effected in 1953, the armies remain deployed
                            in the field under an armistice and the threat of renewed aggression is
                            a very real one. The American public and the Congress, in my opinion,
                            fully appreciate this special situation and as a consequence, little
                            difficulty has been experienced when requests are made for aid to Korea.
                            It is widely appreciated that the United States was at fault prior to
                            the opening of the Korean hostilities in having withdrawn its tactical
                            forces, in having failed to create adequately trained and equipped
                            forces in south Korea, and in having failed to make clear that it would
                            not countenance Communist aggression. Since the signing of the
                            Armistice, we have entered into a Mutual Defense Treaty with Korea,
                            supplementing the Joint Policy Declaration of the Sixteen, and we have
                            assisted in the development of a larger and more effective Korean
                            military establishment. Nonetheless, our position is not altogether
                            secure; the most recent North Korean [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line

                            Koreans a marked superiority in the air and a capability of launching a
                            limited attack without warning. It also points out that Communist forces
                            in Korea could be reinforced from Manchuria within eight days by at
                            least six Chinese Communist armies.</p>
                        <p>I believe our military objectives in Korea are well stated in paragraph 2
                            of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5514: to create Republic of Korea
                                (<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>) armed forces capable of
                            maintaining internal security and of defending <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> territory short of attack by a major power. On the
                            basis of our experiences in 1950-1953, and subsequent analysis of
                            world-wide Communist bloc policy, we know that it is unlikely that north
                            Korea alone will attack the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> provided
                            appreciable military preparedness is maintained. An attack from north
                            Korea, if it came, would be backed by Communist China and possibly the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss>. We know from experience that
                            we could not rely on any forewarning of the reinforcement of the north
                            Korean forces by Chinese Communist forces. Although we cannot create
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces capable of a
                            sustained defense against Communist China and the <gloss

                        <p>The force levels of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces
                            also have an important bearing on United States military and political
                            posture in Korea and in the Far East. There is every reason to believe
                            that any reductions would have widespread and adverse repercussions in
                            Korea and throughout the non-Communist world. A report prepared by the R
                            area of the Department (IR-7367, November 1, 1956)<note n="6"

                            strength reduced. It has been fortunate for us that the south Koreans
                            have been so universally and firmly anti-Communist. A weakening of their
                            opposition to Communism, in their exposed position, would be a serious
                            matter. The R paper, in considering the effects of a reduction of <gloss

                            of the Far East, estimates that unless reassurances were made through
                            collateral actions these countries would doubt the long-range intentions
                            of the United States in the Far East, and the mainland Southeast Asian
                            states probably would move closer to the Communist bloc, thereby
                            weakening the <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> structure. A
                            reduction of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces would be
                            regarded by interested countries as a move in the direction of exclusive
                            reliance on a strategy of massive retaliation, thus forcing them to
                            reassess their security ties with the United States.</p>
                        <p>The <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName> Committee Report
                            presented as the last of its four alternatives a cut in economic aid.
                            Less study has been given to this alternative than to reducing military
                            aid, partly because the level of economic aid is set in large part by
                            the magnitude of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces.
                            Moreover, reductions in economic aid would stimulate inflation, to the
                            detriment of stability in Korea, would lessen the present rate of
                            investment, thus prolonging the need for outside assistance, and would
                            in many respects work to the immediate detriment of United States

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: I have read with great
                            interest your letter of November 16 [<hi rend="italic">15</hi>],
                                1956,<note n="2" xml:id="d186fn2">Not printed.</note> and have
                            considered most carefully the suggestions you have made. I share your
                            views on the importance of international justice for all states, large
                            and small, and the right of self-determination.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible for me to accept, however, the thesis that because grave
                            violations of these principles have occurred we should now abandon the
                            position that outlawing the use of force is a means of bringing about
                            world peace.</p>
                        <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0383"/>
                        <p>On the contrary, this is the very moment when the potential of the United
                            Nations as an instrument of world opinion has been demonstrated.</p>
                        <p>In the recent developments in Eastern Europe we now see cracks in the
                            Soviet Empire. The gallant Hungarian people have shown that the spirit
                            of freedom is still alive, despite years of Communist oppression. I am
                            convinced that moral force brought to bear on the Soviet Union through
                            the United Nations will assist to an ever increasing degree in
                            moderating and ultimately bringing to an end Soviet oppression. I
                            believe that these moral forces can bring nearer the day of unification
                            and freedom in Korea also.</p>
                        <p>In the present crises, there have been terrible injustices and
                            sufferings. War, which is itself an instrument of injustice, is not the
                            remedy. We continue to look to the United Nations as providing the best
                            alternative to global war and the disaster to victor and vanquished
                            alike which would follow in this day of modern weapons. The actions
                            which the free world must, therefore, pursue should be directed toward
                            supporting and strengthening the United Nations so that it may secure
                            justice and peace through law.</p>
                        <p>May I take up, now, with the utmost frankness your views on expelling the
                            Soviet Union from the United Nations and then reorganizing that body.
                            This course of action has been suggested by others during the past few
                            weeks and has been thoroughly considered.</p>
                        <p>Although I fully recognize that on numerous occasions the Soviet Union
                            has been guilty of defying every principle of the Charter of the United
                            Nations, we must realize that as a practical matter, the veto power of
                            the Soviet Union would prevent its expulsion. Instead of a new
                            organization, I believe the world should work to strengthen the United
                            Nations so that it can effectively impose its collective will for
                            peace.</p>
                        <p>Let me assure you that neither the United States Government nor the
                            American people have any illusions whatsoever regarding the nature and
                            objectives of Communist imperialism. The United States has assisted the
                            free countries in developing and maintaining their political, economic
                            and military strength to thwart the Communist objective of world
                            domination. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to make use of
                            force as a last resort in individual and collective self-defense against
                            aggression. These are times of grave world tension, in which we in the
                            free world must act with calmness and high principle. I have, therefore,
                            welcomed the manner in which you have encouraged a calm resoluteness on
                            the part of your people and your military establishment.</p>
                        <p>I am pleased that you have felt free to write to me on a confidential and
                            personal basis, and I do not plan to give any publicity to our
                            correspondence. I would like to suggest that you treat our communication
                                <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0384"/>in the same way so that we

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> opened the meeting by
                            quoting the piece-for-piece of same type and effectiveness provision of
                            paragraph 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement and stating that in
                            Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName>’s view and the
                            view of the Defense Department, it would be impossible in the long run
                            to construe these words strictly. Modernization of combat materiel would
                            inevitably produce more effective weapons and weapons of dual
                            capability. The case of aircraft is a good example in that they have
                            developed and changed since the agreement was made and they clearly
                            possess atomic capability. Similarly, “Honest <persName>John</persName>”
                            and the 280 mm. gun have both conventional and <pb n="357"
                                xml:id="pg_357" facs="0385"/>atomic capability. While the President
                            would have to decide whether atomic warheads might be introduced into
                            Korea, the Army in the meantime should have the latest types possible
                            and should be permitted to have weapons of dual capability. At Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>’s request, Mr. Runyon
                            briefly outlined the legal position taken by the State Department, as
                            set out in Defense telegram 983878, June 24, 1955,<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d187fn2">See <ref target="#d110fn5">footnote 5, Document
                                    110</ref>.</note> and concurred in previously by Defense.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> asked why Defense had
                            not gone ahead with the introduction of modern equipment consistently
                            with the earlier agreed position. He stated that the time element is an
                            important matter and suggested that the passage of time might eventually
                            make necessary the introduction of equipment not covered by the original
                            agreement. He stated his view as a lawyer that the introduction of
                            “Honest <persName>John</persName>” and the 280 mm. gun would be a
                            violation of paragraph 13(d) and could not be justified as a matter of
                            liberal interpretation, pointing out that the introduction of these
                            weapons would create an imbalance contrary to the overall purpose of
                            paragraph 13 of the agreement, especially inasmuch as we could not
                            establish that there have been similar introductions on the Communist
                            side. He thought this would also be the view of the United Nations. In
                            the last analysis the decision whether to introduce “Honest
                                <persName>John</persName>” and the 280 mm. gun must therefore
                            involve a weighing of the political factors including the political
                            consequences of a violation on our side which could be considered by the
                            Communist side to permit them to treat the Armistice Agreement as
                            abrogated. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> made it
                            clear that he would not maintain that we should forever be bound by an
                            armistice agreement when its terms became outmoded and impossible to
                            live with, but we must be prepared to take the consequences of violating
                            it. He also pointed out that the Communists had breached the agreement,
                            and we were therefore entitled to terminate or suspend it, but if we did
                            so, the Communists would not be bound by the agreement.</p>
                        <p>A general discussion ensued in which the representatives of Defense
                            emphasized the position of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the
                            introduction of the two weapons referred to is essential from a military
                            viewpoint, that it might be argued that Communist violations of
                            paragraph 13(d), especially with respect to aircraft, free us to
                            disregard its restrictions, and that in any event, the weapons should
                            not be regarded as atomic since, when unaccompanied by atomic warheads,
                            such use would be potential and not actual. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_NDG1">Nes</persName> stated that, legal considerations
                            aside, the psychological factor is an important one. The “Honest
                                <persName>John</persName>” and the 280 mm. gun are publicly known as
                            atomic weapons, and an Intelligence survey<note n="3" xml:id="d187fn3"

                            recently completed <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0386"/>in the State
                            Department shows that their introduction into Korea would have serious
                            repercussions among our allies; the reaction in Japan and Australia, for
                            example, would be strongly adverse, and a similarly adverse reaction
                            could be anticipated among the so-called neutral nations and among the
                            members of <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>. Admiral Ward stated
                            that in his view <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss> members would
                            respond favorably to steps by us emphasizing our strength and our
                            determination. Mr. <persName>Leigh</persName> made the point that we
                            might justify the introduction as a suspension of paragraph 13(d). Col.
                            Raymond had earlier referred to the statement which the United Nations
                            Command made in the Military Armistice Commission,<note n="4"
                                xml:id="d187fn4">See <ref target="#d164">Document 164</ref>.</note>
                            and reiterated in its report to the United Nations,<note n="5"

                            violations and affirmed its intention to limit remedial action to the
                            suspension of those provisions of the armistice relating to the
                            operations of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> south of the
                            demilitarized zone.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName> stated our
                            view as lawyers that introduction of the two weapons could not be
                            successfully supported as a matter of liberal interpretation, would
                            upset the balance established under the agreement, and would generally
                            be regarded as a violation of the agreement under existing
                            circumstances. He reaffirmed that the agreement should not, however,
                            stand in the way of any action which it might be considered necessary
                            and wise to take, now or in the future, in view of the military and
                            political situation, and with full awareness of all the consequences.
                            Such a decision, he indicated, would of course have to be taken at a
                            high political level. He again invited the attention of Defense to the
                            desirability of moving ahead with respect to all the other weapons upon
                            which agreement had already been reached. He suggested to the Defense
                            representatives that the matter be discussed with Mr. <persName

                        <p>The State draft was subsequently cleared in Defense and by all the

                            the 280mm gun. The State draft deferred authorizing the introduction of
                            these weapons, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] which, according to <gloss target="#t_L1"
                                >L</gloss>, the United States could not justify within the terms of
                            the Armistice Agreement. Moreover, the introduction of such weapons,
                            particularly at this juncture, would almost surely create serious
                            controversy, in which the United States would undoubtedly be censured
                            not only by the Communists and neutralist countries, but also by the
                            Swiss and Swedes and many of our Allies in Korea.</p>
                        <p>We have made a number of concessions to Defense on this issue,
                            recognizing that it is important to find procedures for replacing
                            obsolete equipment. Except for the Honest <persName>John</persName> and
                            the 280mm gun, we have accepted at face value the Defense statement that
                            the new weapons are as close in effectiveness and type to the obsolete
                            ones as is consistent with modern standards and production, even though
                            to a layman some of the new types appear far removed from those being
                            replaced. A number of the weapons listed for introduction have atomic
                            capabilities: we have taken exception only to those whose atomic
                            capability is widely regarded as the primary feature of the weapon. I do
                            not believe it would be wise for us to agree with Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> that the Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and 280mm gun should be introduced,
                            particularly in this time of world tension. We have attempted to justify
                            our position and have explained the political and legal issues in detail
                            during numerous discussions with Defense. Following a meeting between

                            not believe the United States should expose itself to such charges for
                            the sake of these specific items of equipment.</p>

                        <p>Paragraph 13 d of the Korean Armistice Agreement provides that the
                            opposing sides shall “cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing
                            combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition; provided,
                            however, that combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunition

                            same effectiveness and the same type”. (The full text of paragraph 13 d
                            is set forth at Tab A.)<note n="2" xml:id="d189fn2">Not found

                        <p>Very soon after the Armistice went into force, it became apparent that
                            the Communists had introduced jet aircraft into North <pb n="361"
                                xml:id="pg_361" facs="0389"/>Korea, whereas they had no such
                            aircraft there prior to the Armistice. Moreover, no report of such
                            introductions was made to the Military Armistice Commission. The United
                            States at this time construed the Agreement quite strictly and accused
                            the Communists of violating the Armistice Agreement in this respect.</p>
                        <p>The United States has always adhered to a very strict and literal
                            interpretation of paragraph 13 d. It has only introduced exact
                            equivalents and it has reported all such introductions. As time has gone
                            by U.S. weapons in Korea have become increasingly obsolete. Our
                            commanders in the Far East have strongly recommended that they be
                            permitted to introduce modern weapons and this recommendation has been
                            under consideration for many months within the Government. The Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff have strongly supported, from the military point of
                            view, the recommendations of the field commanders.</p>
                        <p>It should be recalled that the State and Defense Departments agreed
                            provisionally to suspend performance of our obligations to permit the
                            operations of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral
                            Nations Inspection Teams in the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            Command area. This action was taken because of the flagrant disregard by
                            the Communists of this provision of the Armistice insofar as it applied
                            in the Communist area of Korea. This action, moreover, was taken with
                            the concurrence of our British Commonwealth Allies in Korea as is made
                            quite clear in a letter dated May 5, 1956 from the Acting Secretary of
                            State to the Secretary of Defense.<note n="3" xml:id="d189fn3"><ref

                            is stated that the Department of State concurs in the recommendation
                            that General <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> be
                            authorized to replace obsolete and worn out equipment by appropriate
                            replacements on the theory that this can be accomplished legally within
                            the terms of paragraph 13 d of the Armistice Agreement “as a matter of
                            interpretation of the Agreement in the light of the actions of the other
                            side”. It was further agreed that the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            should report all introductions made.</p>
                        <p>Following this understanding between the two Departments, a proposed
                            replacement list was prepared in the Defense Department and submitted to
                            the State Department in the form of a suggested cable to General
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName>. A copy of the
                            proposed cable is attached at Tab B.<note n="4" xml:id="d189fn4">Not
                                found attached.</note> The list of replacement items and the theory
                            on which the replacements would be made have been agreed between the two
                            Departments in all respects except that the State Department is
                            unwilling to agree to the introduction of the Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and the 280mm gun. The two items in
                            dispute are dual purpose weapons which can accommodate either
                            conventional or atomic shells. The Defense Department <pb n="362"
                                xml:id="pg_362" facs="0390"/>is not at this time seeking to have
                            atomic warheads introduced.</p>
                        <p>The objections of the State Department are political and legal. It takes
                            the position that these weapons are identified in the minds of the
                            people of the world as atomic weapons and that their introduction—and
                            the report thereof—(at this time) would produce serious adverse
                            reactions against the United States throughout the world and would open
                            the way for the Communists to accuse the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command and the United States of breaching the
                            Armistice. On the legal side, the State Department lawyers take the
                            position that the introduction of the two disputed items could not be
                            regarded as legally justifiable under Article 13 d unless it could be
                            demonstrated that the Communists had done the same thing on their side
                            of the line. In response to a specific request, the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff in a memorandum of October 19, 1956 stated “There is no evidence
                            to substantiate the reports of the existence of atomic warheads or
                            atomic ground delivery systems in North Korea. However, since the
                            signing of the Armistice, the Communists have introduced modern arms and
                            equipment into North Korea. Communist aircraft having atomic delivery
                            capability and additional atomic delivery systems could be deployed to
                            North Korea on short notice.”<note n="5" xml:id="d189fn5">Memorandum

                            Defense Department General Counsel considers that the introduction of
                            the two disputed items could be legally justified at this time. Under
                            all the circumstances, paragraph 13 d must be given a practical
                            interpretation. In view of the fact that we will have to live with the
                            Armistice for the indefinite future, it would be self-defeating to
                            insist on an interpretation which required a 1953 model weapon to be
                            replaced in 1956 or even in 1966 with a weapon no longer in current
                            production.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that both the Legal Adviser of the State
                            Department and the General Counsel of the Defense Department are in
                            complete agreement that this problem is not one to be determined on the
                            legal issues. Instead, they both consider that the decision to be made
                            is a political and military one. They have recommended that the problem
                            be resolved on this basis at the highest level.</p>
                        <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as this office, view with the utmost
                            concern the fact that a considerable period of time has now passed
                            without any practical steps having been taken toward modernization of
                            the forces in Korea. The situation of the Far East commander is becoming
                            increasingly disadvantageous and in time will become intolerable. Under
                            the circumstances, we believe it is imperative that modern weapons be
                            introduced even though they have an atomic capability. In this respect,
                            the 280mm gun and the Honest <pb n="363" xml:id="pg_363" facs="0391"

                            series aircraft which are already approved by the Department of State in
                            the undisputed portion of the list. We further believe the legal
                            justification for the introduction of the whole list is sound and the
                            possibility that the Communists will charge a breach should not deter
                            the United States from moving because such a charge is probable if we
                            modernize at all regardless of whether the Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and the 280mm gun are on the list.</p>

                            the world behaved itself. None of them, to my mind, is susceptive of
                            ready presentation or analysis, and I still hope it may be possible for
                            me to get back to the Department for a brief consultation sometime after
                            the first of the year—which is another way of saying that I feel very

                        <p>With this wordy introduction, here are my comments on the points in your

                            <item><p>I find myself somewhere between the Department and Defense on
                                    the weapons issue, although I feel the difference is primarily
                                    of an optical nature. I should have explained that my plug for
                                    Honest John or Nike batteries was based on the popular
                                    acceptance in most countries of these weapons as simply guided
                                    missiles without regard to their atomic capability. I assume
                                    this has something to do with our rather off-hand publicity
                                    about missiles, whereas there is considerably more hush-hush
                                    treatment (at least by the uninitiated, like me) of the “atomic
                                    bomb.” At any rate, it seems to me possible that we might equip
                                    our own forces here with the missiles—with conventional
                                    warheads—without too much public outcry from anyone except the
                                    Communists. And the latter are bound to make the most of any
                                    change in the present situation, be it in a musket or in the
                                    addition of the latest [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                        source text not declassified</hi>] weapon. I would think
                                    that much might depend upon our advance publicity, and how we
                                    built up to an announcement of our ultimate decision.</p>
                                <p>I admit that I could be wrong about this, of course.</p></item>

                                        recommended the maintenance of U.S. forces “at substantially
                                        their present strength until unification has been achieved.”
                                        For economic reasons, however, they recommended a gradual
                                        but steady reduction in the size of the South Korean armed
                                        forces by conversion of active into reserve units.

                                    getting the necessary funds for their maintenance. There was
                                    some difference of opinion on this subject in the Pentagon when
                                    I was last in Washington, but I take it from your letter that at
                                    least the <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> have reached an

                                <p>Having said as much, I should like to make it
                                    clear—informally—that I would be opposed to the maintenance of
                                    the present force levels even if adequate <gloss

                                    available under existing procedures. I would have no argument
                                    against the present levels if it were possible in some manner
                                    for us to assume <pb n="365" xml:id="pg_365" facs="0393"/>the
                                    burden of supporting them, less a modest, fixed sum in hwan
                                    assessed against the Korean budget for defense purposes, and
                                    could thus sterilize the present unhealthy impact on the Korean
                                    economy. As I see it, the existing aid laws and regulations were
                                    not drawn up with a Korean-type situation in mind, and their
                                    application here is bringing results which we had certainly not
                                    intended. To illustrate, let’s take the items of “saleables” in
                                    the economic aid program, the composition of which has, I fear,
                                    been determined as much by what the economy can absorb so as to
                                    generate hwan to cover the military budget deficit as by
                                    essential import requirements of the economy. I should add, in
                                    fairness, that another criterion has been their effect in
                                    combatting inflation, but I believe the economists agree that
                                    the military budget itself is a major factor making for that
                                    inflation.</p>
                                <p>I do not argue for a change in the laws and regulations to fit
                                    our situation here. That, I know, is hardly practicable. Hence
                                    my conclusion that we must reduce the force levels, while
                                    changing their composition to get the most effective defense
                                    possible for the funds which can be made available. My
                                    rationalization is that while this may not supply all the
                                    defense needed, it will give us all we can afford if we are to
                                    have any chance of developing the Korean economy, and that the
                                    situation is now sufficiently stabilized for us to take this
                                    calculated risk. So long as U.S. forces stand on the front here,
                                    I do not believe we shall see aggression against us unless it be
                                    part of a global offensive. In this latter case, we should be in
                                    a most untenable position here, even with the present
                                    forces.</p>
                                <p>To me, the fundamental decision is whether we shall have here
                                    merely an armed camp, or if it is to be our purpose to strike a
                                    balance between military and political economic security, and do
                                    the best we can in both fields through a judicious apportioning
                                    of the available resources.</p></item>

                            <item>On the question of succession, I agree that as things now stand,
                                the constitutional processes would be followed, and <persName
                                    corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName> would take over. There
                                would no doubt follow some months of political confusion, but I do
                                not believe it would result in any serious difficulty for us or the
                                Koreans; this would, in my opinion, be nothing more than the
                                realignment of forces which must be expected.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>I should, however, like to sound one note of caution: the Army, on which
                            we have counted as a major element of stability, may not function as we
                            have planned. I am disturbed by the high degree of factionalism which is
                            now rife (the Air Force and Navy seem as yet to be singularly free from
                            this virus), and I am ready to confess that I haven’t the slightest idea
                            how it will all end. As I see it, the infection is fed by the fact that
                            the build-up having been completed, the Army is now finding time heavy
                            on its hands (lack of funds for <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0394"
                            />training, etc.), and especially is this true of the officers who have
                            attained the highest or next highest military rank at such early ages.
                            It is perhaps natural, in this situation, that a realization should dawn
                            of the imposing influence which could be wielded by one controlling the
                            Army, and that dreams of power should follow in the wake of this
                            realization. The struggle seems to be on, in any event, and it may or
                            may not do damage. I can only say that I view with alarm.</p>
                        <p>One further thought on succession. The Liberal Party is endeavoring to
                            rebuild after the shock of the last national elections, and have
                            demonstrated better organization in several by-elections recently. If
                            they succeed in this reconstruction program, and especially if they
                            should sense that they are re-gaining the confidence of the electorate,
                            they will almost surely attempt to change the rules and exclude
                                <persName corresp="#p_CMJMC1">Chang Myon</persName> from the
                            Presidency. This is something on which we can only wait and see.</p>
                        <p>As I said at the beginning of this letter, these matters are not
                            susceptible of ready presentation or analysis. After reading over my
                            comments above, I should perhaps amend that statement to say that I am
                            not capable of presenting or analyzing them coherently. There is a great
                            deal more I could say, and I might well want to amend or clarify some of
                            my statements in the light of your questions. But I hope that what I
                            have given you will be of some use.</p>

                                >Rhee</persName> expressed his views on three principal subjects—the
                            desirability of denouncing the Armistice; the position of the United
                            States vis-à-vis Communist expansion and brutality; and Japanese-<gloss

                        <p>For ten minutes or so after Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s arrival, the President indulged in small
                            talk. He appeared hesitant about introducing substantive <pb n="368"
                                xml:id="pg_368" facs="0396"/>topics. Eventually, he said he had many
                            questions to ask and wished Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> could remain for a week during which these
                            questions could be discussed. When urged by Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to proceed, Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> declared the time had come to
                            denounce the Armistice. He said the Koreans’ hands were tied;
                            unification had not been achieved; the Communists were building up their
                            forces in the North; the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s were
                            prevented from strengthening their forces because the United States
                            adhered to the Armistice Agreement. He said Admiral <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> had told him the United States
                            had the weapons needed to strengthen the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces but was prevented from turning over these
                            weapons by strict adherence to the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> stressed the dangers
                            inherent in the location of the truce line. He said Communist forces
                            were so close to Inchon that in case of hostilities Seoul could be
                            quickly encircled. He spoke at length of the brutality and ruthlessness
                            of the Communists; said the population of North Korea had been
                            substantially reduced because people who did not accept the regime were
                            killed. He reminded his listeners of the savagery of the Communist
                            troops when they invaded South Korea, and mentioned Communist violations
                            of the Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> what he thought would happen if the
                            Armistice Agreement were denounced. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> said the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
                            not go to war “the day after”, but having been freed from the
                            restrictions of the Armistice Agreement would see what could be done
                            about unification.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out the
                            advantages of abiding by the Armistice Agreement. He reminded Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that in view of the
                            United States-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> mutual security
                            arrangements the Communists would not attack South Korea until such time
                            as they were prepared to fight the United States and 15 other <gloss
                                target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> nations who were pledged to come to the
                            aid of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked what, in view of these
                            circumstances, could be gained by a denunciation of the Agreement. Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> then launched into a
                            discussion of the worldwide threat of Communist power, and said the
                            Communists were counting upon the fact America would not fight. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded him that
                            many Americans had died in Korea in defense of the liberty of his
                            country.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> discussed at length his
                            view that Communist power was extending itself in many parts of the
                            world without effective opposition from the United States. In this
                            connection, he mentioned current developments in the Middle East and
                            asked why the Russians were being allowed to crush the Hungarian revolt
                            without interference by the United States. He said people were being
                            murdered <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0397"/>in Hungary but the
                            United States simply said, “<persName corresp="#p_YCYD1">You</persName>
                            are very brave,” and offered money for relief.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> reminded Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> of what the United States
                            was doing to deter Communist expansion; that we had mutual security
                            treaties with more than thirty nations threatened by Communist
                            power—including Korea, Vietnam and the Chinese Republic; that we had put
                            the Communists on notice that if they attacked these countries the
                            United States would come to their assistance. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> told Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that the horrors of thermo-nuclear
                            warfare defied imagination; that people who would not be killed by
                            explosions would likely be killed or maimed by the fall-out; that anyone
                            who had attended a briefing on thermo-nuclear weapons realized that a
                            thermo-nuclear war could literally destroy civilization. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said our President would
                            never be responsible for starting such a war.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said he wished he could
                            talk to the President. He said he felt the President had an opportunity
                            to assume a position of strong moral leadership. With reference to a
                            remark by Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> to the
                            effect that Communist power is deterred by fear of the atomic
                            superiority of the United States, Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> asked why the President did not utilize fear of
                            American power to stop the Communist powers from threatening the
                            countries on their borders, and from treating people the way they were
                            treating the Hungarians. He said that as a result of its present policy
                            the United States was losing prestige throughout the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the United
                            States was fully aware of the evils of Communism and hated Communism
                            just as much as Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, but the
                            President hoped to solve the problem by peaceful means. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that Communism
                            was so evil that it carried the seeds of its own destruction and
                            eventually would destroy itself. He said there were already cracks in
                            the Communist structure. Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            repeated his fear that if the United States simply stood by while the
                            Communists behaved as they pleased, and hoped that some day the
                            Communist orbit and the rest of the world would be friends, the
                            Communists would win the struggle. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> made it clear that the United States was not
                            counting on the Communist orbit’s becoming friends, and was well aware
                            of their goal of world domination. He reiterated the fact that the
                            President believed his present policy was best for the Free World, and
                            reminded Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that we expected
                            our Allies to make every effort to solve their problems peacefully.</p>
                        <p>In this connection, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            told Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> started hostilities it could not expect
                            the support of the United States and other United Nations. He reminded
                            Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that when the British and
                            French resorted to hostilities in Egypt, the United States refused <pb
                                n="370" xml:id="pg_370" facs="0398"/>to support them. He said the
                            British and French had mounted their attack without any consultation
                            with the United States; and that we could not allow ourselves to be
                            forced by our Allies into actions which we would not have approved had
                            we been consulted.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> said the British were a
                            treacherous nation, and always had been, and added that the Japanese
                            were treacherous. He said they wanted to reconquer Korea, and they were
                            even worse enemies than the Communists. He complained that the United
                            States allowed them to go ahead and re-establish relations with Soviet
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said the United
                            States did not make a practice of telling other nations what to do—that
                            it was not our policy to try to dictate to other countries.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> cited his familiar
                            grievances—real and imagined— against the Japanese. When he alleged that
                            the Japanese were building a new military machine with American aid, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            while the presence of American troops in Japan had brought certain
                            economic advantages, Japan was not receiving any economic aid from the
                            United States and, furthermore, seemed unwilling to appropriate funds
                            for anything resembling a substantial military establishment. When Dr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> condemned the Japanese
                            for claiming “85% of Korean assets”, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> said that in so far as he was aware the
                            Japanese had not made such a claim. When Dr. <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> asked why the United States did not see to it that
                            the Japanese lived up to the San Francisco Treaty and why it did not
                            assume a position on Japanese claims, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> and the Ambassador reminded Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> that the United States had taken a
                            position, and that this had been communicated to the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> then asked why the United States
                            did not make this position public.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> why the Koreans and the Japanese
                            could not sit around a table and settle their differences. Dr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> alleged that the Japanese were
                            unwilling to do so.</p>
                        <p>At this point the Ambassador reminded Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> that a briefing by certain Cabinet members had
                            been scheduled for five o’clock.<note n="2" xml:id="d192fn2"

                                Republic of Korea. The Minister of Reconstruction proposed
                                denunciation of the Armistice, and <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                    >Robertson</persName> responded, as he had with President

                                essential until the present Armistice Agreement is replaced by a
                                more permanent arrangement. In addition, the operational control
                                exercised by the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> over the <gloss

                                unilateral military action. If the <gloss target="#t_UNC1"

                            <item>In your memorandum of 7 November you requested that the Joint
                                Chiefs of Staff consider the minimum level of forces in Korea under
                                the assumption that neither (a) the maintenance of internal
                                political stability, nor (b) the element of precipitous action by
                                the Korean Government are involved. It is impossible to separate
                                economic and political factors from military considerations when the
                                United States is responsible for providing practically all the
                                equipment and supplies and for training and guidance of the <gloss

                            <item>The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the upheaval and
                                disruption which may very well occur during the choice of a
                                successor to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                                could, and probably would, open Korea to internal strife and to
                                infiltration by the Communists, thus placing the U.S. <pb n="372"
                                    xml:id="pg_372" facs="0400"/>position, not only in Korea but
                                throughout the Far East, in jeopardy. A firm control over the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces during this period, such as
                                is currently provided by the United Nations Commander, is mandatory
                                from a military viewpoint in order to safeguard U.S. interests.
                                Although it is possible that unilateral <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> military action is sufficiently remote as to be
                                assumed out of consideration, this does not eliminate the grave
                                military danger to the United States should such an action take
                                place. For the above reasons, the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that
                                safeguarding against the two possible situations outlined above is
                                of sufficient military importance to demand full consideration in
                                the establishment of any force levels for Korea.</item>

                            <item>From a long-range viewpoint, it is not militarily feasible to
                                reduce the deterrent force in South Korea until an atomic equipped

                                feasible to support the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army
                                with a U.S. atomic capable ground force, it may well be that further
                                reductions in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S. forces in

                        <p>On January 8, 1957, the First Committee of the U.N. General Assembly
                            completed 6 days of debate on the Korean question. Debate on the
                            question developed along well-established lines, with a general tendency
                            to deplore the lack of progress toward Korean unification, but with no
                            new proposals to break the stalemate established by the Armistice
                            Agreement. The Representatives of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Soviet
                            Union condemned the May 31 decision of the Unified Command to remove the
                                <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams to the demilitarized
                            zone, but the decision and the August 15 report by the <pb n="373"

                            did not become the focus of debate on the Korean question.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of debate, the First Committee, by a vote of 57–8 with
                            13 abstentions, adopted a draft resolution submitted by the United
                            States which provided that the General Assembly would continue to pursue
                            the goal of a unified, independent, and democratic Korea; would endorse
                            the continuing work of <gloss target="#t_UNCURK1">UNCURK</gloss> in
                            Korea; and would request the Secretary-General to place the Korean
                            question on the agenda for the twelfth session of the General Assembly.
                            (U.N. doc. A/3490) First Committee debate on the Korean question is in
                            U.N. docs. A/C.1/SR.814 through A/C.1/SR.820. On January 11, the General
                            Assembly, by a vote of 57–8 with 9 abstentions, adopted the report of
                            the First Committee as Resolution 1010 A (XI).</p>

                            <head>EVALUATION OF ALTERNATIVE MILITARY PROGRAMS FOR KOREA</head>
                            <p rend="center">General Considerations</p>
                            <p>1. The Republic of Korea depends on U.S. support for its military
                                defense, but does not consider the Mutual Defense Treaty and the
                                Joint Policy Declaration sufficient assurance that the United States
                                will in fact defend South Korea in the event of an attack from the
                                North. Koreans remember the U.S. withdrawal from South Korea shortly
                                prior to the attack in 1950, and believe that sizeable U.S. combat
                                forces and strong <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                                forces must be maintained in South Korea to deter a new attack by
                                Communist forces and to assure the defense of the area in case of
                                attack.</p>
                            <p>2. With little complaint, the Koreans have made heavy sacrifices, in
                                the form of taxation and conscription, in support of their military
                                forces. The Korean will to resist is universally high; indeed the
                                Korean political and military leaders would have continued or
                                reopened hostilities with North Korea had not U.S. officials
                                frequently reminded them that U.S. logistical support, essential to
                                successful military action, would not be forthcoming. However, the
                                Korean will to resist can be expected to remain high only as long as
                                the Korean people and their leaders are convinced that the United
                                States is supporting them fully and that they have the military
                                capacity to resist.</p>
                            <p>3. However, Korean faith in the U.S. defense commitment is not
                                necessarily related to any particular U.S. or <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force level, provided the South
                                Koreans believe that joint U.S.-<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                capabilities are sufficient to give assurance of an intent to resist
                                aggression and to permit effective outside assistance to be brought
                                to bear.</p>
                            <p>4. If <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces are placed on the
                                3-year rotation basis in the near future, it may be difficult to
                                maintain present active strength unless the number of personnel
                                deciding to make a career of military service increases greatly. The
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army has already returned
                                most of its personnel with combat experience to civilian life and
                                currently is having almost no success in persuading junior officers
                                and enlisted men to make a career of the military service. The lack
                                of a core of experienced professional soldiers in the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army places severe limitations on
                                its future ability to use and maintain the more advanced and complex
                                weapons which soon will be indispensable for effective military
                                operations.</p>
                            <p>5. In November, 1954 the United States and the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> initialed an Agreed Minute in which
                                it was stated that as the training load <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376"
                                    facs="0404"/>diminishes and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                trained reserve strengths are attained, the total number of active
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military personnel will be
                                adjusted according-</p>
                            <p>6. Korean confidence in the U.S. commitment to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> will also be affected by the extent
                                of U.S. economic aid available for economic development. The Korean
                                economy is recovering from war devastation, but only limited
                                progress is being made in economic development; in the long run this
                                could pose a serious threat to political stability. A commitment to
                                continue the current level of economic development aid or an
                                increase therein would probably be considered by the Koreans as a
                                good indication that the U.S. Government has confidence in the
                                future of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. While a
                                simultaneous major reduction in both economic development and
                                military assistance to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would
                                no doubt have very serious and adverse repercussions in Korea,
                                particularly since the Koreans believe that Communist capabilities
                                have been increasing since the Armistice was signed, a military
                                reduction under the applicable proviso of the Agreed Minute could
                                probably be compensated in part, but only in part, by a long-term
                                economic aid commitment or an increase in economic aid.</p>
                            <p>7. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S. military forces in
                                South Korea are a major symbol of U.S. determination to resist
                                further Communist expansion in the Far East. Other symbols include
                                U.S. commitments in <gloss target="#t_SEATO1">SEATO</gloss>, the
                                Republic of China and the Philippines; U.S. aid to non-Communist
                                Asian countries; U.S. military capabilities and commitments in the
                                Taiwan area, the Philippines, Japan and Okinawa; and the fact of
                                U.S. participation in the Korean war. Moreover, the Free World
                                through the Sixteen Power Declaration and <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                    >UN</gloss> Command in Korea is committed to resist renewal of
                                Communist aggression against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>8. The objective of the Communists continues to be to gain control
                                over the entire Korean peninsula. They probably will not resort to
                                force to obtain this objective, at least so long as the United
                                States retains forces in South Korea and remains committed to the
                                defense of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>.<note n="8"

                                        target="#d159">Document 159</ref>.</note> On the other hand,
                                the Communists almost surely will not yield in any significant
                                respect in maintaining their control over North Korea, thus
                                continuing a situation of tension and instability. Although the
                                Communists might reduce their active forces in Korea following any
                                major reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, they
                                would retain the capability quickly to rebuild their strength to
                                present levels by the mobilization of trained reserves and by the
                                introduction of Communist forces from outside Korea.</p>

                            <p>10. Continuation of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military
                                establishment and U.S. forces in Korea at present levels would
                                continue to satisfy the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders
                                of U.S. intentions to defend the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>. This involves no violation of the Korean Armistice
                                Agreement. Although present U.S. programs involve replacement of
                                obsolete equipment, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> leaders
                                want an army and an air force at least equivalent in size and
                                equipment to Communist forces deployed in North Korea, and they
                                would continue to press for such improvements.</p>
                            <p>11. U.S. allies in Asia would interpret this policy as an indication
                                of continued U.S. determination to maintain a strong anti-Communist
                                position in Asia. The Asian neutrals would continue to contend that
                                U.S. policy misinterprets the real threat to Asian stability and
                                security by over-emphasis on military aid and under-emphasis on
                                economic aid.</p>
                            <p>12. The Communists would continue to believe that the United States
                                would commit its forces to defend the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss>.</p>

                            <p>13. The South Korean economy would probably be in trouble today even
                                if there were no <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military force.
                                It seems clear, however, that the need for very large sums of local
                                currency for this force has (1) contributed to the very heavy
                                inflationary pressures which divert businessmen from productive
                                enterprises to speculation, (2) forced a larger use of economic aid
                                for military purposes, and (3) by requiring heavy imports, promoted
                                artificially high levels of consumption. Local currency costs are
                                increasing and will continue in future years to increase due to
                                greater maintenance and replacement needs to keep the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military force in top condition,
                                increased food prices, particularly rice, and higher military pay.
                                The future may bring greater pressure on the end-use of local
                                currency generation as between military and investment to the
                                detriment of the latter unless total economic assistance is
                                increased. So long as present military programs are continued,
                                therefore, it is likely that there will be no acceleration in the
                                rate of Korean economic development and thus no reduction in South
                                Korean unemployment and no prospect of an assumption by the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of a greater share of its military
                                and economic support. The annual requirement for U.S. aid is,
                                therefore, <pb n="379" xml:id="pg_379" facs="0407"/>growing rather
                                than diminishing. The cost of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                forces, however, is only a fraction of the cost of equivalent U.S.
                                forces.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military</hi></p>
                            <p>14. This alternative precludes complete modernization of U.S. forces
                                in Korea. U.S. units in Korea cannot be reorganized to conform with
                                the organizational structure of other comparable U.S. units, which
                                are acquiring a dual conventional-nuclear capability. As a result,
                                U.S. forces in Korea are forced to adhere to certain outmoded
                                tactical concepts. This has an adverse effect upon the morale of
                                troops assigned to Korea and denies the most efficient and effective
                                utilization of U.S. military manpower.</p>
                            <p>15. The Republic of Korea Army, with 20 active and 10 reserve Army
                                divisions and other listed forces, would be capable of maintaining
                                internal security. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and U.S.
                                forces in Korea would be capable of resisting aggression by North
                                Korea alone. A military force of this strength would also be a
                                deterrent to any Communist attack unless such an attack were part of
                                an over-all Communist plan for world-wide military operations. Such
                                a force, with limited U.S. air, naval and logistic support, could
                                conduct a successful holding operation against an attack by those
                                North Korean and Chinese Communist forces now estimated to be in
                                North Korea. Against the combined Chinese Communist forces now in
                                Korea, Chinese Communist forces immediately available in Manchuria
                                and Northeast China and the North Korean forces, the forces would be
                                incapable of conducting a sustained defense without prompt military
                                assistance from the United States. The small <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> Air Force is capable only of limited air support
                                for ground operations. Its aircraft strength is markedly inferior to
                                that of the North Korean Air Force.</p>

                                object to a cut of approximately 20 percent in their active military
                                force levels regardless of a simultaneous modernization of U.S.
                                forces in Korea to include dual purpose weapons. A 20 percent cut in
                                the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army could have sharp
                                effects within the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> if it were
                                interpreted as merely an initial step in U.S. reductions in the Far
                                East. However, these effects would be somewhat reduced by an
                                increase in U.S. military capabilities in Korea. Modernization of
                                U.S. forces would lead to increased <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> pressure for modernization of their forces. <gloss

                                    xml:id="pg_380" facs="0408"/>programs. This would help meet the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> objection of increased
                                economic hardship and additional unemployment resulting from
                                military force reductions.</p>
                            <p>17. Our Asian allies’ assessment of U.S. policy and intentions will
                                depend on over-all U.S. policy and military posture in Asia as well
                                as on changes in levels of U.S. defense aid to South Korea. On
                                balance, our Asian allies would approve any modernization of U.S.
                                forces in Korea reconcilable with the Armistice Agreement. They
                                would interpret such action as an indication of continued U.S.
                                determination to resist Communist advances in Asia. However, if
                                “modernization” were to be carried to a point which they would
                                consider a significant violation of the Armistice Agreement, there
                                would be adverse reactions. In Japan there would be a particularly
                                serious reaction to the equipping of U.S. forces in Korea with what
                                would be regarded as atomic weapons.</p>
                            <p>18. The United States would be strongly censured for violation of the
                                Armistice Agreement by the Swiss and Swedish members of the Neutral
                                Nations Supervisory Commission, and by many of the signatories of
                                the Joint Declaration, as well as by Asian neutrals. These immediate
                                reactions would weaken the U.S. position substantially in the United
                                Nations and in relations with allies and neutrals alike.</p>
                            <p>19. The Communists would react to the introduction of any additional
                                types of dual purpose weapons by launching a major propaganda
                                campaign which would include charges that the United States was
                                violating the Armistice, was seeking to increase tensions in the Far
                                East, and was planning to use again atomic bombs on Asians. The
                                Communists might supplement their propaganda campaign and seek to
                                increase pressure on the United States to withdraw its forces from
                                South Korea by withdrawing the Chinese Communist troops from North
                                Korea, which they could do without critically weakening their
                                military position. The Soviets may introduce dual purpose weapons
                                into North Korea, either overtly or covertly.</p>

                            <p>20. The direct financial savings which would result from reduction of
                                any given number of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions is
                                at best a rough estimate, since little information from the field is
                                available. On the basis of past budgets such savings are averaged
                                for this purpose at $9 million per division in dollars and $7.5
                                million in hwan. This figure of $16.5 million may be overstated
                                since it does not include the cost of conversion of active to
                                reserve divisions. Conversely, this figure may be understated since
                                it does not take into account the current sharply rising trend in
                                maintenance costs. However, using this figure, Alternative B would
                                result in gross financial savings of $65 million ($35 <pb n="381"
                                    xml:id="pg_381" facs="0409"/>million in MAP, $30 million in
                                local currency support). This estimate of savings does not take
                                account of the cost of providing U.S. forces with dual purpose
                                weapons, which are to be purchased in any case.</p>
                            <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Military</hi></p>
                            <p>21. This course of action enables U.S. forces to be reorganized in
                                accordance with latest approved doctrines. It also authorizes the
                                equipping of these forces with modern equipment and with weapons
                                possessing both a conventional and atomic capability. This would
                                result in the most efficient and effective utilization of U.S.
                                military manpower in Korea, and would bolster the morale of U.S.
                                troops assigned to Korea.</p>
                            <p>22. The Republic of Korea Army, with 16 active divisions and 14
                                reserve divisions, would be capable of maintaining internal
                                security. Provided the present U.S. forces in Korea are modernized
                                and the 14 reserve divisions reach and maintain their strength and
                                training goals, the forces projected would be superior in both
                                offensive and defensive capabilities to the North Korean forces
                                alone. Therefore, they would be capable of successfully resisting
                                North Korean aggression. They would provide a very strong deterrent
                                to combined North Korean-Chinese Communist aggression unless this
                                aggression was part of a much broader Communist plan. They would be
                                capable, with limited U.S. outside support, of conducting a
                                successful holding operation against the combined Chinese Communist
                                forces and North Korean Army forces now estimated to be in North
                                Korea. Should the Communists exercise their estimated reinforcing
                                capability with Chinese Communist troops immediately available from
                                Manchuria and Northeast China, the forces considered under this
                                alternative could not maintain a successful resistance without
                                immediate and substantial U.S. military assistance.</p>

                            <p>25. The Communists would probably react less sharply than in

                            <p>26. Potential direct gross savings, based on the same calculation as
                                under Alternative B, would be $165 million annually ($90 million in
                                MAP and $75 million in local currency support). Initially, savings
                                in military aid would be partly offset by the cost of providing the
                                    <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> with additional equipment
                                and weapons, including dual-capability weapons. When a program of
                                troop reduction and matériel and weapons build-up is completed,
                                annual maintenance costs should be reduced as compared with existing
                                maintenance costs.</p>
                            <p>27. The savings in local currency support could be employed in a
                                variety of ways toward greater economic development of Korea, or
                                could be retained by the United States as savings, or could be
                                divided between the two purposes. In the first case, after a short

                                development in Korea might proceed at a somewhat faster pace than
                                now and might in the long run reduce the need for external economic

                            <p>29. The forces, as proposed under this alternative, would be capable

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> noted that the
                            existing rate of 500 hwan per dollar has been in existence since August
                            1955 and that during this period there has been some rise in the Korean
                            price level. Many people within the U.S. Government, he said, believe
                            that the exchange rate should be raised. At the same time, he said, the
                            United States appreciates the efforts made by the Republic of Korea to
                            maintain financial stability and the cooperation which has existed
                            towards this end between officials of Korea and the United States. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said although
                            economists might argue about some of the adverse consequences which can
                            result from not having a realistic exchange rate, it is the view within
                            the U.S. Government, taking into account all pertinent considerations,
                            including the proposals of Korea regarding the exchange rate, and the
                            excellent record and efforts of Korea to maintain financial stability
                            during the past year, that the U.S. will agree to continuation of the
                            500 to 1 rate for 1957. At the end of the year, he said, should the
                            wholesale price index show a change of 25 percent or more either upwards
                            or downwards as compared with the September 1955 average of the index,
                            the exchange rate would be adjusted in the same direction. Thereafter,
                            he said, the U.S. believes the exchange rate should be reviewed every
                            six months. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said
                            that it seems advisable to continue the 500 to 1 rate for 1957 in view
                            of past Korean efforts to maintain its validity, and that its further
                            continuation similarly will depend principally on Korean actions.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> said that Korea certainly would do its
                            best to maintain financial stability and will cooperate fully with the
                            U.S. in this regard. He said that Korea considers 1957 a critical test
                            year. He noted that since August 15, 1955, when the 500 to 1 rate went
                            into existence, until a few months ago, the price structure remained
                            rather steady; in recent months due to a bad rice crop the price
                            structure started to climb. However, since it has become known that
                            Korea would get grains under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480,
                            rice prices already have started to decline, and, he said, he believed
                            they would decline further if rice shipments arrived in Korea
                            expeditiously.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that
                            inflationary pressures will exist in Korea as long as the country has to
                            support an army of 700,000 men. The inflation, he said, really was a
                            by-product of this military operation and not due to the exchange rate.
                            He said that it was in Korea’s own interest, after taking another look
                            at the 500 to 1 rate, to make an <pb n="386" xml:id="pg_386" facs="0414"
                            />adjustment in the future if this is required since it was impossible
                            by fiat to make any exchange rate stick. The United States and Korea
                            both, he said, are taking a calculated risk. The U.S. objective in
                            Korea, he said, is to get the most viable economy possible and the
                            establishment of any particular rate should not be interpreted as an
                            advantage to either one side or the other. The U.S., he said, is
                            abdicating its doubts in view of the excellent results obtained in Korea
                            during the last 15 months.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Han</persName> expressed appreciation on the behalf of
                            Korean Ambassador Yang. He said that he was pleased that the U.S. was
                            going ahead with the 500 to 1 rate extension despite some doubts and
                            that this speaks well of the United States and Korea as working as a
                            team. He said that he thought Korea had done well in the last 15 months
                            and that he believed the Korean Government could in the future be kept
                            on a sound footing. He stressed what he said was the psychological
                            importance to the population of Korea of maintaining the existing
                            exchange rate. He noted that Korea must maintain its army as long as
                            existing dangers continue, but that some day he hoped there could be an
                            over-all solution. Minister <persName>Han</persName> said that he
                            appreciated the willingness of the U.S. to concur with the extension of
                            the existing rate, and that he is sure Korea will prove worthy of the
                            confidence placed in it.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> left the
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Moyer</persName> noted that he and several other persons
                            present had attended the exchange rate discussions in 1955 and that as a
                            result he took an unusual interest in the successful Korean effort to
                            improve its inflationary situation. He said that much soul searching was
                            involved in agreeing to the present exchange rate continuation and that
                            many persons in the U.S. are questioning whether this really is the
                            wisest course for Korea in its own national interest.</p>
                        <p>Dr. <persName>Moyer</persName> said that grain prices are an important
                            element in Korea’s price structure and that he was pleased that Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName> felt Korea could control these prices with
                            the help of grain supplied under <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss>
                            480. He noted that Korea was also thinking of purchasing rice from
                            commercial sources. He said he hoped, should the grain situation
                            threaten the entire price structure in Korea, that Korea would cooperate
                            with the U.S. in reprogramming of aid supplies where necessary. Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName> responded that there was no question but
                            that the Korean Government would do everything possible to keep the
                            grain prices under control since such action was in its own best
                            interests.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> said that the decision
                            on the exchange rate must, of course, be formalized. He noted that the
                            U.S. Embassy in Seoul received <pb n="387" xml:id="pg_387" facs="0415"
                            />a letter dated August 29, 1956<note n="9" xml:id="d197fn9">Not found
                                in Department of State files.</note> from Acting Foreign Minister
                            Cho of Korea in which the latter asked for extension of the rate through
                            December 1957 and proposed certain actions which the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> on its part would take. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> said that the matter could be
                            formalized either by instructing the Embassy in Seoul to answer Minister
                            Cho’s letter or that an instrument could be drawn up for finalization
                            here. In the latter case, he said, the Embassy would at some future date
                            acknowledge Minister Cho’s letter merely noting that the action
                            requested had been completed.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Han</persName> said that Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName> has full authority to sign any agreement.
                            It was arranged that a draft of the proposed U.S. note would be given
                            informally on January 18 to the Korean Embassy for possible signing on
                            January 23 when Minister <persName>Kim</persName> returned from New York
                            to Washington.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> reviewed the pertinent
                            portions of the U.S. note: 1) extension of the current 500 to 1 rate to
                            December 31, 1957; 2) at the end of 1957 the average of the Seoul
                            wholesale price index for the period July 1–December 31, 1957 would be
                            compared with the average of the index for September 1955; 3) if the
                            July–December 31, 1957 average index was 25 percent or more at variance
                            with the September 1955 base there would be an automatic adjustment of
                            the exchange rate as of January 20, 1958 unless some other course of
                            action were mutually agreed upon; 4) following 1957, the average of the
                            index for the six months ending June 30 and December 31 of each year
                            would be compared either with the September 1955 average or the six
                            month average of any subsequent period on which an exchange rate
                            revision had been based, whichever were later. The 25 percent cutoff
                            would be used for such comparisons.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that there would be no publicity until action is
                            formalized.</p>

                        <p>Deputy Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> opened the meeting by pointing out the fact
                            that the United States Government is spending about one and one-quarter
                            billion dollars a year in Korea. In connection with the desire of the
                            Department of Defense to reduce the volume of this expenditure, the
                            Department of Defense has been anxious to place the most modern weapons
                            in Korea. It is hoped that in the long run this will make it possible to
                            reduce the size of the Korean military forces, thereby enabling the
                            reduction of United States expenditures. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> made the additional point that the type of
                            weapons which had been under discussion between the two departments in
                            connection with Korea is furnished to all United States forces, both
                            inside and outside the United States, except the two divisions in
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Radford</persName> followed with a
                            statement that the Communists have repeatedly violated the terms of the
                            Armistice Agreement, and by such action had thrown the comparative
                            effectiveness of the forces in north and south Korea out of balance. To
                            correct this situation. Admiral <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Radford</persName> indicated that it was necessary to introduce for
                            the use of United States military personnel in Korea modern weapons such
                            as the Nike, the Honest <persName>John</persName>, 280 mm. guns and the
                            Corporal and Redstone missiles.</p>
                        <p>Department of State representatives, particularly Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PH1">Phleger</persName>, agreed that the north Koreans
                            have violated the Armistice. However, the evidence which is convincing
                            to the Departments of State and Defense is not in a form which can be
                            used to convince the Swiss and Swedes, who are members of the Neutral
                            Nations Supervisory Commission, the fifteen countries who sent troops to
                            Korea during the hostilities in addition to the United States, and the
                            United Nations generally.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> expressed the
                            concern that the United States would be in a most undesirable position
                            if the United States did in fact lay itself open to criticism by our
                            Allies and the neutral nations <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0417"
                            />without fully preparing the groundwork through discussions with such
                            countries. He proposed that it would appear to be desirable to ask some
                            country to make a statement in the United Nations or some other forum
                            pointing out the grossness of the violation of the Armistice by the
                            Communists.</p>
                        <p>It was agreed that the Department of Defense would, on a top priority
                            basis, pull together all available evidence of Communist violation of
                            the Armistice in a form which could be used in discussing the matter
                            with the Swiss and Swedes, the fifteen nations and the United Nations.
                            When the Department of Defense has pulled this information together,
                            representatives of the Departments of State and Defense will join to put
                            the material in a form which is considered to be convincing to the
                            countries in question.</p>

                        <p>On January 31, 1957, the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> is scheduled
                            to consider the paper in which the Planning Board has set forth the
                            psychological, political, military, and economic evaluation of four
                            alternative force levels for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            military establishment. This Planning Board paper is attached (Tab

                        <p>I have studied the alternatives most carefully. Since my recent visit to
                            Korea, I am even more firmly convinced than in my memorandum of November
                            20, 1956, to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_HHJ1">Hoover</persName> (Tab

                                printed as <ref target="#d185">Document 185</ref>.</note> that it
                            would be a serious mistake to sanction any weakening of the present
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> defensive strength so long as
                            the Communist capabilities and intentions in the area remain unchanged.
                            The situation in Korea is now one of armed truce with the Communist side
                            continually augmenting, in violation of the Armistice Agreement, its
                            military capabilities in north Korea through the introduction of a
                            formidable jet air force, modern armor and artillery greater in quantity
                            and fire power than existed in 1953. Were we to bring about a cut in
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military strength now, or in the
                            absence of any change in the Communist position in the future, we would
                            in my opinion, be clearly repeating the mistakes of 1948–1950. At the
                            very least, such a move would <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0419"
                            />strengthen Communist determination to obstruct a Korean political
                            settlement on other than Communist terms, i.e., the extension of
                            Communist domination over all Korea.</p>
                        <p><gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss> is not satisfied generally with the
                            discussion of the alternatives in the Planning Board paper. The [<hi

                            of November, 1956,<note n="4" xml:id="d200fn4">See <ref target="#d177"
                                    >Document 177</ref>.</note> on which much of the Planning Board
                            paper is based, was objected to by State as inadequate. As a result it
                            carries a footnote which reads “The present estimate does not consider
                            possible repercussions of the assumed U.S. action outside south Korea
                            nor does it consider longer run consequences of U.S. action within south
                            Korea.” This largely invalidates the estimate.</p>
                        <p>The paper presented by the Planning Board demonstrates, in my opinion,
                            the unacceptability of alternatives B, C, and D; each of which involve
                            cuts in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels. In the face of
                            a continued aggressive posture by the Communists a cut in forces would
                            be considered a step toward heavier cuts, thus undermining the U.S.
                            position and the resolve to restrain Communist aggression not only in
                            Korea but the entire Far East. Alternatives B and D provide for the
                            introduction of new [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text
                                not declassified</hi>]. In the absence of a demonstrable case that
                            the Communists have violated the Armistice in a like manner, the
                            introduction of these weapons would excite protests from many of our
                            Allies as well as neutrals on the grounds that the U.S. had violated the
                            Armistice.</p>
                        <p>I am not contending that the size of the Korean armed forces, and the
                            ratio among the individual <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> services
                            should remain a fixed matter indefinitely. The Agreed Minute of
                            Understanding of 1954 provides for a phased reduction of active forces
                            as reserve divisions are created. Such a reduction, if and when made,
                            must take full account of the security situation not only in Korea but
                            also in the Far East generally. I believe many of our agencies are
                            working on this problem under the misapprehension that the security
                            situation in Korea has eased because of the withdrawal of some of the
                            Chinese Communist forces, which after all can easily re-enter from
                            Manchuria in massive strength with no warning. The security situation
                            has, in fact, worsened as a result of increases in Communist aircraft
                            and firepower.</p>

                            Staff felt that we must not only be ready for a possible aggression
                            against the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> from the north, but that
                            we must also be prepared to deal with the possibility of internal
                            disturbances in the Republic of Korea. In the light of these
                            considerations, <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName>
                            believed that a reduction beyond certain limits of the force levels in
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would endanger South Korea. As
                            the result of a considerable build-up in the North Korean armed forces,
                            there was a definite shift in the power balance to the advantage of
                            North Korea. This power shift had not yet reached a significant point,
                            but the direction was plain. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral
                                Burke</persName> noted that of course the North Koreans were
                            violating the provisions of the Armistice, while we in turn were
                            observing the Armistice. If we undertook to violate the Armistice, we
                            could introduce into South Korea new and greatly improved weapons which
                            would enable us to reduce over-all force levels.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> then reminded the
                            Council that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was a
                            very old man, who was engaged in running a “one-man democracy” at the
                            present time. There was very likely to be chaos when <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> died, and the Communists might at
                            this juncture make a try for full control of Korea. Thus, since we feel
                            that our forces in Korea must be ready for any contingency, the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff are of the opinion that Alternative B of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702 constitutes the most prudent
                            program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> asked <persName
                                corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> if he would explain
                            briefly to the members of the Council the nature of the “dual nuclear
                            conventional capability” which is to become “standard” in the armed
                            forces of the United States in the future. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1"
                                >Admiral Burke</persName> replied that this term was to be defined
                            as covering such weapons as “Honest John” rockets, 8-inch Howitzers, and
                            missiles [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>
                            commented that this was the essence of our problem.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> put the question
                            as to whether the Council was now going to make a definite decision as
                            to which alternative to choose, or whether the Council was merely
                            engaging in a discussion, after which things would wait for a while
                            before a final decision was made. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> stated that he had a position with respect to a
                            desirable military program for Korea which was essentially his own and
                            which differed in some respects from the position of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff. He said, however, that he did agree with the proposal of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff to reduce the number of active <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions from 20 to 16. He would not,
                            however, go so far as to reduce the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            active divisions to 10. Such a move would be too sudden and would
                            involve too great a dislocation.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> went on to state
                            his opinion that war was not going to start up again in Korea or places
                            like that, because there <pb n="394" xml:id="pg_394" facs="0422"/>would
                            be insufficient advantage to the Communists in merely acquiring Korea at
                            such a cost. He believed that we should certainly “get loose” from
                            Korean-like situations, both in Korea and elsewhere in the world, in
                            order that we might concentrate our resources and capabilities on more
                            vital areas. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            continued with a statement that the introduction of our new weapons did
                            involve a very serious psychological problem. He believed that it would
                            be wisest to keep these new weapons for the time being in [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                            declassified</hi>], since there would be more loss than gain for us if
                            we should put these new weapons into Korea itself. While such problems
                            were largely in the field of the Secretary of State, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said he felt that he wished to
                            give his own view for what it might be worth. At any rate, he concluded,
                            he would begin to untangle the United States from its present situation
                            vis-à-vis such areas as Korea. British and Commonwealth troops were all
                            shortly to get out of Korea, and the United States would, of course, be
                            left holding the bag.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> speak next,
                            pointing out in so doing that Alternatives B and C were the likely ones
                            that the United States would adopt if we should reach a decision to
                            change our present program (Alternative A).</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> commenced his
                            statement by pointing out that the choice of a military program in Korea
                            involved two major problems. First, the matter of the internal situation
                            within Korea, and secondly, the matter of our compliance with the terms
                            of the Armistice, which involved our world position. He then went on to
                            say that of course the real deterrent to a renewed Communist attack on
                            South Korea was the nuclear power which the United States had [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than I line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            and our ability to use this power to destroy the bulk of Chinese
                            Communist industry. Nevertheless, the situation in the Republic of Korea
                            itself is such that the area could be lost through subversion rather
                            than through external aggression if the United States were to take
                            action which appeared to indicate that we were abandoning South Korea.
                            The South Koreans, like many other nations in a similar situation, want
                            visible evidence of military strength on site, even though we may feel
                            that they should rely on our capacity for retaliation. To the South
                            Koreans, our capability for massive retaliation is not immediately
                            visible and always remains to some degree uncertain. It is the
                            prevalence of such a point of view in large parts of the world which is
                            causing us so much trouble with our military aid programs. In any event,
                            a considerable reduction of visible military strength in South Korea
                            would have very serious internal repercussions. The course of action
                            which would provide the greatest reassurance to the South Koreans would
                            doubtless be the introduction of atomic weaponry, even though such a
                            move might be <pb n="395" xml:id="pg_395" facs="0423"/>largely symbolic.
                            If we followed such a course of action, the South Koreans might agree to
                            the reduction of the levels of their own forces.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, this course of action would mark a departure
                            from the terms of the Armistice; that is, if we were to put such weapons
                            in Korea as are not there now— for example, Honest Johns. <persName
                                corresp="#p_YCYD1">You</persName> could put in all the 8-inch
                            Howitzers you wanted to, because they are already there, but the
                            introduction of other new weapons would certainly be the occasion for a
                            greatly stepped-up Communist propaganda campaign. More serious (since
                            the Communist propaganda campaign was already on) would be the
                            interpretation given to such a course of action by the neutral nations
                            and by some of our allies, who would consider it an unjustified
                            violation of the Armistice terms by the United States. Apropos of this
                            point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> alluded
                            to a recent conversation with Duncan Sandys, the British Defense
                            Minister. In a kind of a way, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> pointed out, the British face a problem in
                            Germany not unlike the problem we face in Korea. For this reason,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had thought that
                            Sandys and British officials generally would be sympathetic to a
                            proposal for the introduction of new weapons. Nevertheless, Sandys felt
                            that to do this would constitute so extreme a violation of the Armistice
                            terms as to make him personally doubt the wisdom of the proposal and to
                            question whether the United Kingdom would be likely to support this
                            course of action. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> added that Sandys had not categorically refused
                            support for such a proposal, but had given him reason to doubt that such
                            support would be forthcoming. While, said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, there wasn’t the slightest
                            doubt that the Communists have consistently violated the Armistice
                            agreement, the evidence of violation is of such a character that the
                            United States would find it difficult to make use of a great deal of
                            this evidence. Accordingly, we might not be able to satisfy world
                            opinion as to the scale of Communist violation of the Korean Armistice.
                            While the United States would certainly not want to treat the Korean
                            Armistice as wholly void, it might be possible to separate out paragraph
                            13–d and void its provisions.</p>
                        <p>In summary, concluded Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, from the standpoint of our <hi rend="italic"
                                >Foreign Relations,</hi> avoiding the introduction of these new
                            types of weapons while at the same time securing a reduction in the
                            level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, would obviously be
                            the best solution. However, if the United States felt that it could not
                            afford this course of action, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> indicated that he would choose to take the risks
                            involved in a violation of the Armistice agreement rather than to elect
                            a course of action which drastically reduced the levels of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> commented that a
                            shift of four <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions from an
                            active to a reserve status would probably improve the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            <pb n="396" xml:id="pg_396" facs="0424"/>internal situation a little bit
                            and, accordingly, save the United States a little money, but certainly
                            not very much. It was, of course, possible that if the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels were reduced, the North
                            Koreans would respond by reducing their forces. Perhaps the best thing
                            was to start this reduction in a gradual way, so that the least protest
                            would be aroused in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated that he was extremely weary of the blackmail
                            which seemed constantly to be practiced against the United States, but
                            that he had a couple of questions that he wished now to put before the
                            Council. He said he believed that all of us agreed that the danger of
                            war does not arise from the intrinsic value to the Communists of the
                            Korean peninsula, but rather derives from the prestige which the
                            Communists would enjoy if they succeeded in destroying a nation (South
                            Korea) set up and maintained by the United States. In short, South Korea
                            had become a symbol throughout the world. Of course, if the South
                            Koreans state that they wish to go Communist and do so, the practical
                            harm to the United States would not amount to very much. Accordingly,
                            the President said, he was not greatly worried about the internal
                            situation in South Korea, but more concerned with what was necessary to
                            deter an attack from North Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> observed that the
                            pattern we face in Korea was also the pattern we faced in Formosa. The
                            great danger seemed to be that unless we continued to pay the blackmail
                            costs, the situation in Formosa might go to pot, especially if South
                            Korea fell to the Communists first. There would be obvious repercussions
                            in Japan likewise.</p>
                        <p>On the subject of blackmail, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> commented that the next time we pay it he would
                            like to be sure for once that we got something in return.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> stated that he believed
                            the Council should try to look upon the present paper as illustrating
                            ways and means of making savings in U.S. resources not only in Korea but
                            elsewhere in the world. In these difficult areas the Council had already
                            acted on Pakistan. Next week Iran would be before the Council for
                            consideration. It was essential, however, not to overlook the injunction
                            which the Council had given to the Planning Board to try to find, if
                            possible or feasible, means to discover ways of saving U.S. resources.
                            It appeared to Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> was prepared to
                            go along with a reduction of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            active forces by four divisions. We should remember, however, that in
                            this alternative (Alternative B) some of the savings which would result
                            from the reduction in the number of active <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions would be reduced by the added costs arising
                            from the introduction of additional jet aircraft. After citing the
                            relevant financial figures, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> speculated as to whether Alternative <pb n="397"
                                xml:id="pg_397" facs="0425"/>B would be acceptable to the South
                            Koreans if jet aircraft were given to them instead of the new weapons
                            for which they had been clamoring.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> said he doubted
                            whether this substitution would be acceptable to the South Koreans,
                            because what they really wanted was visible evidence of their ability to
                            meet an attack. <persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName>
                            agreed that there was no significant danger of an attack from North
                            Korea at the present time; but if the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s came to feel that their military strength was going to
                            be significantly reduced in the near future, it would be all the harder
                            to get them to accept any further reductions later on.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> felt that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> had raised two
                            important points to which the Council should give careful thought. In
                            the first place, there was the question as to whether the Council was
                            proposing to make a decision today, or whether the current discussion on
                            military programs in Korea was exploratory in character and that no
                            decision on a military program in Korea would be made until the Council
                            was also ready to reach some decisions with respect to suitable military
                            programs for other areas than Korea. It was Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>’s view that the Council must
                            face up to the general problem of our military aid programs rather than
                            to deal seriatim with individual countries. In any case, the Council
                            must clearly realize that the United States cannot go on for another ten
                            years, as it had for the past ten years, spending our resources on
                            military aid programs currently in effect. Such a course would be
                            suicidal for the United States. Accordingly, if we are going to change
                            to a real “new look policy” for the world as a whole, the sooner we
                            decided to do so, the better. Accordingly, he would recommend that the
                            Council fit Korea into a general program which would notably reduce the
                            size and expenditures for our military assistance programs world-wide.
                            In other words, we must look this problem full in the face. The United
                            States was rapidly being left with the task of defending the whole free
                            world. We must decide, therefore, what kind of a defense of the free
                            world we are prepared to make on the assumption that we alone must bear
                            the costs. In Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                            >Humphrey</persName>’s opinion, the answer was clear, and that we should
                            depend on our massive retaliatory capability. Reliance on this
                            capability was in his opinion the sole feasible means by which the
                            United States could get itself in a position of being able to defend the
                            free world. It was perfectly clear that the United Kingdom and France
                            were not going to be able to give us significant help. So we must go it
                            alone, and in so doing concentrate our resources on maintaining our
                            retaliatory power rather than dissipating our strength in small amounts
                            all over the world. Such dissipation of our powers might very well lose
                            us our massive retaliatory capacity. In summary, therefore, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he would <pb
                                n="398" xml:id="pg_398" facs="0426"/>recommend that the Council
                            pigeonhole this agenda item until we could reach a decision involving
                            the whole world as to how we should defend ourselves. After making the
                            general decision, we could deal with the individual cases.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                            Council and the Planning Board had been trying to approach the general
                            problem outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> by analyzing the situation in each of the
                            so-called <persName corresp="#p_PHV1">Prochnow</persName>
                                countries.<note n="8" xml:id="d201fn8">Korea, Turkey, Iran,
                                Pakistan, Vietnam, and the Republic of China.</note> He went on to
                            say that the Planning Board (and he subsequently changed “Planning
                            Board” to “I” as more accurate) thought that if the Secretary of State
                            could bring himself to swallow the pill of a significant U.S. violation
                            of the Korean Armistice, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had put up a
                            relatively attractive package in Alternative B. Moreover, adoption of
                            Alternative B at this time might lead to reductions over and above the
                            four divisions contemplated in Alternative B as proposed by the Joint
                            Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName><note n="9"
                                xml:id="d201fn9"><persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Percival F.
                                    Brundage</persName>, Director of the Bureau of the
                                Budget.</note> said that he had a significant point to make. As he
                            understood it, Alternative B was a two-year program, while Alternatives
                            C and D were spaced over a period of three years. Would it not be
                            possible for the Council to decide to start with Alternative B and move
                            later to Alternative C and still further reductions? In Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName>’s opinion the savings to be
                            achieved by the adoption of Alternative B were not significant enough in
                            themselves to be the stopping point in the reduction process.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the savings which might flow from the adoption of
                            Alternative B, Dr. <persName>Flemming</persName> inquired whether it was
                            proposed to devote the savings from the reduction in the military
                            program to increasing the economic assistance which the United States
                            would give to South Korea. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> replied that no increase in the level of economic
                            aid was being proposed, because we had been informed that for a period
                            at least the South Korean economy could not absorb additional economic
                            aid. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> also
                            registered strong opposition to any proposal to increase our economic
                            assistance to South Korea by the way of any savings from a reduction in
                            our military assistance program. [<hi rend="italic">2-1/2 lines of

                        <p>Contrary to the proposals of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName>, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> expressed the hope that the Council could make
                            some progress toward a solution of the South Korean situation without
                            waiting to deal with the over-all situation with respect to our military
                            assistance programs. He pointed out that four years ago basically we had
                            agreed that our massive retaliatory capability was going to be the chief
                            deterrent to war. Accordingly, our trouble is not, as Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> suggested, any lack
                            of a basic policy, but perhaps <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0427"
                            />stemmed from the fact that we have not applied our basic policy in the
                            necessary way. In any event, we could not successfully deal with our
                            situation if we suddenly and drastically reduced all our military
                            assistance programs world-wide as the Secretary of the Treasury had
                            suggested. Instead, we should deal with each country in terms of its
                            merits and the peculiarities of its individual situation. It would be
                            much too great a shock to make a world-wide decision to reduce and then
                            proceed promptly to carry it out. We must deal certainly with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> situation in terms of a gradual rather
                            than a sudden reduction for, after all, we are not sure that even the
                            modest reduction set forth in Alternative B will not be too much of a
                            shock for the South Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> replied that
                            the point that he was really making is that a mere $65 million annually,
                            which was the amount we could anticipate if Alternative B were adopted,
                            was no great shakes. While he did not advocate drastic reductions all at
                            once, he did believe that we should know where we were going ultimately
                            before we started down any path.</p>
                        <p>The President indicated his sympathy with the position on this issue
                            taken by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and his
                            belief that it was essential to apply a general principle to each
                            particular country. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> replied that he was not advocating the
                            application of reductions all at once and all over the world. He did
                            believe, however, that the National Security Council should agree on a
                            generally reduced program of military assistance world-wide, and
                            gradually apply this general program to one country after another until
                            our objective of a general reduction in costs has been achieved.</p>
                        <p>In response to this proposal, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> commented briefly on the very great difficulty we
                            would face in selling our friends and our allies on the point of sole
                            reliance on the retaliatory capability of the United States in their
                            defense against Communism. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> repeated that he was not recommending that we
                            now take action on a general reduction of our military assistance
                            program, but that we agree on a plan of action; and certainly any plan
                            which results in saving this country only $65 million a year is pretty
                            nearly worthless. The savings must be a great deal larger, both in Korea
                            and everywhere else in the world.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> explained to the
                            Council the difficulties which could be anticipated if we proposed a
                            very sudden reduction in the force levels for Korea. He said he knew
                            this by his own bitter experience. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> still insisted that, at the very best,
                            Alternative B represented a timid beginning in reducing the drain on
                            U.S. resources.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_BAAA1">Admiral Burke</persName> took the position
                            that if we adopted Alternative B we might succeed in convincing the
                            South Koreans that the United <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0428"
                            />States had the military power on hand in South Korea to defend them
                            and accordingly Alternative B might be the first step in a series of
                            further reductions. He warned, however, lest we follow a course of
                            action which might cause the South Koreans to lose confidence in our
                            willingness and ability to defend them.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> argued that,
                            after all, the United States had a few rights in the world and it was
                            high time that we gave some thought to our own rights and interests.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> immediately
                            pointed out that we were not defending countries like South Korea out of
                            any particular affection for them, but because it was in the national
                            interest of the United States to defend them. He repeated that we could
                            not deprive these countries of all the visible on-site signs of their
                            capability to defend themselves. However, if we have got to risk a
                            course of action which will involve some kind of real shock to the
                            world, he would rather endure the shock as a result of the introduction
                            of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] into Korea than by drastically reducing <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said he believed this all the
                            more valid inasmuch as reliance on [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>] will have to become the
                            long-term policy and program of the United States. It was not improbable
                            that we could persuade at least some of our allies to accept this
                            proposition. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            commented that this was certainly the kind of program he felt the United
                            States should embark on, but in any case let us not stop at a reduction
                            of only four divisions in the active forces of the Republic of
                            Korea.</p>
                        <p>At this point in the discussion the Secretary of State rose from the
                            table and said that he was obliged to leave the meeting in order to keep
                            an appointment with King Saud.<note n="10" xml:id="d201fn10">King Saud
                                of Saudi Arabia arrived in Washington on January 29 for a State
                                visit.</note> Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then
                            quickly called attention to the need for Council discussion on the next
                            item of the agenda, namely, the Indian request for withdrawal of funds
                            from the International Monetary Fund, and invited the Secretary of the
                            Treasury to make his report while Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> could still hear it. (Discussion of the Indian
                            request will be found under Item 2 of this memorandum.)</p>
                        <p>Resuming discussion of the Korean alternatives, the President observed
                            that behind all the remarks that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> had made relative to the costs of our military
                            assistance programs and also the use that India was likely to make of
                            funds withdrawn from the International Monetary Fund, lay our estimate
                            of how acute was our difficulty in trying to keep the free world free.
                            Accordingly, the level of our military and other assistance to free
                            nations was not merely a matter of how much the United States could
                            afford to provide <pb n="401" xml:id="pg_401" facs="0429"/>these nations
                            by way of assistance. If we lose important areas of the free world to
                            Communism the repercussions on ourselves would be very grave.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his
                            views on the very serious financial situation that the United States
                            might soon face. We are now somewhat concerned with inflation, but
                            things could change very abruptly, and we may soon be worrying about
                            deflation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            insisted that he could see certain signs indicating the deflationary
                            process already, and he warned that things could shift very quickly if
                            the people of the United States lost confidence in their government. To
                            this, the President said that we would have to decide which we were most
                            frightened of at the present time—international Communism or our own
                            internal situation. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> answered that in point of fact for the last
                            four years we have been wrestling with the attempt to find the correct
                            balance between these two dangers. The President said that he certainly
                            agreed that we could not approach this problem from any one single point
                            of view. Our only course was to seek the correct balance between our
                            internal demands and the demands of our military defense. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> warned that in his
                            opinion we could not take much more out of our economy than we are
                            taking now. Indeed, he felt we could not afford to support our present
                            military programs at their present levels. We have simply got to find
                            some way of getting more defense for fewer dollars.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that he
                            strongly supported the gradual approach to the reduction in our military
                            assistance programs and, as a matter of fact, he for one was not
                            prepared to sneer at a $65 million annual savings. The President
                            interrupted to say that he was a little astonished to find Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> speaking of $65
                            million in such an offhand fashion. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> went on to say that he was much
                            troubled at what the country was going to face in defense costs in
                            Fiscal Year 1959. He counseled that we go carefully bit by bit.</p>
                        <p>In order, said Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, that the
                            Council should not lose momentum on the solution of these problems, he
                            would suggest that the Planning Board now be directed by the Council to
                            prepare a revised policy on South Korea, the military portion of which
                            would be based on Alternative B but which would include plans and
                            suggestions for a possible further reduction in the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active divisions from four in the
                            direction of ten. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName> agreed that it would be wise to adopt Alternative
                            B, while at the same time exploring the possibilities of further
                            reductions. He could certainly go along with this recommendation of the
                            Joint Chiefs of Staff if the Secretary of State were not too worried
                            about this course of action; but he believed that we should not talk to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> about reducing the
                                <pb n="402" xml:id="pg_402" facs="0430"/>active divisions of the
                            South Korean army from 20 to 10. The President merely commented that
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> must be an idiot to want
                            to support 20 active divisions. He simply was unable to understand
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s reasoning. The Vice
                            President commented that the $65 million annual saving was in a way more
                            significant than the mere dollars would indicate, because it might pave
                            the way for other and greater savings, both in Korea and elsewhere in
                            the world. Its real significance was in the establishment of a pattern
                            of reductions and savings.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said he wanted
                            a footnote to be added to indicate that he certainly did not disdain $65
                            million (laughter).</p>

                            the Planning Board meeting this afternoon. While the revision certainly
                            improves upon the first draft, it does not succeed entirely in meeting
                            the various points which we believe must be taken into account in
                            setting forth a revised policy statement on Korea based upon the
                            adoption of Alternative B.<note n="3" xml:id="d202fn3">See <ref

                            assumption that further changes will be made in the paper as a result of
                            its consideration today by the Planning Board, I should like to suggest
                            that representatives of <gloss target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>, <gloss
                                target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> and L meet with a representative of
                                <gloss target="#t_SP1">S/P</gloss> early next week to discuss the

                        <p>Since it is understood that the purpose of this paper is to explore the
                            effects of the adoption of Alternative B rather than to carry out a
                            decision already made, it seems to <gloss target="#t_IO1">IO</gloss> the
                            paper should deal with the possible repercussions of the adoption of
                            Alternative B upon other aspects of the Korean problem. For example,
                            would our allies in the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> regard
                            themselves as still bound by the Joint Policy Declaration? Would our
                            departure from the letter of the Armistice Agreement build up pressures
                            that already exist for a settlement in Korea to an extent that might
                            bring about a renewal of negotiations on unification under terms
                            currently unacceptable to the U.S.? Is the U.S. prepared to meet
                            proposals for adjudication of the legal question whether the action
                            contemplated in Alternative B can be reconciled with the terms of the
                            Armistice Agreement? What will be the effect <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404"

                            and Security Council where, as in the Middle East, we may wish to insist

                            some of the questions which must be answered before we can approach the
                            next series of questions which would relate to timing, tactics and
                            methods of presentation.</p>

                                            with its political and territorial integrity assured by
                                            international agreement and with.” A majority of the
                                            Planning Board Assistants felt that the paragraph should
                                            conclude with the following language: “armed forces
                                            sufficient for internal security and capable of strong
                                            resistance in event of attack by a foreign power.” The
                                            representatives of the Bureau of the Budget and the
                                            Department of the Treasury proposed concluding language
                                            which would permit a greater reduction in American aid:
                                            “sufficient strength for internal security and limited
                                            initial resistance in event of attack by a foreign
                                            power.”</note> which sets forth our long-range objective
                                        in Korea. Their desire to substitute “limited initial” for
                                        “strong” resistance here and in paragraph 24c<note n="4"

                                            of the February 28 draft indicated that, in order to
                                            achieve a unified, democratic, independent, and friendly
                                            Korea, the United States should be prepared, inter alia,
                                            to “accept a level of Korean armed forces sufficient for
                                            internal security and capable of strong resistance in

                                        forces strikes at the very heart of our objectives and
                                        intentions in Korea and, in fact, in the entire Far East
                                        area.</p>
                                    <p>In Korea, at tremendous expense and effort, we have created
                                        the largest, most effective and most reliable military force
                                        in the Far East. <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0433"
                                        />This force serves and will serve not only as a positive
                                        deterrent to a renewal of Communist aggression in Korea but
                                        at the same time ties up large Communist forces in north
                                        Korea and Communist China, which otherwise would be free for
                                        deployment and possible aggression elsewhere.</p>
                                    <p>The will to resist Communism is stronger in Korea by far than
                                        in any other Far Eastern country. This will to resist
                                        depends largely on the confidence of the Korean people in
                                        the ability of their own armed forces successfully to hold
                                        renewed Communist aggression in check until outside
                                        assistance on their behalf can be brought to bear.
                                        Understandably, such resistance must be capable of
                                        preventing the Korean peninsula from being overrun as was
                                        the case in 1950. It is my understanding that our own
                                        military planning is also based on the maintenance of
                                        sufficient <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                                        strength to prevent the loss of the peninsula until our own
                                        retaliatory measures can be brought to bear against the
                                        aggressor.</p>
                                    <p>I consider it extremely important, therefore, that the
                                        present language in paragraphs 1 and 24c be retained and
                                        that State vigorously support the majority view on this
                                        point at today’s Planning Board meeting.</p></item>

                                <item>I also feel we should support the majority in the split with
                                    Defense on paragraph 15b.<note n="5" xml:id="d203fn5">The
                                        majority version of paragraph 15b called for the United

                                        and technical aid programs, to “continue to provide support
                                        for its military force.” The Department of Defense version
                                        of the same paragraph looked for the Republic of Korea to
                                        “assume an increasingly greater proportion of the cost of
                                        supporting its armed forces.”</note>

                                        in Korea. Paragraph 23e contemplated the open dissociation

                                should continue to observe and support the Korean Armistice
                                Agreement. To that end, the Department of State proposed
                                implementing language in paragraphs 19a and 19b which the Department
                                of Defense wanted to have deleted. In paragraph 19a, the bracketed
                                sentence reads: “Seek, as a matter of priority, to establish through
                                adequate evidence, the nature and scope of any violations of the

                                to Article 13(d).” In paragraph 19b, the bracketed sentence read:
                                “The timing of the introduction of dual conventional-nuclear weapons
                                under paragraph 9a shall be decided upon by the Secretaries of State

                            for the introduction of such weapons on the specific assurance that
                            publishable evidence was at hand confirming comparable Communist action
                            in north Korea. Thus far, the Department has not been provided with the

                            are convinced that, particularly in view of the clear provisions of the
                            Korean Armistice Agreement, it would be disastrous to our position with
                            our Allies and in the United Nations were we to proceed and equip our
                            forces in Korea with [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text

                            therefore, endeavored to build into the new Korean policy paper, which,
                            at National Security Council direction embodies Alternative B of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702, what we consider essential
                            safeguards in the implementation of Alternative B by giving due
                            consideration to the timing of such action and the bearing it will have
                            on other sectors, not only of our Korean policy but of our policy
                            towards our Allies and in the United Nations. I understand that during
                            Planning Board and Board Assistants consideration of the paper, these
                            safeguards were vigorously attacked and that the majority view at the
                            last Board Assistants meeting, with State strongly dissenting, was that
                            the National Security Council in selecting Alternative B of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702 had decided without conditions in
                            favor of giving our forces dual conventional nuclear weapons, thus
                            permitting a reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces,
                            and that our policy should, therefore, be directed toward the immediate
                            implementation of that decision.</p>
                        <p>I believe you will agree that since the Secretary’s concurrence in
                            Alternative B was based on <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral

                            Communist actions, we must, in the absence of such evidence, require
                            adequate safeguards in the new policy paper. I do not think, therefore,
                            that State can agree at this juncture to a paper which excludes in
                            substance the bracketed portions of paragraphs 9(a), 11, and 19 of the
                            March 13 draft.</p>

                                should be “capable of strong resistance in event of attack by a
                                foreign power.” The word “strong” was bracketed in the draft,
                                indicating a divergence of opinion among the Planning Board
                                Assistants. The word “strong” was similarly bracketed and indicated
                                as a Department of State proposal in paragraph 24c, which reads
                                that, in order to promote Korean unification, the United States
                                should: “accept a level of Korean armed forces sufficient for
                                internal security and capable of [strong] resistance in event of

                            warrant such action by the U.S.” This paragraph sets up no standard to
                            guide the determination (such as “comparable in nature and extent”), but
                            I understand the underlying intention of State to relate to Communist
                            violations (subsequent to the withdrawal of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1"
                                >NNSC</gloss> into the demilitarized zone) of such a nature as to
                            require the U.S. to take such action as it feasibly can to “redress the
                            balance.”</p>
                        <p>In this ardent discussion, it was stated that Defense–<gloss
                                target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> had promised to supply to State
                            information relative to all Communist armistice violations but that such
                            information had not yet been furnished. I think that this information
                            should be promptly furnished and discussed between Secretaries <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, in order that the Council Meeting can proceed on
                            the basis of such discussion (and agreement, if any) having
                            occurred.</p>
                        <p>The Korea paper is scheduled on the Council agenda for April 4. It is
                            urgent, therefore, that the above mentioned information be furnished and
                            discussed by the two Secretaries before the paper is presented to the
                            Council. Otherwise, we shall possibly be wasting the President’s time.
                            I, therefore, want you, Farrell,<note n="4" xml:id="d206fn4">General

                        <p>Turning to the splits in paragraph 9–a of the March 13 draft, the Bureau
                            of the Budget graciously agreed to eliminate its double-starred
                            proposal. The Budget’s alternative proposal had been that the U.S.
                            should <hi rend="italic">now</hi> introduce as many [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] as the
                            armistice would permit and <hi rend="italic">later</hi>—when publishable
                            evidence was at hand—proceed to introduce the balance of the [<hi

                            declassified</hi>]. It was felt that this proposal would fuzz-up the
                            very clear and serious split in the paper and might seem to permit under
                            its first clause going ahead with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> reduction in active divisions and jet plane
                            substitution (contrary to the package deal). I understand that State and
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> will present a list for use by
                            me at the <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> meeting of those [<hi

                            which under a liberal interpretation of the armistice can now be
                            introduced without awaiting a determination as to publishable evidence
                                <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0440"/>and those [<hi

                        <p>Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> came to the Department to deliver a
                            diplomatic note informing the United States Government of the decision
                            by the United Kingdom to withdraw its forces from the United Nations
                            Command in Korea, except for a small liaison group, by October 1957. A
                            copy of this note is attached.<note n="2" xml:id="d208fn2">Not
                                printed.</note> Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> pointed out that
                            the Foreign Office had asked the Embassy to call particular attention to
                            the fact that this decision was taken purely for economic reasons and is
                            to be interpreted in no way as a diminution of United Kingdom support
                            for the Republic of Korea or the objectives of the United Nations in
                            working for a united, independent and democratic Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> added that Canada, Australia and New
                            Zealand had been informed of the decision. He did not know whether these
                            three countries would follow the lead of the United Kingdom and remove
                            their forces. He pointed out, however, that the forces of the three
                            countries are so intimately tied in with the United Kingdom forces, it
                            is doubtful that they can remain without the United Kingdom forces.<note

                                were conveyed to the Department by the New Zealand Embassy on April
                                3, by the Australian Embassy on April 5, and by the Canadian Embassy
                                on April 26. An April 3 memorandum by <persName corresp="#p_PHL1"

                                April 26, regarding the Australian and Canadian decisions
                                respectively, are <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> 795.00.</note></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Sebald</persName> stated that what disturbs the United
                            States with respect to this decision is that it could have a chain
                            reaction and have repercussions on the entire United Nations operation
                            in Korea. We are indeed sorry to see the United Kingdom unit pull
                            out.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> alluded to the fact that the United
                            Kingdom is reviewing its operations and its military strength for the
                            entire area. In connection with this review, it had been pointed out
                            that the troops which they have maintained in Korea are the most
                            expensive, on a per capita basis, which the United Kingdom has in any
                            part of the world.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName> concluded the conversation by
                            referring to the fact that the Republic of Korea has been urging the
                            United Kingdom for some time to raise its Legation in Seoul to the
                            status of an Embassy. The decision has now been made by the United
                            Kingdom to exchange ambassadors with the Republic of Korea, if that is
                            still the wish of the Koreans. Mr. <persName>de la Mare</persName>
                            explained that the Korean Government will be informed of this decision
                            at the same time the United Kingdom Chargé in Seoul passes on the
                            information about the withdrawal of forces. It is the hope of the United
                            Kingdom that <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0443"/>this action will
                            decrease the possible dissatisfaction by the Republic of Korea with the
                            decision to reduce their forces.</p>

                            abandonment of 22 million people. We have in mind, of course, a
                            situation comparable to the Hungarian revolt wherein the <gloss

                            5702/1, emphasizing the differing views of the Departments of State and
                            Defense with respect to the introduction of certain dual
                            conventional-nuclear weapons in connection with the modernization of
                            U.S. forces in Korea. He pointed out that the difference in view was
                            most apparent in paragraph 19–b of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5702/1, reading as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            note is filed in the minutes of the meeting.)</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of his briefing, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> called on Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> stated that he had long been quite sympathetic to
                            the point of view of the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff with respect to modernizing the U.S. forces in Korea by the
                            introduction of new weapons, including some which had dual
                            conventional-nuclear capabilities. Indeed, he said, he had already gone
                            a long way toward meeting these views. Reluctantly, however, he had been
                            forced to conclude that he could not go all the way desired by the
                            military, because he believed that if we introduced the two disputed
                            items (280 mm guns and 762 mm rockets), the political disadvantages of
                            such a course of action would be greater, in his mind, than the military
                            advantages. (At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> distributed to the members of the Council a “List
                            of New Weapons for U.S. Forces in Korea”,<note n="7" xml:id="d212fn7"
                                >Presumably the list attached to <ref target="#d209">Document
                                    209</ref>.</note> copy of which is filed in the minutes of the
                            meeting.) Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> went
                            on to state that there was no doubt that the Communists had
                            substantially violated the terms of the Armistice in introducing new
                            weapons into North Korea. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> said he had gone over all of the available
                            evidence, both the classified evidence which, of course, could not be
                            publicly revealed, and the unclassified evidence, which could be. The
                            sum total of all this evidence did not, however, in Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>’ view, actually prove and
                            demonstrate violations of the Armistice by the Communists of the
                            magnitude which we in this country believe has actually occurred. He
                            repeated that he did not doubt that these violations had been on a very
                            large scale, even if the United States was not in a position to
                            demonstrate this fact to the world. On the other hand, continued
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, there was no
                            evidence of the Communist introduction of weapons with atomic
                            capabilities into North Korea, and he personally doubted that this had
                            happened, because he thought it very unlikely that the Soviets would
                            entrust atomic weapons to the Communist Chinese or to the North Korean
                            armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought it was
                            also germane that most of the evidence that we have of Communist
                            violations of the Armistice had been obtained prior to August 1956, when
                            the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission had been
                            curtailed. At the time that we succeeded in curtailing these <gloss
                                target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> activities, we had informed the
                            United Nations that this was the only alteration in the Armistice
                            Agreement that the United States was seeking, and that we <pb n="422"
                                xml:id="pg_422" facs="0450"/>proposed to adhere to all the remaining
                            portions of that Agreement. In sum, not only was the publishable
                            evidence of Communist violations rather meager, but also, in a sense,
                            the United States was estopped from making use of the evidence, since we
                            had informed the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> last August that we
                            sought no other changes in the Armistice terms beyond the change
                            relative to the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then pointed out
                            the feeling of the State Department that the introduction of the 280 mm
                            guns and the Honest John 762 mm rockets, [<hi rend="italic">less than 1
                                line of source text not declassified</hi>] would cause serious
                            repercussions around the world. Most of our friends and allies would
                            feel that the United States had violated its own solemn agreement to
                            observe the Armistice terms. Likewise, we should become a focal point
                            for a tremendous Soviet propaganda campaign. The effect on our friends
                            and allies would be considerable. In support of this thesis, Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> revealed that he had
                            last December mentioned to <persName corresp="#p_MH1"
                                >Macmillan</persName> that the United States was proposing to
                            modernize its forces in South Korea. The Prime Minister, whom Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> described as a pretty
                            hard-headed man, expressed himself as strongly in favor of the
                            modernization of U.S. forces, [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text
                                not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> also pointed out
                            the serious effect of such a course of action on the announced
                            willingness of the sixteen nations to join with us again to resist
                            aggression in Korea in case the Communists resumed hostilities.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> thought that
                            this was an important commitment on the part of the sixteen allied
                            nations in Korea, and that we should do everything we could to keep the
                            commitment alive. The proposed course of action also was certain to stir
                            up serious repercussions in Japan. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> therefore asked the question whether it was
                            really worthwhile to be regarded by our friends and allies as violators
                            of a solemn international agreement simply in order to get these two
                            particular weapons in the hands of our forces in Korea. After all, there
                            was a considerable list of other new weapons which would go far to
                            modernize U.S. forces in Korea despite the absence of the 280 mm gun and
                            the Honest John rocket. To add these last two items, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> repeated, would bring us to the
                            point where the situation was positively disadvantageous, [<hi
                                rend="italic">4 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. In this
                            contingency, <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> might well use
                            the violation of the Armistice Agreement as a pretext for launching his
                            much-desired march into North Korea. All these were the reasons which
                            explained the State Department position.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ remarks, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName> called on the Acting Secretary of Defense, but

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he
                            first wished to say that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had been very
                            concerned about the violations of the Armistice terms by the Communists
                            and the need for U.S. counter-measures, and had been pressing ever since
                            1954 for some sort of solution. Indeed, the matter had been discussed
                            several times with the representatives of the sixteen nations, and
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he
                            personally had made two presentations to these representatives. He had
                            come away on both occasions with a strong belief that the
                            representatives of the sixteen nations were absolutely content with the
                            status quo in Korea, and were in no way moved by his presentation of the
                            actualities. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            explained this attitude of satisfaction as a result of the fact that
                            there was no pressure on the military forces of these allied nations
                            because there were practically no forces left in Korea except those of
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> and of the United States. In any
                            event, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> doubted
                            very much that the sixteen-nation agreement mentioned earlier by
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> was of any great
                            military significance, though perhaps it had political value. He
                            reasoned here that if fighting were resumed by the Communists in Korea,
                            the United States would have to bear most of the brunt.</p>
                        <p>With particular respect to paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement,
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out
                            that it was so strictly worded that the United States would get into
                            just as much hot water if it introduced the other new weapons proposed
                            for the U.S. forces in Korea as it would if the 280 mm guns and the
                            Honest John rockets were also included. That is, if we were going to
                            meet difficulty in introducing any new equipment into Korea for our
                            forces, we might just as well go the whole hog and introduce the entire
                            list, including the two disputed items.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that the
                            Joint Chiefs also felt that as far as the military people around the
                            world were concerned, there was general agreement that the Communists
                            had not observed the Armistice. Indeed, their violations had been of an
                            extreme type, even though <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> agreed with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> in doubting that the Communists had introduced
                            atomic weapons into North Korea. There was no particular reason why they
                            should at this time, because Soviet planes capable of carrying atomic
                            bombs could be got very quickly to the Yalu River in the event that they
                            were needed. In summary, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> stated that the Joint Chiefs believed that from
                            the military point of view anything short of the total proposal
                            submitted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the package deal in South
                            Korea, would be inadequate to meet a surprise attack by the Communists
                            on South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> observed that
                            in addition to the strong views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as stated
                            by <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, he <pb
                                n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0452"/>would like to add another
                            consideration—namely, one from the domestic political point of view.
                            First, however, he pointed out that the Defense Department did not share
                            the apparent view of the Department of State that once we had secured
                            the removal of the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss> teams the
                            United States would seek no further change in the Armistice Agreement
                            and in particular with respect to paragraph 13(d) of these terms.
                            Returning to his initial point. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> indicated that a number of prominent members
                            of Congress, as well as distinguished citizens like Dr. <persName>John
                                Hannah</persName>,<note n="9" xml:id="d212fn9">John A. Hannah,
                                President of Michigan State University and former Assistant
                                Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Personnel, 1953–1954.</note>
                            had recently been to Korea and had come back with very strong views
                            about the inadequacy of our defenses. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> warned that as a result the
                            Administration would be exposed to very difficult questions as to why it
                            was not affording our troops in Korea the maximum possible
                            protection.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> observed that the
                            discussion up to this point had made very clear the breadth of the
                            disagreement between State and Defense. It appeared to him that the
                            Joint Chiefs’ attitude on the modernization of U.S. forces was, so to
                            speak, an all-or-nothing attitude. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> confirmed Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1"
                                >Cutler</persName>’s impression.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied to the
                            views earlier expressed by <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> by repeating his belief that if we proceeded
                            to modernize our forces with all the weapons suggested except the 280 mm
                            gun and the Honest John rocket, such a course of action would not
                            constitute a breach of the Armistice Agreement, but could be regarded
                            rather as an interpretation of paragraph 13(d). With respect to the
                            problem of Congressional criticism, Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> believed that we could point out
                            to our critics that we were using a whole lot of new weapons to
                            modernize our forces apart from the two types which we were presently
                            withholding.</p>
                        <p>At this point the President inquired whether at any time in the history
                            of the United States this country had deliberately broken the terms of
                            an international agreement. Turning to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName>, the President observed that the Admiral
                            appeared to be carrying matters to extremes when he stated that
                            paragraph 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement made it possible for the
                            United States to send in a new type of weapon, such as a jet aircraft
                            with nuclear capabilities, as a replacement for a weapon that was no
                            longer in production in the United States. Such a course of action did
                            not appear to the President as a violation of the Armistice
                            Agreement.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied that
                            weapons like the 280 mm guns, which were primarily defensive in
                            character, were really more important to our forces in Korea than was
                            the stationing of squadrons of <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425" facs="0453"
                            />atomic capable jet aircraft in South Korea. In point of fact, the
                            Defense Department was not contemplating the permanent stationing of
                            squadrons of jet-atomic aircraft in Korea, but instead wished to rotate
                            squadrons to South Korea from Japan and elsewhere in order to provide
                            familiarity with the terrain. In any event, he repeated that weapons
                            like the 280 mm guns would be vital to the defense of cities like Seoul
                            which were close to the North Korean border.</p>
                        <p>Thereafter, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> directed the
                            Council’s attention to paragraph 19, as quoted above, and said that this
                            seemed to put the question to the President in clear terms. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                            arrangements for the new military program in Korea constituted
                            essentially a package deal. The active divisions of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army were to be reduced in phase with
                            the modernization of U.S. forces in Korea. It seemed to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> to be the view of the Defense
                            Department that it would be undesirable to go forward with a portion of
                            the U.S. modernization program unless the program was complete and
                            included the 280 mm guns and the Honest John rockets. Also, Defense
                            presumably doubted the willingness of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> to reduce the number of active divisions unless these
                            two important items were included in the U.S. modernization program.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> commented that
                            the two disputed items seemed more important to the Department of
                            Defense than all the rest put together, and he doubted very much whether
                            the South Koreans could be brought to agree to reduce their active
                            divisions unless the U.S. modernization program included these two
                            items.</p>
                        <p>The President stated that of course it was the responsibility of the
                            Department of State to gauge the political effects of a military course
                            of action. He tended to agree, he said, with Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> that this particular moment,
                                [<hi rend="italic">3-1/2 lines of source text not
                            declassified</hi>]. However, the President did speculate as to whether,
                            if the 280 mm guns and the Honest John rockets were introduced along
                            with other weapons, the fact of their introduction would ever be
                            observed by the Communists or the Armistice Commission. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out at once
                            that it was necessary to report each item of replacement, which was why
                            he had felt that some of the military items which the State Department
                            had felt it would be appropriate to introduce would leave the impression
                            of being as great a violation as the two items questioned by the State
                            Department.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> observed that
                            public reactions are not always based on the pure logic of the
                            situation. Whatever the logic, the fact was that we would get a hell of
                            a repercussion around the world if we gave our forces the 280 mm gun and
                            the Honest John rocket. He again repeated that he had made every effort
                            to accommodate himself to the position of the Department of Defense. In
                            fact, in the course of his briefings in the State Department in
                            preparation for this <pb n="426" xml:id="pg_426" facs="0454"/>meeting,
                            he had argued vigorously in favor of the Defense Department position,
                            but in the last analysis he had failed to convince himself that these
                            two items should be included.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> inquired of
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> what further
                            evidence the latter thought would be required in order to convince our
                            friends and allies of the large-scale Communist violation of the
                            Armistice terms. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            doubted if any further evidence would so convince them, and repeated
                            that the State Department was still firmly of the opinion that the
                            changes in the weapons for our forces in Korea should be made as an
                            interpretation of the terms of the Armistice rather than being based on
                            a breach of the Armistice terms. Perhaps it was true that we could not
                            induce <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to approve our package
                            military programs and reduce his active divisions unless these two
                            disputed weapons were included. This, however, was no reason to go along
                            with <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, because essentially
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> wanted to see the
                            Armistice Agreement completely destroyed. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> added that the position he was
                            taking today on this dispute was not to be interpreted to indicate that
                            we could not, perhaps in a year or two, find it possible to add the 280
                            mm guns and the Honest John rockets to our modernization program for the
                            U.S. forces in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> turned to the President
                            and said that the President seemed to agree with the Secretary of State.
                            The President replied in the affirmative, [<hi rend="italic">5 lines of
                                source text not declassified</hi>]. There was a job of education to
                            be done, and he accordingly doubted the wisdom of agreeing with the
                            proposed action of the Department of Defense. He therefore suggested
                            that Council action on this paper be held in abeyance until we could
                            talk this issue over with some of our reliable allies, particularly our
                                <gloss target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> allies. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out to the

                                declassified</hi>]. The President replied that even so, we still
                            needed our alliances, and we must therefore move cautiously. It would be
                            better if Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Allen Dulles</persName> and <persName

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained the
                            problem facing the United States Government with respect to its forces
                            in Korea along the lines of the attached talking paper<note n="2"
                                xml:id="d213fn2">Not printed.</note> stressing that the Communist
                            side from the beginning had had no intention of abiding by the terms of
                            the Korean Armistice Agreement. With respect to Korea the Communists’
                            intention was to saddle the United Nations Command (<gloss
                                target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>) with an agreement designed to hold
                            their forces static while providing their own forces an umbrella for a
                            military buildup. The result of the subsequent deliberate evasions of
                            the Armistice terms had been the creation of a situation whereby there
                            was now greater Communist military strength in north Korea than at the
                            time of the signature of the Armistice and, consequently, a weaker
                            position for the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> Allies at any
                            future conference table.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>, assisted by
                            charts and photographs, then reviewed <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429"
                                facs="0457"/>in some detail the various ways in which the Communists
                            had evaded or violated the Armistice terms. He referred specifically to
                            the frustrations met by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission
                                (<gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>), the failure of the
                            Communists to report their equipment introductions, the rebuilding of
                            destroyed airfields, and the introduction of a modern airforce as
                            evidenced by photographs, radar tracks, Communist admissions, and the
                            reports of defectors. The Admiral mentioned the growing pressure of the
                            American public, press, and Congress against the continuation of a
                            policy which placed American troops in grave jeopardy in Korea. He said
                            there was no doubt in his mind or on the part of the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff or military leaders in the field but that the United States must
                            either modernize its forces in Korea or face the consequences of
                            disastrous military defeat there. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> then reviewed a list of weapons<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d213fn3">Attached but not printed; the list is identical to
                                the attachment to <ref target="#d209">Document 209</ref>.</note>
                            which the Joint Chiefs of Staff desired to authorize <gloss
                                target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> to introduce.</p>
                        <p>In concluding the United States’ presentation, Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that the military
                            problem was obvious and that he fully recognized that there was also a
                            most difficult political problem on which he desired the best advice and
                            counsel of the governments represented at the meeting.</p>
                        <p>A discussion led by Ambassadors <persName corresp="#p_CSH1"
                                >Caccia</persName> and Munro then ensued. The principal point around
                            which the remarks of the four Embassy representatives concentrated was
                            the need to have, more specifically, the United States plan both as to
                            the timing and as to the presentation to world opinion of the action
                            contemplated. Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName>
                            referred to the recent talks in Washington with the British Defense
                            Minister and repeated the British attitude at that time that the United
                            Kingdom would approach the problem in the spirit of obtaining an
                            equitable and sensible result. In brief, what were the best arguments to
                            employ to win the battle? Should the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss>
                            take the initiative with a public statement or a letter to the United
                            Nations Secretary General, or should it say nothing and await the
                            inevitable Communist challenge? Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1"
                                >Caccia</persName> then pointed out that the methods and timing
                            proposed would have a very material bearing on the position which his
                            Government would take.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Munro agreed that some knowledge of the timing and methods
                            contemplated was essential in order to obtain his Government’s position.
                            For example, whereas <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> had produced charts to demonstrate Communist
                            violations, how could these be proved to the satisfaction of world
                            public opinion at large? In response <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430"
                                facs="0458"/>to Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1"
                                >Caccia</persName>’s inquiry, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said that some of the material he had used could
                            be made public.</p>
                        <p>When Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> repeated that
                            the objective of the meeting was to present the problem and to solicit
                            any ideas the Commonwealth representatives might have as to how to
                            proceed, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> asked
                            whether the use of a liberal interpretation of Article 13(d) in order to
                            maintain the military balance had been discarded. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> confirmed that it had not,
                            and expressed the view that two methods were worthy of consideration,
                            namely, a liberal interpretation of Article 13(d) or its suspension.
                            There were advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Munro, expressing his personal view, said he thought surely
                            there must be some way whereby one side to an agreement, following a
                            breach of part of the agreement by the other party, would have some
                            recourse without nullifying the agreement as a whole. Specifically, he
                            was certain his Government would wish to know when the United States
                            intended to introduce the new equipment and in what quantities. He was
                            particularly fearful as to the timing. Were the action to be deferred
                            until just prior to the September United Nations General Assembly, he
                            felt that the United States would be in for serious trouble. Mr.
                                <persName>Booker</persName> agreed that were the action taken just
                            prior to or during the General Assembly, it would have undesirable
                            consequences. He said his Government, too, would wish to know more
                            specifically the United States’ plans for proceeding. Mr.
                                <persName>Maybee</persName> agreed that this would also be the case
                            with the Canadian Government. It would wish to know, for example, what
                            was envisaged for the <gloss target="#t_NNSC1">NNSC</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> then asked
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> whether in
                            the latter’s opinion the action contemplated might not provide the
                            Communist side a pretext for abandoning the Armistice and renewing
                            hostilities. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            replied “definitely not,” and said that on the contrary a continuation
                            of weakness would encourage a Communist attack.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Munro stressed again the necessity of coming up with a
                            definite date as to timing and, in response to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s request for clarification,
                            pointed out that were the <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> to proceed
                            with a “fait accompli” there would at least be time for feelings to
                            quiet down before the September General Assembly. Were the action to be
                            taken then, the reaction might be undesirable.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Booker</persName> asked whether the idea of proceeding
                            surreptitiously had been ruled out and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> replied that nothing had been ruled out but
                            that in his personal view he felt that the action should be taken
                            honestly and above board. Mr. <persName>Booker</persName> said that his
                            Government was committed to this course.</p>
                        <p>The meeting closed with agreement that the views of the Governments <pb
                                n="431" xml:id="pg_431" facs="0459"/>concerned would be obtained on
                            the method of introducing modern weapons and that, meanwhile, the United
                            States Government would begin preparation of a specific plan as to the
                            timing and method of presentation for further discussion.</p>

                            to modernize its arsenal in South Korea as a “bold stroke” against the
                            Communists.</p>

                            previous meeting on this subject, April 23, 1957,<note n="2"

                            during which the problem of modernization had been presented, said that
                            he now wished to propose for consideration an outline plan as to the
                            timing and presentation should it be decided to introduce new weapons
                            into Korea. Such a plan had been requested by the Commonwealth
                            representatives at the last meeting. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> then read from a talking paper (copy
                                attached).<note n="3" xml:id="d216fn3">Not printed. According to the
                                talking paper, <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                                explained that the Senior U.N. Command Representative in the
                                Military Armistice Commission would make a statement at Panmunjom,
                                no later than July 1, in which he would review Communist violations
                                of the Armistice Agreement and draw the conclusion that, in view of
                                Communist violations of paragraph 13d, the U.N. Command considered
                                that it was entitled to be relieved of corresponding obligations
                                under the Armistice until the relative military balance was restored
                                and the Communist side had demonstrated a willingness to comply with
                                the provisions of the Armistice. To restore the military balance,
                                the U.N. Command intended to replace existing weapons with new
                                weapons currently available. In so doing, however, the <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> did not intend to start an arms
                                race, would deploy new weapons only for defensive purposes, and
                                intended to observe all provisions of the Armistice Agreement other
                                than those from which it was relieved by Communist violations of the
                                agreement. The Unified Command would transmit a full report on the
                                action to the United Nations no later than August 1.</note></p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName> opened the
                            discussion of the proposed plan by saying that as the Department knew,
                            the British Government viewed the problem sympathetically, and wished to
                            be as helpful as possible. According to all indications, the British
                            Government would be able to go along with the procedure suggested but
                            would hope that the following points could be met: <list>

                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The United Nations Command should make it clear that it had no

                                    by an official report as soon after the Military Armistice

                                    be informed of <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0463"/>the
                                    action contemplated before the announcement, as should the
                                    Swedes and Swiss.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> expressed the view
                            that each of these points was, in fact, covered in the plan outlined or
                            paralleled the Department’s ideas as to the proper procedure to be
                            followed. The Department planned to consult France, Turkey, and Thailand
                            and to notify the full Sixteen, together with the Swiss and Swedes, of
                            the decision and plans for implementation prior to any public
                            announcement.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Munro said he was in substantial agreement with Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName>’s remarks but, in
                            particular, desired express assurances that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces would not be given any dual-capable weapons. He,
                            furthermore, would not like any impression given that the idea was to
                            match Communist violations. With respect to the language of the draft
                            plan, he did not like characterizing the Communist violations as
                            “striking at the very heart of the Agreement.” This made it appear that
                            the ultimate intention was to abrogate the Armistice as a whole. He
                            would hope also that the report to the United Nations could be
                            transmitted much earlier than August 1. With respect to notifying the
                            other Allies, Ambassador Munro pointed out the difficulty of
                            differentiating between Allies. In conclusion, he asked whether the U.S.
                            was thinking of a simultaneous reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces.</p>
                        <p>Responding to Ambassador Munro’s points, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> assured him that no consideration was being
                            given to atomic weapons for the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            forces. We were thinking in terms of a reduction of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces which was one of the purposes of
                            providing U.S. forces with new weapons. Reaching agreement with the
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> might take some time, however.
                            At this point, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> said
                            that it was the hope of Defense to begin negotiation with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> immediately following the Military
                            Armistice Commission announcement with a view to reducing their forces,
                            but that agreement would take time. Continuing in reply to Ambassador
                            Munro Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>, referring to
                            more extensive consultation with the Allies, said that he wished to make
                            it clear that the U.S. had no intention of submitting the issue to the
                            United Nations for permission to go ahead, thus enabling a veto by those
                            who have no stake in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador Spender voiced general agreement with the proposed plan.
                            Pointing out that in 1953 the Armistice Agreement was designed to freeze
                            the status quo, he suggested that this be so stated rather than relying
                            solely on the idea of “preserving the military balance.” With respect to
                            the final paragraph of the proposed Military Armistice Commission
                            statement, he questioned the language used since it seemed to imply much
                            wider suspensions of obligations than merely under paragraph 13(d).
                            Supporting Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_CSH1">Caccia</persName>,
                            Ambassador <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0464"/>Spender said that
                            this was essentially an exercise in public relations and that it was
                            extremely important to prove the breach. Finally, Australia could never
                            countenance giving dual-purpose weapons to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces. In response to Ambassador Spender, Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that, subject
                            to approval by the lawyers, he was perfectly agreeable to a change of
                            language suggested for the final paragraph of the proposed Military
                            Armistice Commission statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Rae</persName>, speaking informally, confirmed that the
                            Canadian Government understood the problem, was sympathetic toward the
                            United Nations Command position, and also wished to be helpful. He was
                            in full support of the feeling of his colleagues that it was essential
                            that specific documentation of Communist violations be made public.
                            Also, he thought it advisable that the United Nations Command reaffirm
                            its adherence to the cease fire. Would it not also be desirable for the
                            United Nations Command to state that it had no intention of increasing
                            its forces above the 1953 level? The Canadian Government would also wish
                            to know whether the United Natioins Command intended to continue to
                            submit reports to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Finally,
                            had any thought been given to the possibility of renegotiating paragraph
                            13(d) with the Communists?</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> agreed that it would
                            be desirable to make it clear that the United Nations Command intended
                            to continue to abide by the cease fire. The United Nations Command could
                            not, however, give assurances that its forces would not be increased
                            unless the Communists gave like assurances. With respect to
                            renegotiating a part of the Armistice, such a course was unthinkable.
                            The Communists still held American prisoners in China, in violation of
                            all their agreed undertakings; 450 American soldiers remain unaccounted
                            for. Of the four principal provisions of the Armistice, namely a cease
                            fire, exchange of prisoners, maintenance of the military balance, and a
                            political settlement, the Communists had refused to adhere to three.
                            Only with respect to a cease fire had they performed their obligation
                            under the Armistice. What advantage would there be in making a new
                            agreement to replace one which the Communists had flagrantly
                            violated?</p>
                        <p>A discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of continuing to report
                            to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission followed. Mr.
                                <persName>Deckert</persName> expressed the view that it was not the
                            intention of the U.S. Government to continue to report and that in being
                            relieved of its obligations under paragraph 13(d) by the Communist
                            violations of the paragraph, reporting responsibilities were included.
                            Captain Mott said that some thought had been given reporting perhaps in
                            more general terms. <persName corresp="#p_TGNF1">General
                                Twining</persName> expressed the view that <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> did not wish to be
                            bound by reporting. Mr. <persName>Deckert</persName> pointed <pb n="437"
                                xml:id="pg_437" facs="0465"/>out that should reporting continue, the
                            Communists would have a propaganda opening. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said he had always felt that
                            in suspending obligations under paragraph 13(d), reporting was
                                included.<note n="4" xml:id="d216fn4">On June 21, on the same day

                                20, which concluded with an assessment of the Thai, Turkish, and

                        <p>In view of the lack of opposition among those of our Allies thus far
                            consulted, and the timing factors involved, I believe we should push
                            toward National Security Council reconsideration of the Korean paper
                                (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1) at the earliest
                            possible date so that in the event a decision favorable to providing
                            United States forces in Korea with dual-purpose weapons is reached, the
                            steps incident to its implementation may be gotten under way prior to
                            July 1, 1957.</p>

                                characteristics. They are too limited in range for use in

                                in Europe, and we do not have a <gloss target="#t_NATO1"

                                public admission of a wasteful and futile effort to make the Army

                            <item>In sum, these two bulky, cumbersome, obsolescent weapons have
                                little significance for “modernization” of our forces. They have
                                even less for “standardization” of our defenses. Modernization of
                                our forces in Korea should and can be sought in improving air-atomic
                                capabilities. The introduction of the 280 and the Honest John seem
                                justified only as an attempt to facilitate or to finance their
                                replacement by more efficient models at home. The political costs in
                                such an attempt seem wholly exorbitant.</item>

                        <p>The Secretary said that he had never been satisfied that there was a
                            military necessity for introducing dual-purpose weapons into Korea. He
                            said that in his judgment the deterrent power of the U.S. is adequately
                            taken care of through the U.S. capabilities in Okinawa and Japan. He
                            said that the only reason he would favor introducing dual-purpose
                            weapons into Korea would be to bring about the reduction of expense of
                            U.S. military assistance in Korea. In other words, he is thinking of it
                            in terms of a budgetary money saving operation rather than in terms of a
                            strategic military operation. The Secretary does not get the impression
                            from reading Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s
                            paper that the budgetary consideration has been the primary factor
                            leading to the recommendation.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary said that he would not be prepared to approve the
                            introduction of dual-purpose weapons into Korea unless it could be shown
                            to him that such a step was essential in order to bring about the
                            reduction of Korean forces and the expense of military assistance in
                            Korea, and would, in fact, lead to this result.</p>

                            reference to the revised paragraphs 9, 10 and 19–b,<note n="5"
                                xml:id="d221fn5">The revised portions of these paragraphs continued
                                to reflect the divergence of views between the Department of State
                                and the Department of Defense–Joint Chiefs of Staff that had existed
                                since the beginning of the policy review A basic difference involved
                                paragraph 9c. The Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                version of paragraph 9c stipulated that U.S. forces in Korea should
                                be equipped with modern weapons, such as Honest John rockets and 280
                                mm. atomic-capable cannons. The State version of the paragraph
                                qualified the authorization to introduce such weapons by stipulating
                                that the action must be based upon “reasonable support” from the
                                principal allies of the United States, and must result in desired
                                reductions in military assistance for Korea and in Republic of Korea
                                force levels. The Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>
                                position on paragraph 10, which related to force level reductions on
                                the part of the Republic of Korea, was that such reductions should
                                be undertaken only if the Defense–<gloss target="#t_JCS1"
                                    >JCS</gloss> position on paragraph 9c was adopted. In paragraph
                                19b, the Department of State proposed that if atomic-capable weapons
                                were introduced into Korea, the timing and method of the public
                                presentation of the announcement and the introduction should be
                                determined by the Secretaries of State and Defense, taking into
                                account the views of principal allies. The Defense–<gloss

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> first called on
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> for comment.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            State Department agreed that at the earliest possible date a statement
                            should be made to the appropriate <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                            authority that, in view of Communist violation of the Korean Armistice
                            Agreement, the United States proposed henceforth to exercise greater
                            flexibility in the armaments maintained in South Korea. On this point,
                            at least, there was no dispute between State and Defense. Thereafter,
                            however, we come to the second phase: What, precisely, do we do to
                            implement the policy set forth in the initial statement referred to
                            above? We in the State Department, continued Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, were inclined to feel that it
                            would be much preferable if we could confine our [<hi rend="italic">less

                            dual-purpose weapons (both conventional and nuclear), [<hi rend="italic"
                                >1-1/2 lines of source text not declassified</hi>]. For when you
                            begin to put into foreign territory very conspicuous weapons [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            there was bound to be a great degree of difficulty. In particular,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said he had in
                            mind these huge 280 mm. guns, for which it was necessary to rebuild
                            roads and bridges so that the guns could be transported. He could not
                            understand why in the world it was essential that we be able to haul
                            these great monsters around. In any case, to advertise the existence of
                            such huge weapons as these would be bound to cause very serious
                            repercussions for the United States throughout Asia. Sending such
                            weapons to Korea would be resented throughout Asia because such [<hi

                            were identified with the West and with the hated doctrine of white
                            supremacy, quite apart from the weapons effects themselves. [<hi

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that as a
                            result of the proposed package deal, the United States would save $127
                            million in costs to South Korea over a period of four years. Again
                            citing the figures in the Financial Appendix to support his argument,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> reiterated his
                            belief that the savings that we would realize from the introduction of

                            (copies of which had been distributed to the Council members) would
                            scarcely compensate for the political and propaganda liabilities which
                            would be thrust upon us. Indeed, said Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, he was not even sure that there
                            was a necessary interdependence between the introduction of these modern
                            weapons and the reductions in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed
                            forces.</p>
                        <p>In summary, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            stated his feeling that the proper way to proceed in this program was,
                            first of all, to serve the notice of our intentions that he had spoken
                            of initially; and thereafter sit <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0474"
                            />down and negotiate with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            authorities in order to determine what we can do to induce the desired
                            reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active forces. He
                            expressed the hope that we could achieve the desired reduction in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces by providing dual-purpose
                            weapons for modernizing U.S. forces in South Korea, but avoid paying the
                            higher price of introducing such monster weapons as the 280 mm. guns and
                            the Honest John rockets.</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the 280 mm. gun really was so clumsy and
                            so immobile a weapon. He added that in general he had very little
                            confidence in immobile weapons. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> replied that he didn’t think the 280 mm. gun was
                            quite as bad as it had been depicted, but at any rate we were not
                            manufacturing any more. However, we had five or six such guns in
                            Germany, and they were proving useful, even though they were now five or
                            six years old and would gradually be replaced. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> added that in a technical sense
                            both the 280 mm. gun and the Honest John rocket could be described as
                            dual-purpose weapons; [<hi rend="italic">2 lines of source text not

                        <p>Governor Stassen passed a note to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, who then pointed out the possible threat of some
                            counter move by the Soviets or the Chinese Communists if such weapons
                            were introduced.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> commented that
                            the position of the Department of Defense could be summarized in the
                            following terms: The Department felt that we must move into this
                            situation very promptly if any changes were to be made in the existing
                            levels of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> armed forces. Far from
                            wishing to reduce their active divisions, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss>s wish to increase their active divisions. Accordingly,
                            it would be wise for the United States to possess a free hand in
                            modernizing its forces in South Korea with all available weapons, if we
                            hope to bargain successfully with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> for a reduction of their own forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that what
                            really concerned him was what we thought we saw down the road in Korea.
                            Did we propose to go on spending $600 million a year in assistance to
                            South Korea for the rest of our natural lives? Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> replied that the outlook was
                            certainly not very promising, but that he did not see any better course
                            of action until and unless some unforeseen break should occur.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> pointed out that the
                            reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active divisions, as
                            set forth in the package deal in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5702/1, was only the first step. It was hoped that further reductions
                            could be achieved later and, in any event, acceptance by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> of this package deal would result in
                            savings for the United States of $127 million over a period of four
                            years. Both Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0475"/>commented that they did not
                            believe this saving in itself to be of very great significance.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> expressed
                            surprise that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            would scorn a saving of $127 million. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> then went on to state that the Council
                            might be somewhat confused as to precisely what the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff had in mind in suggesting the package deal set forth in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1. The United States, he pointed
                            out, has some 60,000 troops in Korea, our two divisions rotating on a
                            front line which stretched for 150 miles. Except for a Turkish brigade,
                            there were practically no other <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> troops
                            in Korea. While, as the Secretary of State had pointed out, a U.S.
                            nuclear offensive [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] would eventually stop any Communist invasion of
                            South Korea, the Communists could not be stopped before they had overrun
                            the 60,000 U.S. troops. Hence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff felt that
                            defensive [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] should actually be in place in South Korea to
                            protect the security of our own U.S. troops and to prevent them from
                            being overrun in the initial phases of a Communist offensive. Moreover,
                            from the point of view of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s
                            themselves, their capital, Seoul, was only 25 miles distant from the
                            front lines; and since this capital had already been overrun three
                            times, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s were only too well aware
                            that it could be overrun once again. Accordingly, the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s also would feel much safer if the
                            invasion routes into South Korea were covered by defensive [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            deployed and in place.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, said <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>,
                            we do not actually know precisely what the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> authorities will agree to by way of a reduction of
                            their own forces. We think they will agree to reduce their 20 active
                            divisions by four, and they might be willing to eliminate these four
                            divisions, which would reduce the total <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces to 16 active divisions and 10 reserve divisions.
                            We might be able eventually to reduce even more. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>, for example,
                            thought that at some future time we might induce the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s to reduce to a level of 10 active and
                            10 reserve divisions. But in any case, our Number One reason for wanting
                            to introduce the Honest John rockets and the 280 mm. guns for our forces
                            in South Korea, was to provide for the security of these U.S. forces in
                            South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, continued <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName>, he had often discussed these nuclear weapons in
                            the course of his visits to the various countries of the Far East. Most
                            of the military men in the friendly nations of Asia accepted such
                            weapons. The only exception, where there was still a strong hostile
                            feeling toward nuclear weapons, was Japan; and even in Japan many
                            military men and diplomats agreed on the vital necessity of an atomic
                            defense.</p>
                        <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0476"/>
                        <p>Fourthly, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said
                            that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were convinced that they could not
                            continue military planning along the lines agreed in our basic policy
                            without being able to count on the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
                        <p>Finally, <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said,
                            there was the related problem of the command of <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> forces in Korea. If the United States reduced its forces
                            in Korea much below their present size, we might find real difficulty in
                            retaining a U.S. military man as head of the <gloss target="#t_UN1"
                                >UN</gloss> Command. The Koreans would wish to have one of their own
                            nationals as the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander. And if
                            some incident occurred which resulted in a renewal of hostilities
                            between North and South Korea, we might well not ever be able to
                            determine which side was responsible for renewing the war.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            again stressed the fact that the Joint Chiefs of Staff felt that the
                            Council’s decision with respect to the package deal in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1 would be a crucial decision from
                            the military point of view. The Joint Chiefs simply could not see their
                            way to assure the security of U.S. forces in Korea unless we were in a
                            position to equip our forces there with the complete list of modern
                            weapons.</p>
                        <p>[<hi rend="italic">1 paragraph (12-1/2 lines of source text) not
                                declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_BPF1">Brundage</persName> complained that when
                            the Council initiated its study of a package deal for reducing U.S.
                            forces in Korea, we had hoped that we could not only cut the costs of
                            U.S. military assistance to South Korea, but that we could also cut the
                            costs of maintaining U.S. forces in South Korea. At the present time
                            there seemed very little prospect that this latter objective could be
                            achieved. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            agreed, and said that it was extremely difficult to see what the future
                            would bring, in view of the steadily increasing cost of U.S. defense
                            programs and new weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that the
                            only answer was to keep working on our objective of convincing all our
                            allies to depend more on the deterrent capacity of our nuclear
                            retaliatory capability, and less on local defenses. There simply was not
                            going to be enough money available to maintain both the U.S. deterrent
                            capability and large military establishments in allied countries
                            throughout the world. We must project into the future for South Korea
                            something that is far less costly than the present area defense system
                            in South Korea. This must move ahead with the deterrent theory, with the
                            theory that the real deterrent to aggression rests in the existence in
                            the United States of a great retaliatory capability. Nevertheless,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> reiterated his
                            feeling that if the Council were to adopt the package deal proposed by
                            the Department of Defense in paragraphs 9 and 10 of <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1, we should be incurring a very
                            heavy liability and one for which we would get no adequate return. If we
                            are going to <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0477"/>deploy these
                            particular weapons—the Honest John rockets and the 280 mm. guns—we
                            should insist that the reduction of active <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces be much more substantial.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out that
                            the problem we are thus confronting in South Korea was not confined to
                            that country alone, but applied also to Germany and to all the other
                            areas around the perimeter of the Soviet Union. Everywhere, accordingly,
                            we faced this problem of convincing our allies that we do possess the
                            necessary nuclear deterrent to aggression and that we are prepared to
                            use this deterrent in case these allies are attacked. Most of our allies
                            are still not convinced of this determination, and that is why they
                            insist on seeing military power in being and situated in their own
                            territories which are exposed to Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that he
                            could not deny the validity of <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName>’s argument, but the real question was—do we want
                            to continue the existence of large local military establishments in
                            Europe, or do we prefer to maintain these local military forces in South
                            Korea? With the rising costs of weapons, we could not do both.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> replied to
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> by pointing
                            out that if the United States lost South Korea it would presently lose
                            its entire position in the Far East. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >General Lemnitzer</persName> had stated that the limit that he can
                            go down to, in terms of active divisions in South Korea, is the number
                            of divisions required to patrol the long front line. He believed that 10
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active divisions were too few,
                            but that some number between 10 and 16 active divisions, including the
                            U.S. divisions and the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Marine
                            division, might be appropriate.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> responded by
                            pointing out that as we looked ahead we must think in terms of U.S.
                            deterrent nuclear power being the answer to the defense of the Free
                            World, and contemplate the redeployment of our U.S. forces from foreign
                            areas. We must not only begin to think in these terms, but we must begin
                            promptly to move our forces out. Our allies won’t like it, but they will
                            in effect have to accept it. It is not necessary for the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> to agree to the departure of our
                            forces; we will be polite but firm. On the other hand, if we continue
                            with our present deployments overseas and with the costs of new weapons
                            mounting every day, the financial situation will become altogether
                            hopeless.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> answered that the
                            problem outlined by Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1"
                                >Humphrey</persName> was the problem that the Joint Chiefs of Staff
                            were wrestling with every day. It has long been our policy to redeploy
                            U.S. forces from overseas, but we have simply not been successful in
                            selling this policy to our allies.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> turned to Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> and asked him
                            whether he was proposing to continue to help the South Koreans or simply
                                <pb n="450" xml:id="pg_450" facs="0478"/>to abandon them. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> repeated his views
                            on reliance on the U.S. deterrent capability.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> and inquired what conceivable reason there was
                            that both of our U.S. divisions in Korea should be located continuously
                            on the front line. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> replied that only one at a time was in the front
                            line, but that both U.S. divisions were necessary to defend South Korea
                            against invasion and a sudden overrunning of its territory by the
                            Communists. Governor Stassen pointed out that it would be extremely
                            difficult to get allies like the South Koreans voluntarily to consent to
                            the redeployment of U.S. forces because of the loss of the foreign
                            exchange which accrued through the expenditures of U.S. military
                            personnel. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName>
                            stated that it was still hard for him to see why this should be
                            difficult. Admittedly we must be polite and diplomatic; but the United
                            States hardly needed anyone’s consent but its own to the redeployment of
                            its own armed forces. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> pointed out that the United States would find it
                            very hard to hold its alliances together if it acted in such matters
                            arbitrarily.</p>
                        <p>The President turned to <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> at this point and said that he certainly agreed
                            that the United States should introduce into Korea jet aircraft capable
                            of carrying nuclear weapons; but if we had these nuclear-capable jet
                            aircraft together with all the other modern weapons in the list, this
                            would certainly constitute a considerable atomic capability ready to use
                            in Korea. Moreover, it was not necessary to inform anybody about the
                            deployment [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] in South Korea, except, of course, if you also
                            put in the Honest Johns and the 280 mm. guns. These were so conspicuous
                            that you would have to explain their introduction to the whole world, as
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> had pointed
                            out.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that in any
                            case we would have to tell the South Koreans what [<hi rend="italic"
                                >less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>] we were
                            introducing. Otherwise we should not be able to convince them of the
                            feasibility of reducing their own forces.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> expressed his
                            unalterable opposition to the United States maintaining a battle line
                            all around the world made up of forces equipped with nuclear weapons.
                            The over-all cost of such a course of action would be terrific. It was
                            this that worried him so constantly. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out in response his own view
                            that if in 1950 the United States had maintained the very small forces
                            it had in South Korea, we should probably have avoided the Korean
                            war.</p>
                        <p>The President looked around at the members of the Council and said that
                            we could continue to talk about this problem for weeks on end, but he
                            believed that in view of the State position we should begin by making
                            the proposed announcement on the introduction of <pb n="451"
                                xml:id="pg_451" facs="0479"/>new weapons for our forces in South
                            Korea. In point of fact we have two very good men representing us in
                            South Korea, in the persons of Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName>. Therefore, the second step was to direct them
                            to go and talk to <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and see if
                            we can make some kind of an arrangement for reducing <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces, but an arrangement that will
                            not include the introduction of [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>] the 280 mm. gun and the Honest
                            John rocket. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>
                            pointed out that such negotiations with the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> were bound to take a considerable time, and that
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> was due to
                            come home at the end of the month. The President replied that the
                            sensible thing was to have <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName> stay on for a while. This job was more
                            important for the time being than his job of Vice Chief of Staff of the
                            Army.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> turned to the
                            President and said he was puzzled about one aspect of the problem of the
                            package deal. He had himself taken part in certain of the negotiations
                            which had been directed by the President the last time the Council paper
                            was discussed—the negotiations with the United Kingdom, Australia and
                            New Zealand, etc. So far as <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> knew, representatives of these allied countries
                            had agreed with our proposal to modernize our forces in South Korea, and
                            they had actually read the list of weapons which we proposed to send to
                            South Korea. The only problem that had come up in the course of these
                            negotiations was whether we envisaged giving the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces nuclear weapons, which of course we had assured
                            them we did not intend to do. These allied representatives have also
                            recommended that if the United States determined on this course of
                            action to modernize our forces, we should do it very promptly. Otherwise
                            we were bound to run into difficulties in the United Nations. It was
                            believed that the introductory date should not be later than June
                            15.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> stated that he
                            was ready to move in this matter at once, and to make the announcement
                            of our intention to modernize our forces in Korea by next Monday.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that there
                            were still two questions remaining in his mind. The first of these was
                            that we did not wish to agree to report to the Military Armistice
                            Commission the modern weapons which we send into South Korea. Assistant
                            Secretary of Defense <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>
                            pointed out that the proposed statement as presently drafted did not
                            specify precisely what weapons were to be sent to South Korea. Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> agreed that such
                            precise specification was not desirable, and that what we sought was
                            flexibility. We should therefore confine our announcement to stating
                            that we are sending in modern weapons. Thereafter we will go to
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and begin our
                            negotiations with him. Admittedly such negotiations are likely to be
                            very difficult, but it is in the course of these negotiations that we
                                <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0480"/>shall become involved with
                            the question of the types of weapons involved in the modernization of
                            our forces. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then
                            repeated his view on the vital necessity of educating the world to
                            acceptance of the theory of U.S. deterrent power as the primary
                            safeguard of the Free World against Communist aggressions. He also
                            expressed strong doubt that the North Koreans or the Chinese Communists
                            would ever dare to launch an invasion of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> as long as they knew that we would use this retaliatory
                            power to wipe out their entire industrial capacity.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName>’s second point
                            consisted in stressing the importance of a final settlement of the Korea
                            problem and the achievement of a free and united Korea. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> did not suggest, in
                            answer to questions, how this objective might best be achieved.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> attempted
                            to suggest an appropriate action by the National Security Council in
                            terms, first, of issuing the proposed announcement that the United
                            States was modernizing its forces in Korea, and secondly, a directive to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> to begin
                            negotiations with President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            looking toward a reduction of current <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> force levels. He was interrupted by the President, who
                            again expressed his dislike of advertising our introduction of modern
                            weapons by including among them such monster weapons as the 280 mm. gun.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> said he
                            understood the problem, but hoped that the Defense Department could be
                            given some clear conception of the degree and kind of modernization of
                            our armed forces which was now being contemplated. The President replied
                            by stating his belief that [<hi rend="italic">8-1/2 lines of source text
                                not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>The Vice President pointed out the importance of what was to be said
                            about this course of action at press conferences of the President and
                            the Secretary of State after our announcement had been made public. The
                            press was sure to ask what precisely we meant by modern weapons, and it
                            was important to determine the answer. The President said that we would
                            simply refuse to disclose details of the weapons that we were going to
                            send.</p>
                        <p>In response to a further question on the nature of the Council action,
                            the President directed, in the first instance, that the Secretary of
                            State and the Secretary of Defense were to agree on a message to
                            Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> outlining the
                            general problem as we saw it here and directing them to see what they
                            could do to convince <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> of the
                            desirability of reducing <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> active
                            forces in return for the modernization of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Air Force and the modernization of our own U.S. forces
                            in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said he wished to
                            point out that, in a certain sense, the Council was confronted by an
                            entirely new situation in the interval since it had last considered the
                            Korean problem. All the <pb n="453" xml:id="pg_453" facs="0481"/>world
                            now knows that the United States is up against serious budgetary
                            problems. We can therefore go to <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> and tell him that we simply do not have the money
                            to maintain his forces in the style to which they have been accustomed.
                            We must certainly take a stronger line with <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> than we have in the past.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> inquired whether we
                            could direct Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>
                            and <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> to begin
                            their negotiations promptly and to report back to Washington not later
                            than July 1. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            replied that there was no chance that such negotiations could be
                            completed by July 1. He did, however, add that he hoped that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> could be held over
                            in Korea for the necessary time, for we should look upon these
                            negotiations as a major operation, as a truly drastic treatment.</p>
                        <p>Agreeing with Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_HGM1">Humphrey</persName> said that
                            drastic as the proposal was, it was merely the beginning of an operation
                            which we should have to conduct all over the world. In other words, at
                            long last the New Look has come home to roost with a vengeance.</p>
                        <p>However, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            concluded the discussion with a word of caution about too rapid
                            redeployment of U.S. forces from overseas, and expressed the thought
                            that, with the development of new tactical nuclear weapons, as outlined

                            the text seemed to be similar to the document discussed before. Mr.

                        <p>In reply to Sir Harold’s question as to informing Secretary General
                            Hammarskjold, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            confirmed that a <gloss target="#t_UNC1">UNC</gloss> report would be
                            submitted to the United Nations. Subsequent discussion developed that
                            this report would be submitted as soon as possible after the <gloss
                                target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> statement and no later than August 1,
                            1957.</p>
                        <p>Sir <persName>Harold</persName> then asked what plans were being made to
                            inform not just the United Nations but the press and the world at large
                            of the Communist violations of the Armistice. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said considerable thought had
                            been given to this point but that the Defense Department felt and the
                            Secretary of State concurred that at the <gloss target="#t_MAC1"
                                >MAC</gloss> meeting it would be inadvisable to submit any
                            supplementary data on violations. A good deal of the information now at
                            hand is classified and would have to be declassified before public use.
                            Furthermore, the Secretary felt very strongly that the release of such
                            information would give the Communists ammunition for their propaganda.
                            We would not, therefore, submit any evidence to accompany the statement.
                            Such evidence had, after all, been presented time and time again and we
                            had charged violations throughout three or four years.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> offered that the
                            Defense Department was working with the White House on a supplementary
                            statement to cover Communist violations which would be ready to use
                            after the announcement broke in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Sir Percy said there were two aspects to the general problem,
                            presentation to the public in order to make the best first initial
                            impact and second the submission of evidence to the United Nations to
                            support the first general statement. He expressed the hope that in the
                            Defense-White House statement two or three glaring examples of Communist
                            violations could be made. With respect to the United Nations, however, a
                            bit more was necessary and the case should be developed in more
                            detail.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that it would
                            be extremely helpful were the Governments concerned to issue supporting
                            statements following the announcement at Panmunjom. Sir Percy, Sir
                            Harold, and Mr. <persName>Rae</persName> all agreed but pointed to the
                            necessity of having at hand the U.S. supplementary statement so that
                            there would be “no cross play of cards.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>White</persName> suggested that there would be inquiries as
                            to the type of weapons to be introduced and asked how the U.S. would
                            deal with such queries. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> said “We are not going to answer that. We are
                            going to say that we are not going to comment on that—that is a military
                            problem and we will not comment.” Sir Harold pointed out that this was
                            the first question which would arise and Sir Percy said that it might
                            just be answered by saying that the U.S. forces ii: Korea were going to
                            be equipped in such a way as to <pb n="457" xml:id="pg_457" facs="0485"

                            in Korea, and maybe people realize this will sort of advertise the fact
                            that we made a mistake over there that we don’t want to repeat in

                        <p>President Eisenhower realizes this will be delicate and difficult

                            Eisenhower is willing to accept now. President feels that with
                            conditions remaining the same, a further reduction may ultimately be
                            made to 11 active divisions including Marines and 12 to 15 reserve
                            divisions but does not want you to press for this at this time. We would
                            prefer not adding to the reserve on account of this deactivation but
                            would apply the 2 to 1 ratio to later reductions.</p>

                            pleased with report generally, and was obviously very happy that

                            as he put it. He was resistant to idea of force reduction, however,
                            saying in effect that this could not be done at present.</p>

                        <p>At a June 21 meeting of the Military Armistice Commission at Panmunjom,
                            General H.L. Litzenberg, Senior U.N. Command Member, made a statement
                            detailing alleged Communist violations of paragraph 13d of the Armistice
                            Agreement and indicating that the U.N. Command would no longer consider
                            itself bound by the limitations imposed by that paragraph “until such
                            time as the relative military <pb n="461" xml:id="pg_461" facs="0489"

                            demonstrated its willingness to comply.” General Jung Kook Rok, Senior
                            Member representing the Korean People’s Army and the Chinese People’s
                            Volunteers, responded by denouncing the statement made by Litzenberg as
                            an attempt “to wreck the Armistice Agreement and turn South Korea into
                            an American base of atomic warfare”. The United Command Report on the
                            75th meeting of the <gloss target="#t_MAC1">MAC</gloss> is enclosed in
                            despatch 128 from Seoul, August 23. (Department of State, Central Files,

                        <p>Repeating the rationale that Communist violations of the Armistice
                            Agreement made the suspension of paragraph 13d a necessity, the United
                            States, in its capacity as the Unified Command, reported the action
                            taken in the Military Armistice Commission on June 21 to the U.N.

                            refrained (in agreement with <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName>) from reporting two comments by the old
                            gentleman. The first of these was injected into the conversation as
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> was first speaking
                            of the decision to bring in modern weapons; President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> queried “what good are they unless
                            we have the right to use them?” The second, which came later in the
                            conversation, was an invitation to <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> to join him in a “march North,” with the
                            suggestion that he was ready to approach Washington with such a
                            demand.</p>
                        <p>Both <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> and I felt that to
                            report these remarks in our telegrams on the conversation would lead to
                            misunderstandings on the part of many in Washington not fully familiar
                            with the situation here. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> was, of course, emotionally stirred by the news of
                            the U.S. decision, and I have observed that he is inclined to
                            exaggerated statements on such occasions. As a matter of fact, his
                            comments <pb n="462" xml:id="pg_462" facs="0490"/>were made in a
                            half-joking manner, and when <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >Lemnitzer</persName>, in connection with his second comment,
                            said—in the same jocular vein—“Don’t upset the apple cart, Mr.
                            President,” he rejoined that of course he was only voicing a personal
                            wish, but he nevertheless believed it the only right action.</p>
                        <p>All in all, I was satisfied with the conversation, except in one
                            particular. In his presentation of the U.S. decision and proposed
                            actions, <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">Lemnitzer</persName> referred only
                            in general terms—and not too emphatically—to the reduction in <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army forces, and made no effective
                            reply to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s remark
                            that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces could only be
                            reduced after unification of the country.</p>
                        <p>The conversation then drifted off (as conversations with him have a way
                            of doing these days) into a discussion of the need for additional
                            merchant vessels, and President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> spent some little time in reminding us that when
                            Korea obtained the CIMAVIs, he was blocked by <gloss target="#t_ECA1"
                                >ECA</gloss> personnel here, as well as the pro-Japanese State
                            Department, in his efforts to get 10,000 ton ships. This led to an
                            attempt by me to rebut his allegations of pro-Japanese sentiments in the
                            Department, as I feel it unwise, particularly in the presence of other
                            U.S. officials, to allow him to get away with these outrageous
                            statements. As the conversation was breaking up—Mrs. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had summoned us to lunch—I asked
                            for two minutes and attempted—as reported in my telegram—to sum up our
                            proposed actions and the supporting arguments and to make it clear that
                            the measures in support of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army
                            were dependent upon a reduction in strength. The discussion ended with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> again saying that a
                            reduction could not be carried through at this time, and my insisting
                            that it would be necessary because of the high cost of modern arms and
                            equipment.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, I had prepared a “talking paper,” which I thought might
                            serve as an informal record of our remarks, and in anticipation that the
                            point on reduction of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army strength
                            might not be adequately stressed, and I was able to leave this with
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. He should,
                            therefore, be in no doubt on this point.</p>
                        <p>I fear that we may have some little difficulty with the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>s on this matter, but I feel that we
                            must stand firm. To give in on this would mean storing up grave trouble
                            for ourselves on both economic and military aid programs in the coming
                            year.</p>
                        <p>With best wishes,</p>

                            want to express to you my deepest appreciation for the wise influence

                                Lemnitzer</persName>, I appealed to you to consider the measures
                            which needed to be taken to remedy the intolerable situation caused by
                            the Communists’ complete disregard of the limitations imposed by the
                            Armistice Agreement.</p>
                        <p>Now an important step has been taken to counterbalance the unfair build
                            up of Communist military strength in the northern part of our country
                            which has been taking place since the day the Armistice Agreement was
                            signed. It would have been a bold stroke for freedom if you had declared
                            the entire Armistice Agreement invalid in view of the repeated
                            violations of the Communist side and we hope that this further step will
                            follow. We cannot emphasize too strongly the influence such action would
                            have in Asia and throughout the world and the encouragement you would
                            have given to all people who are willing to take a courageous stand
                            against the ruthless forces of Communist aggression.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the reduction of manpower in our Army which was considered
                            in connection with the decision to send newly developed weapons to
                            Korea, I assure you, Mr. President, we will be more than willing to
                            agree to such reduction if this can be accomplished without weakening
                            our ability to achieve the establishment of a unified, independent and
                            democratic government in Korea which is the essential objective
                            reaffirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its
                            resolution of October 7, 1950,<note n="3" xml:id="d227fn3">General
                                Assembly Resolution 376 (V); U.N. doc. A/1775.</note> and the goal
                            for which we have all made great sacrifice. Until this objective is
                            achieved we feel compelled to bear the tremendous burden of maintaining
                            the present level of our defense forces. If the maintenance of the
                            present military strength can be accomplished through the introduction
                            of modern weapons, certainly we will give serious consideration to a
                            reduction of manpower. However, until information is made available <pb
                                n="464" xml:id="pg_464" facs="0492"/>to us concerning the

                            to our forces, the present level of forces must be maintained in the
                            face of the enemy threat that confronts us. We feel this is essential
                            not only for our own sake but for the sake of your great Nation as

                                Without these atomic capable weapons, the so-called modernization of
                                our Army forces in Korea following the abrogation of paragraph 13d
                                of the Armistice Agreement is an illusion.<note n="2"

                                    <item>Both weapons are needed for military purposes. The Honest
                                        John rocket is an effective area weapon well adapted for use
                                        in Korea. It is a major part of the firepower of the new
                                        type division (1 battery of 2 launchers for the infantry
                                        division) and should be introduced into the 7th and 24th
                                        Infantry Divisions when they are reorganized under the
                                        Pentomic concept. A military need exists also for the 280mm
                                        gun, a precision weapon to cover the critical avenues of
                                        approach to Seoul. This weapon provides the commander with a
                                        pinpoint means of delivering atomic munitions under all
                                        conditions of weather, and it is also an excellent
                                        conventional artillery piece. While the road net will impose
                                        some limitations on its movements, there is an ample area of
                                        maneuver for it on the critical west flank of the line of
                                        contact.</item>

                                        and the 280mm gun are necessary in Korea to add to the
                                        deterrent strength of the Army forces and to reassure our
                                        Korean allies. Concern over Communist criticism is pointless
                                        as the Communists, regardless of facts, are already charging
                                        the United Nations Command with making South Korea an atomic
                                        base. Both for military and psychological reasons, it is
                                        important that we make the atomic capability of Army forces
                                        in Korea a reality without delay.</item>

                                        completed by reorganizing the 7th and 24th Infantry
                                        Divisions under the “Pentomic Concept” and re-equipping
                                        Corps type units. Under this concept each division requires
                                        two Honest John launchers to provide long-range fire support
                                        on area type targets. The 280mm gun is required at Corps

                            letters on June 19, 1957, and June 24, 1957, counseling us to restore
                            the military balance which Communist violations of the Armistice
                            Agreement had upset and thanking us for our recent decision to redress
                            that balance by the introduction of more modern weapons.</p>
                        <p>I thank you for sending both these letters. I share your confidence that
                            our decision is the right one. <persName corresp="#p_YCYD1"
                                >You</persName> can rest assured, Mr. President, that the security
                            of the Republic of Korea is of deep concern to the United States, as it
                            is to yourself.</p>
                        <p>It has become imperative for our own budget, Mr. President, that the

                            present combat power be reduced. The modernization of United States

                            this country, the Mutual Defense Treaty between our two countries and
                            the Joint Policy Declaration signed by sixteen nations on July 27, 1953,
                            should more than compensate for your reductions. I know that you will
                            welcome the increasing effectiveness of our aid program and the
                            expansion to your own economy and over-all strength which will be
                            consequent on these military reductions.</p>
                        <p>These considerations, Mr. President, prompted my decision to instruct

                            improved equipment of the remainder. This plan, in all its aspects, has
                            my wholehearted personal support and must, in my judgment, be
                            accomplished soon for the attainment of our commonly-held

                                of the President’s letter. The Embassy added that the Minister of

                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> came in to
                            report to the President on the termination of the Far East Command. He
                            said that a turnover ceremony had been held in Tokyo, in which <persName
                                corresp="#p_SAFB1">Admiral Stump</persName> assumed the United
                            States responsibilities, and another had been held in Korea in which
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">General Decker</persName> assumed the
                            functions of the <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss> Commander-in-Chief.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said he
                            had also visited with the Generalissimo on Formosa, and had found him
                            somewhat low in spirits and quite worried over the effect that the
                            passage of time is having on the military and political situation of the
                            Chinese Nationalists. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> had also addressed the Ryukyuan legislature in
                            Okinawa, reviewing the progress that had been made since 1945 when they
                            were destitute to the present time.</p>
                        <p>He then went on to comment on two recent actions which he said were
                            tremendously helpful in the western Pacific. The first was the
                            suspension of Paragraph 13d of the Armistice; this is a great help to
                            maintaining a proper military posture in the area. The second was the
                            issuance of an Executive Order placing the administration of the Ryukyu
                            Islands on a sound basis. He said it was very good to have designated as
                            High Commissioner the same man who was in military command in the
                            Ryukyus. The President interjected that the principle of linking
                            military and civilian responsibility in a single individual is
                            fundamental to his concept of the functioning of the U.S. Joint Chiefs
                            of Staff. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> also
                            reported that the land program is well under way in Okinawa—this is the
                            program by which all land not strongly needed by the military forces is
                            returned to the civilian economy.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said that in
                            Korea there is a constant effort from the north to subvert the
                            government in the south, and to push infiltrators across the boundary
                            into South Korea. These carry narcotics and money, in an effort to bribe
                            and buy South Koreans. <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces are
                            alert to these attempts and capture a considerable number of these
                            agents. The line of contact is heavily wired and mined, with definite
                            check points for entry into the demilitarized zone, and with limited
                            cleared paths through the zone. He said that the idea of pulling back
                            from the armistice line so as to create a “no man’s land” has proved
                            most valuable. He said that the morale of U.S. troops along the front is
                            very high. The young Americans there are doing a fine job and have a
                            fine attitude. They take their responsibilities very seriously. Over the
                            last year or two, much better housing and training facilities have been
                            made available, with little or no loss in combat readiness. He added
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had sent his
                            warm personal <pb n="471" xml:id="pg_471" facs="0499"/>regards to the
                            President. Reverting later to Korea, he indicated that the presence of
                            our two divisions there is very important—essential in fact to our
                            retaining the command which has tremendous value to our whole position
                            in the area. The President indicated he was not thinking of pulling out
                            either of these divisions. He did, however, insist that with the coming
                            of modern weapons the units can be streamlined, and that divisions
                            should be modernized and reorganized. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >General Lemnitzer</persName> said that the new organization is
                            being placed in effect in Korea, and is proving to be a “shot in the
                            arm.” The President said what he is working for is a hard core stable
                            program, with the excess trimmed out, that can be maintained over the
                            years. He wants to cut down on manpower by exploiting weapons
                            possibilities to the full.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said there is
                            need for permission to bring the Honest John and 280 mm. guns into
                            Korea. The President asked how this matter stood, and I recalled that it
                            was left to be considered further after the initial suspension of
                            Paragraph 13d had been announced. The President said he felt that on
                            such actions, they should simply be taken without making a great public
                            announcement about them. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> said he strongly supported exactly the same
                            procedure—if people saw new weapons around and asked about them they
                            would be told that specific details as to timing, numbers, etc. were and
                            would remain classified. The President strongly endorsed this
                            procedure.</p>

                                    noted that the proposed U.S.–<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                    joint studies and planning for force level reductions would
                                    probably take several months to complete. He therefore
                                    questioned plans to designate him as a special representative of
                                    the Secretary of Defense to remain in Korea and oversee the

                            <item>Part 2. During a call on <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                Defense Minister Kim Chung Yul on 22 July at which Lieutenant
                                General Jae Hung Yu, chairman, <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> was also present, we discussed
                                the matter of reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                Forces. <persName>Kim</persName> agreed that some reduction was
                                desirable if it would result in strengthening the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy, but was concerned over any
                                cut in the forces defending the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                while the present state of suspended hostilities continues and the
                                communists retain their military capability in North Korea. He
                                stated that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and
                                the Korean people must be convinced that any reduction in
                                conventional forces will not endanger the security of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. He expressed his willingness to
                                work with the US in developing a plan for a phased reduction in
                                manpower provided some other compensating strength was made
                                available. He requested information as to the modern weapons
                                (meaning atomic capable weapons) which the US would make available
                                to compensate for the loss of ground combat power. I informed
                                Minister <persName>Kim</persName> that I did not know what modern
                                weapons would be made available to defend Korea, or when they could
                                be expected, but that I would attempt to find out. I assured him
                                that the US was firmly determined to defend <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                    >ROK</gloss> in the case of renewed commie aggression and that
                                our deterrent power should be taken into account even though most of
                                it was not located in Korea.</item>
                            <item>Part 3. Both Minister <persName>Kim</persName> and General Yu made
                                the point that it would be necessary to continue US aid at
                                approximately its present level if the force reduction was to be
                                reflected in the Korean economy. I informed them that this could not
                                be guaranteed since I was dependent on congressional
                                appropriations.</item>
                            <item>Part 4. When <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                    Lemnitzer</persName> discussed this matter with the present
                                Defense Minister’s predecessor, it was suggested that the matter of
                                force reduction be studied jointly by the US Staff and <gloss
                                    target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss>. I have thus far delayed
                                bilateral discussion with <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> pending completion of an
                                estimate of the situation by the US Staff; this estimate<note n="6"
                                    xml:id="d233fn6">Not found.</note> has now been completed. One
                                significant conclusion is <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0501"
                                />that in light of present enemy capabilities a minimum of 21
                                    US/<gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Divisions are required
                                initially for defense of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>. This
                                will involve certain risks and modification of missions; a reduction
                                below this figure cannot be justified from military considerations.
                                The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_JCS1">JCS</gloss> are also unilaterally studying
                                the possibility of force reduction with contemplated completion date
                                28 July. I have no information as to the tentative conclusions of
                                this study. Obviously, the results of the US study should not be
                                made known to them if they are to be asked to accept a cut below
                                what the US study concludes is a valid requirement. Furthermore, it
                                seems pointless to enter into any bilateral discussion until
                                knowledge is available here as to US plans to provide an acceptable
                                substitute for the proposed loss in ground power. Such information
                                must be quite specific as to type and time to be made available if
                                it is to be used advantageously.</item>
                            <item>Part 5. In my opinion, if information as to US plans can be
                                furnished the Defense Minister it will be possible to develop
                                jointly with him a plan for a phased reduction in present forces
                                which he will recommend to the President. Conversely, without it,
                                the possibilities of obtaining agreement are not promising. There is
                                no assurance that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> will accept a cut even if recommended by his
                                Defense Minister. However, to obtain the support of the latter, if
                                possible, appeared to be the most logical procedure.</item>
                            <item>Part 6. It is requested that information concerning US plans and
                                which is releasable to <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> officials
                                be furnished me at the earliest practicable date.</item>

                            Nations Command from Tokyo to Seoul, may have created some confusion in
                            the implementation of the modernization program which explains the lack
                            of complete and detailed information at this time.</p>
                        <p>We have been informed that on June 25, 1957 authority was given to the
                            theater command to proceed with implementation of the decision to
                            modernize United States forces in Korea. Under this authority, certain
                            types of equipment available in Japan, which were previously excluded
                            from introduction into Korea, were to be shipped to Korea. Other
                            equipment was to be requisitioned for delivery from depots in the United
                            States. Examples of the equipment involved include the M–47 tank (22
                            scheduled for delivery per month), the M–75 armored personnel carrier
                            and recoilless rifles. Requisitions for equipment to be delivered from
                            the United States have apparently been initiated. The types and amounts
                            of such equipment is currently being determined by Defense in
                            conjunction with the theater command. It is our understanding that the
                            modernization of United States forces in Korea is being implemented
                            within established priorities in view of the reorganization of all
                            United States divisions which is also currently underway. Defense has
                            requested a full report on the implementation of the modernization
                            program in Korea from the theater command.</p>
                        <p>The Department has not been kept fully informed on the modernization
                            program. I would like to suggest, therefore, that at the Joint Chiefs of
                            Staff meeting you request that a report describing the plans, equipment,
                            weapons, and delivery schedules under the program, be made available to
                            the Department.</p>

                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> requested an
                            appointment to express his worry about possible cuts in aid
                            appropriations in Congress. He explained that the Korean people are “up
                            in the air” about the matter.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> responded that he,
                            too, was very much worried, not only with respect to Korea but also in
                            terms of its impact throughout Asia. He added that the United States is
                            helping to support one million eight hundred thousand troops in Asia.
                            These anti-Communist forces represent an important factor in the
                            military balance. Even so, it looks most probable that cuts will be made
                            by the Congress. In this event there is only one way to adjust, and that
                            is to reduce the size of these standing armies. We will want to be sure,
                            however, that such reductions do not reduce military capabilities. The
                            development of nuclear weapons has in fact changed the character of
                            modern defense. However, their cost is astonishingly high. The
                            development of nuclear weapons has given man the power to destroy
                            himself. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated
                            that he intends to talk to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> about this matter the next time he sees him.
                            Certainly if there is World War III with nuclear bombs, there would be
                            colossal destruction and the winner will find himself on top of a heap
                            of ruins. This fact may preclude such weapons ever being used.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> must realize the
                            point which was included in the recent exchange of letters with
                            President Eisenhower that there is no way we can continue to furnish the
                            supplies for the present size <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force.
                            Of course, the decision to reduce the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> Army lies with the Government of the Republic of Korea.
                            However, with a cut in defense support, a continuation of the present
                            level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces could have
                            disastrous economic effects in Korea. He explained that we feel that the
                            United States deterrent power, modernization connected with the <gloss

                            the United States-Korean Mutual Defense Treaty and the Joint Policy
                            Declaration of the Sixteen of July 27, 1953 are the real deterrents to
                            Communist aggression in Korea.</p>
                        <p>We know that the Communists are being strained. Recently, Mr.
                                <persName>Khrushchev</persName> complained of the drain on the
                                <gloss target="#t_USSR1">USSR</gloss> by Communist <pb n="476"
                                xml:id="pg_476" facs="0504"/>China. The Communists also know that
                            overt aggression on their part in Korea could lead to all-out war.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that in
                            our judgment a reduction of the Korean Army by four divisions would not
                            make the difference between attacking and not attacking on the part of
                            the Communists in Korea. He further pointed out that the modernization
                            of United States forces is a compensating factor for these reductions.
                            In addition, the savings which would be derived from the reduction of
                            four divisions would be good for the Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> expressed the view
                            that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would be
                            willing to go along with a cut in the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces if the remainder were modernized in a manner
                            similar to that now being undertaken for United States forces. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that the
                            United States Government is not going to reorganize the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army into pentomic divisions. This is
                            being done for no country in the world. However, there will be some
                            modernization of the Korean forces leading to the introduction of much
                            better equipment.</p>
                        <p>At this point Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            referred to a statement attributed to Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> to the effect that Defense
                            officials had promised to modernize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces with nuclear weapons following the completion of
                            this action for United States forces.<note n="3" xml:id="d235fn3">See

                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> pointed out that
                            this is not the United States policy. Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> denied making any such
                            statement.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that
                            although we were not doing the same for other military forces the type
                            of modernization being undertaken for our own is absolutely essential.
                            Our forces are smaller in numbers in relation to the size and population
                            of the country. Therefore, it is essential that they be the strongest
                            possible.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphasized that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> must realize that
                            our actions and recommendations with respect to the forces in Korea will
                            have the effect of strengthening the defensive position there. Reduction
                            in force levels without weakening the military position, however, will
                            have beneficial effects in the Korean economy.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> commented that the
                            Koreans do not want to be caught holding obsolete equipment,
                            particularly when the Communists in the north are well-equipped. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that the
                            Korean forces will get much better equipment but we can not do the same
                            as we are doing for the United States forces there.</p>
                        <p>Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_YD1">Yang</persName> then asked about
                            the prospects for civilian aid. He added that it is impossible for Korea
                            to take such aid on a loan basis. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> commented that the economic aid is before the
                            Congress and we may well have a cut in that, too. With regard to the
                            question of loans, he explained that he has often pointed out <pb
                                n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0505"/>Korea’s inability to repay

                            basis, we will have to work out soft terms in recognition of Korea’s
                            absence of repayment capability.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: Thank you for your letter
                            of July 19<note n="2" xml:id="d238fn2"><ref target="#d231">Document
                                    231</ref>.</note> which I received this week through Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>.</p>
                        <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0507"/>
                        <p>While I am aware that there are economic considerations that make a
                            reduction in our armed forces desirable, I seriously question the wisdom
                            of doing so at this time.</p>
                        <p>Before reaching this conclusion, I called in our Chiefs of Staff, quietly
                            and separately, and they are agreed on the following points:</p>
                        <p>First, we do not know what modern weapons are coming, nor how many, nor
                            when. Until we have this information, we cannot evaluate the
                            implications of a reduction in our armed forces.</p>
                        <p>Second, we do not know whether the modernization program will apply
                            equally to the United States Forces in Korea and to the Korean Forces.
                            We have heard that the United States contemplates modernizing only one
                            or more United States Divisions in Korea. Our people are reluctant to
                            believe that the United States will equip only American troops with
                            modern weapons while the troops of her allies in Korea will continue to
                            have obsolete and outmoded weapons and equipment. We have been fighting
                            shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy who is bent upon our
                            destruction and if the United States were now to discriminate in the
                            matter of armaments, please think of the adverse effect it would have,
                            both militarily and psychologically.</p>
                        <p>It is a tragedy indeed when Asian people and countries turn against
                            America. This must not happen in Korea where the friendly sentiment of
                            the people of America provides one of the strongest bulwarks against the
                            further spread of Communism.</p>
                        <p>With reference to the Mutual Defense Treaty between our two countries, we
                            are forever grateful for this assurance that America will come to our
                            aid when aggression threatens us. The Communist Chinese are an
                            increasing menace to our security and as long as they are in ruthless
                            control of the northern half of our country we cannot attain a unified,
                            free and independent country which is the goal the United Nations has
                            accepted for Korea.</p>
                        <p>Added to these concerns is our mounting fear of renewed Japanese
                            expansion. We have reported to you and to your Secretary of State that
                            Japan claims that 85% of the property of Korea belongs to the Japanese.
                            Thus far the United States has done nothing to make the Japanese
                            withdraw this preposterous claim though it is a flagrant violation of
                            the terms of the Peace Treaty.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, encouragement is being given to Japan’s ambitions to have
                            hegemony of all of Asia, and the Japanese are becoming more and more
                            confident that they will once again gain control of other countries in
                            the Pacific area and America’s leadership of free Asia will be lost.</p>
                        <p>The consequences would be disastrous for us. Under America’s leadership
                            and with the help and support of the American people, our people have
                            been able to face these past years of trial and stress <pb n="480"
                                xml:id="pg_480" facs="0508"/>with a growing determination to resist
                            aggression and keep their hard-won freedom. They are aware, as you and I
                            are, that the dangers to their security have not lessened, and they know
                            that to deter our enemies Korea must be militarily and economically
                            strong.</p>
                        <p>If we remain firm in our resolve to guard against renewed aggression and
                            unify Korea, I am confident we will succeed, and the victory will be a
                            victory for all the free nations of the world as well as for your
                            country and mine.</p>

                                the Secretary of Defense, dated August 6. The memorandum by the
                                Joint Chiefs contained their views on the proposed revisions of
                                paragraph 9 of <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1. As noted
                                in <ref target="#d239fn4">footnote 4</ref> above, the change which
                                they proposed in subparagraph 9a was incorporated in the policy
                                statement as finally adopted by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss>. The other change they proposed, which was to

                                reduce it to a simple statement reading “Equip U.S. forces in Korea
                                with modern weapons,” was not adopted by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                    >NSC</gloss>. The Joint Chiefs felt that the remainder of the

                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then pointed out that
                            the Joint Chiefs of Staff wished to delete, in subparagraph 9–c, the
                            limitations therein on the deployment to Korea [<hi rend="italic">1 line
                                of source text not declassified</hi>]. Instead of the version of
                            subparagraph 9–c proposed by the Planning Board, the Joint Chiefs had
                            asked for language to indicate that the Secretary of Defense should seek
                            the concurrence of the Secretary of State and obtain early Presidential
                            approval for the immediate introduction into Korea of weapons possessing
                            an atomic delivery capability [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of
                                source text not declassified</hi>].</p>
                        <p>The President inquired whether the older version of these subparagraphs
                                (<gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1, considered by the
                            Council in March) did not state that the timing of the deployment of
                            such weapons to Korea would be determined by the President. As the
                            President recalled it, the reason for this was our great political need
                            to find out the reaction of our friends and allies to the announcement
                            that we were proposing to modernize U.S. forces in Korea despite Article
                            13(d).</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> called on Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, but Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> interrupted to state
                            that it might be helpful to Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName> if he, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1"
                                >Wilson</persName>, first talked for a moment about the Defense
                            Department position on this issue. He said that his own personal
                            position differed a little from that of many of his colleagues in the
                            Defense Department. While he was quite aware of the military needs for
                            modernizing U.S. forces in Korea, he was also keenly aware of the
                            political and psychological aspects of the problem. Above all, he wished
                            to avoid “heating up” the difficulties in Korea any more than could be
                            helped, and he was also very concerned about the problem of the costs of
                            modernization. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>
                            added that he had, however, received a report from his people only
                            yesterday, stating that if the package deal proposed in <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> 5702/1 were adopted, we would be able
                            to bring home approximately 8000 American military personnel, and we
                            could cut out four active South Korean divisions, which would save us
                            approximately $25 million a year. If such savings could be made,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> believed it
                            would be worth while [<hi rend="italic">1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] to modernize U.S. forces there.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then took the
                            floor, and stated that the general proposal to countermand the
                            provisions of Article 13(d) of the Armistice Agreement had been pretty
                            well received throughout the Free World. The reason for this favorable
                            reaction to our announcement was that our course of action had been
                            carefully planned and carefully worked out with our allies. [<hi

                        <p>His second point, continued Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>, was that this whole modernization plan was a
                            package deal involving a reduction in the force levels of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> insisted that the United States
                            was not in a position to sustain the costs of supporting the present
                            level of the South Korean forces to the tune of over $700 million a
                            year. Congress was going to insist on a very sharp cut in our military
                            assistance and defense support programs world-wide. If we continue to
                            try to support the present high levels of the indigenous forces in
                            Korea, we will find ourselves obliged to make drastic reductions in our
                            military aid programs in other parts of the world. Yet, there was so far
                            no evidence whatsoever that we were going to succeed in getting South
                            Korea to agree to a cut in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force
                            levels. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was, as
                            usual, being stubborn and tough in these negotiations. Therefore,
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> did not think
                            that it was wise to introduce at this time into Korea weapons [<hi

                            280 mm. cannon—which are primarily psychological in their impact and
                            designed to impress upon the South Koreans the fact that we have really
                            modernized our U.S. forces there.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> said that the
                            previous argument had been that if our U.S. forces were given such [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> would be induced to agree
                            to reducing the active divisions of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> armed forces. On the other hand, if <persName

                            such weapons should be determined, as suggested in the proposed
                            subparagraph 9–c, by the President in consultation with the Secretaries
                            of State and Defense. The decision would depend primarily on the
                            attitude shown by <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> in
                            negotiations with our people, and on his willingness to reduce South
                            Korean force levels.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> indicated his agreement
                            with the Secretary of State’s position, and said that that was why the
                            Planning Board had drafted subparagraph 9–c in its present form. He then
                            suggested that <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>
                            speak to the Council regarding his recent negotiations with President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> indicated that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had been very
                            pleased indeed with our decision to suspend Article 13(d) of the
                            Armistice Agreement and to proceed to modernize U.S. forces in Korea.
                            However, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> indicated
                            that he wanted more information on the precise character of the
                            modernization of forces which we contemplated and, particularly, what we
                            had in mind with respect to the modernization of the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Army. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >General Lemnitzer</persName> and Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName>, following their instructions
                            from Washington, had explained as best they could what we had in mind by
                            way of modernization, <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0512"/>but, of
                            course, could not, in accordance with instructions from Washington, make
                            any mention of the 280 mm. cannon or the Honest John rockets.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said that
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> seemed honestly
                            anxious to be sure that the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> retained
                            sufficient military power to resist any renewed Communist aggression
                            from the north. Accordingly, <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> had come up with the suggestion for a joint
                            study by U.S. and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military personnel
                            as to possible reduction in the level of <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces in the light of the modernization of U.S. forces
                            in Korea. Actually, continued <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName>, if you look at the current situation candidly,
                            we are not really modernizing our U.S. forces in Korea as long as the
                            restrictions against the Honest John rockets and the 280 mm. cannon
                            remain in force. Or, at any rate, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> authorities do not really believe we are modernizing
                            our forces when they fail to see these atomic-capable weapons. Moreover,
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> felt that
                            he must point out that the Honest John rocket and the 280 mm. cannon
                            were not weapons designed to produce a psychological impact. They
                            constitute valuable defensive weapons and will add greatly to our
                            military strength in Korea. Finally, if Communist aggression should
                            recur in Korea, we would find it very difficult to explain to the
                            American people why we had not provided our forces in Korea with the
                            most modern and efficient weapons in our possession.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> took exception to
                            these last remarks of <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName>, and said that it was his understanding that
                            the Council had been shown a rather lengthy list of modern weapons which
                            were to be supplied to our forces in Korea, and that of this long list
                            the State Department had taken exception to the deployment of only two
                            types—namely, the Honest John rocket and the 280 mm. cannon. <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> replied that he did
                            not deny the accuracy of Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1"
                                >Dulles</persName>’ statement, but said that the other modern
                            weapons were really not very significant as compared to the Honest John
                            rocket and the 280 mm. cannon. These were the two big weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> replied that if
                            this were the case, he still could not see why we should now play our
                            trump card—that is, these two big weapons—until President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had agreed to reduce the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels in exchange for the
                            deployment of these atomic-capable weapons.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> intervened to
                            point out that the deployment of the Honest John rockets and the 280 mm.
                            cannon was particularly designed to bar the invasion route from North
                            Korea into South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that it seemed to
                            him that subparagraph 9–c, as proposed by the Planning Board, was
                            admirably designed to settle this question. The President disagreed with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName>, and pointed <pb
                                n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0513"/>out that <persName
                                corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> was bringing up a
                            different argument— namely, that our U.S. divisions in Korea ought to
                            have the Honest John rockets and the 280 mm. cannon as basic weapons.
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, on the other
                            hand, was arguing that we should not introduce these weapons into South
                            Korea until President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had
                            agreed to reduce <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels. In
                            any event, continued the President, we ought now to be in a position to
                            go to <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> and state that if he
                            will agree to certain reductions in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            force levels, we in turn will agree to modernize our U.S. forces in
                            Korea with Honest John rockets and the 280 mm. cannon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> commented that this
                            proposal of the President’s was likewise in accordance with the proposed
                            subparagraph 9–c.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> then pointed out
                            that as yet [1 line of source text not declassified]. The President
                            expressed surprise, and said that he thought this proposal had been
                            agreed to when the National Security Council last discussed the Korean
                            policy paper. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> remarked
                            that [2 lines of source text not declassified]. As he understood it,
                            this matter would be handled elsewhere.<note n="6" xml:id="d239fn6"

                        <p>At this point, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            read portions of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s
                            recent letter to President Eisenhower<note n="7" xml:id="d239fn7"><hi
                                    rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note>—portions which indicated
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s concern that the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces should be modernized as well as
                            the U.S. forces. Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>
                            warned that it was going to cost an awful lot of money if the United
                            States found itself obliged to modernize both the South Korean and the
                            U.S. divisions in Korea. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral
                                Radford</persName> pointed out that at least we could pass on some
                            of our older equipment to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            divisions as the U.S. forces are progressively modernized with new
                            weapons. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> also
                            pointed out that the process of modernizing U.S. forces would carry over
                            a considerable period of time.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> expressed some
                            frank and unflattering views of President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>. President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> appeared to him as essentially an Oriental
                            bargainer. In the best of circumstances it was going to be very hard to
                            get him to agree to a reduction of the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces. Indeed, to achieve this we may have to give him
                            a heavy jolt, because he is a master of evasion.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> suggested that
                            the best way to provide a jolt for President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> would be to hold back U.S. funds.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> said that it seemed to
                            him that <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName>
                            believed that if, in the course of further negotiations, we could
                            mention the Honest John rockets and the 280 mm. cannon, we could
                            probably bring <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> to accept the
                            desired reduction in <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> force levels.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> confirmed
                            this view.</p>
                        <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0514"/>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> then inquired
                            whether it would not be wise to send some kind of communication to our
                            people in Korea after the conclusion of this meeting. The President said
                            that it would be very hard to get all the nuances expressed in a single
                            statement, but suggested that the Secretaries of State and Defense try
                            to formulate a statement and perhaps send qualified personnel to take
                            the statement to Korea.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> once again
                            stressed the fact that one of the major purposes of modernizing U.S.
                            forces in Korea [<hi rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not
                                declassified</hi>] was to safeguard the security of our forces
                            there.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then went on to say that
                            the remaining revised paragraphs proposed by the <gloss target="#t_NSC1"
                                >NSC</gloss> Planning Board—namely, paragraphs 10 and 19—were not
                            very controversial. He read subparagraph 10–a, as follows: <quote

                                    (by at least four active divisions at this time, with no

                        <p>The President said he approved of this version of subparagraph 10–a, and
                            stated that we must now be in a position to inform President <persName

                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName> said that with

                            agree that there could be no increase in reserve <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> divisions to compensate for the reduction of four
                            active <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> divisions. After all, said
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>, it was much
                            less expensive to support reserve divisions than active divisions.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> pointed out
                            that Secretary <persName corresp="#p_WCE1">Wilson</persName>’s view did
                            not conform entirely to the views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. When the
                            Joint Chiefs had looked into the matter, they had found that the cost of
                            maintaining reserve divisions was still very high.</p>
                        <p>The President suggested that the language should not be made too
                            restrictive, and that leeway should be given to our people who were
                            negotiating with <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then suggested that the
                            word “minimum” should be substituted for the word “no” in the third line
                            of subparagraph 10–a.</p>
                        <p>In a philosophical vein, the President observed that when you look at
                            this little finger of South Korea sticking out of mainland Asia, you
                            recall that the statement made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff <pb n="487"

                            as true today as it was then—namely, the statement that while Korea is
                            of no military importance to us in general war, it is psychologically
                            and politically of such importance that to lose it would run the risk of
                            the loss of our entire position in the Far East. Accordingly, we have
                            got to carry on in South Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_CR1">Cutler</persName> then pointed out that
                            there remained one more split in <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            5702/1 which should be resolved. This elated to paragraph 23, where a
                            course of action was set forth indicating what the United States should
                            do or consider doing if, despite the actions taken under Annex F,<note

                            forces should renew hostilities unilaterally. The State Department
                            wished to insert the term that the United States should “consider” these
                            further courses of action; the majority of the Planning Board was of the
                            opinion that, after all the prior steps the United States would have
                            taken to prevent the renewal of hostilities unilaterally by the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>, we would not merely “consider” these
                            additional courses of action, but would proceed to take them at
                            once.</p>
                        <p>Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> stated that this
                            difference of opinion brought to mind a saying frequently used by the
                            President, to the effect that “Planning is essential, though the plans
                            themselves may not be important.” If war were to start again in Korea,
                            said Secretary <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName>, it was
                            going to be very hard indeed to determine which side had begun the war.
                            Accordingly, while it was desirable to have all these plans of action in
                            mind, it was not going to be easy to determine now, in advance of the
                            event, precisely what courses of action would be mandatory on the United
                            States.</p>
                        <p>The President commented that the best thing to insert here was what the
                            French had said to the Russians at the outbreak of war in 1914, that is:
                            “France will do whatever is in its own best interests.”</p>

                            <p>3. To achieve both the long-range and current objectives through
                                peaceful means, if possible to do so without compromising U.S.
                                obligations, principles, or military security.</p>
                            <p rend="center">Major Policy Guidance</p>
                            <p>4. There is little prospect of Communist agreement on any reasonable
                                formula for establishment of a unified democratic Korean state; but
                                short of unification on terms of a character which the United States
                                has advocated, there can be no settlement of the tensions in the
                                Korean area.</p>
                            <p>5. U.S. interests are deeply involved in Korea. Unless the United
                                States continues to provide strong political, military and economic
                                support to the Republic of Korea, the Communist bloc probably will
                                ultimately succeed in extending its control over the whole of Korea.
                                Such a development would undermine Free World security in the
                                Northeast Asia area, and (because of the symbolic importance of
                                Korea with respect to alliances and collective security) would be
                                seriously detrimental to U.S. policy of supporting peace and justice
                                through the United Nations and to the general struggle against
                                Communism throughout the Far East.</p>
                            <p>6. In the light of the above, U.S. objectives should also take into
                                account the importance of reducing Korean dependence on U.S.
                                assistance and making greater progress toward the ultimate goal of a
                                self-supporting economy.</p>
                            <p>7. The United Nations’ role with respect to Korea is an asset in the
                                struggle against Communism. The <gloss target="#t_UN1">UN</gloss>
                                provided the principal legal basis for successful resistance against
                                Communist aggression. Initiatives have come from the United States,
                                but the general support of the United Nations and the allies of the
                                United States is of great psychological force, both with respect to
                                world opinion and the attitudes of the Republic of Korea.</p>

                            have no plans to introduce nuclear weapons at this time. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he felt there is no
                            obligation to go back to any of these representatives at this time since
                            our position had been made entirely clear. <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1"
                                >Admiral Radford</persName> said that he agreed and that the

                            August 8<note n="2" xml:id="d241fn2">See <ref target="#d239">Document

                            the United States forces to introduce modern weapons in Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that he thought
                            it would be a mistake to send someone out from Washington to discuss a
                            modernization program with President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> agreed and said that this would undermine our
                            officials on the spot.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> stated that he
                            understood Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> is
                            preparing a paper regarding negotiations with the Korean Government on
                            the subject of modernization. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> commented that we seem to be making
                            modernization of our forces in Korea contingent upon negotiations with
                            the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that he thought
                            the President had given clear authority to go ahead on the modernization
                            program for United States forces.</p>
                        <p><persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> said that we
                            are reorganizing our two divisions in Korea on a pentomic pattern with
                            the emphasis on the Honest John as the basic weapon. It is essential
                            that modern weapons be provided to maintain the strength of the
                            divisions. He said that President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> is worried about maintaining the strength of his
                            forces if their manpower is to be reduced. The United States has not
                            been able to satisfy President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> on this score. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> commented that we have a serious problem of
                            procedure in going <pb n="500" xml:id="pg_500" facs="0528"/>about the
                            modernization of our forces and keeping President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_MRD1">Murphy</persName> asked what we have
                            actually done so far on modernization. <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1"
                                >General Lemnitzer</persName> said that there have been some
                            overflights by modern aircraft and that this has been very helpful
                            although the Koreans well know that the planes are based in Japan and
                            not in Korea. Some other new equipment is going into our forces in Korea
                            but this has not been particularly impressive. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> noted that the
                            airfields in Korea are not adequate and that there is only one good one.
                            He said that it is important to rotate air groups into Korea for
                            familiarization and also that all-weather aircraft should be brought in.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> said that
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> is working on a paper
                            regarding modernization and that for this purpose the programs of the
                            three services must be reviewed. The Admiral expressed the view that we
                            must do a little more to modernize the Korean forces. He noted that if
                            our own two divisions should be over-run in case of attack, the
                            resulting impression would be most unfavorable. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that the presence
                            of substantial numbers of Americans is also very desirable as a form of
                            check on the Koreans.</p>
                        <p>Both Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RAAW1">Admiral Radford</persName> noted that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> is dissatisfied with the
                            retaliation argument: he thinks it will do his country little good to
                            have retaliation by the United States if a hostile attack has already
                            over-run the nation.</p>

                        <p>Reference paragraph 3a., Minister advised that total US support
                            appropriated for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> would not be known
                            here for some time, possibly not before December. Further advised that
                            present indications are that appropriations will be less than <gloss
                                target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1957.</p>
                        <p>Part five.</p>
                        <p>Reference paragraph 3b., Minister informed additional equipment for
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces including additional
                            fighter bomber wing and improved communication and transportation
                            equipment contingent upon reduction of present <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces. Minister asked specifically about more modern
                            tanks, additional 105 and 155 howitzers to provide six gun batteries and
                            additional <gloss target="#t_AAA1">AAA</gloss> (sky-sweeper and radar).
                            He was informed these not presently programmed but would be considered
                            in development of future programs.</p>
                        <p>Part six.</p>
                        <p>Reference paragraph 3c, Minister advised minimum reduction must be four
                            active divisions by end of US <gloss target="#t_FY1">FY</gloss> 1958;
                            that reduction should start promptly; that US not thinking in terms of
                            specific cost or numbers of personnel, but in terms of units. Minister
                            stated that politically he did not feel country or President would
                            accept reduction of four divisions as such. He stated his current
                            thinking was the elimination of battalions and batteries from regimental
                            and battalion size units to effect reduction equivalent to four
                            divisions. He feels that psychologically this would be best approach and
                            would facilitate more rapid reattainment of combat effectiveness.
                            Minister was advised that such a reduction would entail greater
                            reduction in personnel than would outright reduction of four divisions
                            and would require <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0530"/>storage of
                            individual and unit equipment so as to be immediately available to
                            reserve unit earmarked to replace eliminated unit on M-day. With
                            reference to increased pay and allowances for <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces, Minister was informed that the need for more
                            adequate pay for <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> military was
                            recognized but could not possibly be provided for present strength.
                            Further, that the overall cost of support to <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> forces and <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy
                            was constantly rising, therefore, budget for <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1957 could not necessarily be used as basis upon which
                            he could assume an actual saving would result in <gloss target="#t_FY1"
                                >FY</gloss> 1958. Minister advised that present <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> economy cannot support current <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces on a sound financial basis and
                            that it is important that more funds be directed to capital investment
                            in the national economy to provide a sound structure for support of
                            military forces.</p>
                        <p>Part seven.</p>
                        <p>Reference 3d., Minister concerned that reduction of forces might be
                            construed to mean decreased effort by <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> and would result in reduction of US financial support.
                            Minister advised this was not the case, that reductions in financial
                            support must be expected but these are worldwide, that US fully aware
                            importance Korea.</p>
                        <p>Part eight.</p>
                        <p>Minister also expressed concern that in event of general war, US might
                            withdraw forces from Korea leaving <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            alone; this would leave <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> incapable of
                            defense if forces were reduced.</p>
                        <p>Part nine.</p>
                        <p>The matter of equipping <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces with
                            atomic capable weapons was not mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Part ten.</p>
                        <p>Upon conclusion, Minister <persName>Kim</persName> suggested subsequent
                            meeting. This was concurred in and it was recommended to the Minister
                            that at that time he be prepared to submit specific proposals of <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> courses of action. Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName> agreed to this and stated he would advise
                            when he was prepared for the next meeting. Since it is believed
                            Minister’s proposal will be along line indicated in paragraph 6, would
                            appreciate advice of acceptability of this approach. Ambassador and
                                <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> believe it has greater
                            chance of acceptance by President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>. <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>

                        <p>My letter of July 19<note n="3" xml:id="d243fn3"><ref target="#d231"
                                    >Document 231</ref>.</note> outlined the position we have taken
                            with respect to the necessity for bringing about a reduction in Republic
                            of Korea ground forces. This matter was given careful and thoughtful
                            consideration by our Government and all factors were taken into account.
                            The plan which resulted, and which Ambassador <persName
                                corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGGH1">General Decker</persName> have been discussing
                            with you and representatives of your Government, was developed by the
                            Secretaries of State and Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It has
                            my full support and will, in our opinion, enhance rather than weaken the
                            future security of the Republic of Korea against renewal of Communist
                            aggression.</p>
                        <p>I sincerely trust that Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">General
                                Decker</persName>, acting within my instructions will shortly
                            succeed in working out with you and your military advisers an orderly
                            and planned reduction in Republic of Korea ground forces. This will
                            enable the remaining forces to take advantage of certain new equipment
                            available within the fiscal year 1958 Military Assistance Program. I
                            would be less than candid if I did not state to you frankly that it will
                            be impossible, because of United States budgetary considerations, to
                            maintain the Korean aid program at present levels. Accordingly, failure
                            to reduce the level of Republic of Korea ground forces at this time
                            would not only result in a serious weakening of their defensive
                            capabilities because of equipment deficiencies, but would also throw an
                            increasingly heavy burden on the Korean economy with attendant
                            inflationary pressures.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the two specific questions you raise as to the nature and
                            extent of modernization of the Republic of Korea and United States
                            forces, Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and

                            instructed to discuss this in more detail with you.</p>
                        <p>May I take this opportunity to reaffirm United States interest in and
                            support of the Republic of Korea, its military security, economic
                            development and eventual peaceful reunification.</p>

                            Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> returned from Chinhae on
                            Monday and I had a long talk with him on Tuesday. He had obviously
                            benefited from his unusually long holiday and was more alert and less
                            nervous than when he left Seoul a few weeks ago. I was sorry to see,
                            however, that the rest this time had not done him as much good as had
                            previous vacations at Chinhae; he is beginning to look and act like a
                            very old man.</p>
                        <p>The talk covered a variety of subjects and as we were leaving President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> asked the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs, who was also present, if he could make some notes on
                            the conversation since there were a number of things he would like to
                            keep in mind. The Minister, appearing undecided as to whether to faint
                            or run from the room, promised that he would. In the entry, as we were
                            leaving the Kyung Mu Dai,<note n="2" xml:id="d244fn2">The Presidential

                                printed, indicated that the conversation dealt with impending visits
                                to Korea by prominent Americans, the question of Korean unification,
                                Korean-Japanese relations, the forthcoming visit to Korea by

                                of the armed forces of the Republic of Korea. On the question of the
                                reduction of Korean force levels, <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                    >Dowling</persName>’s notes indicated that he delivered

                                    >Rhee</persName> (<hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>), and pointed out
                                that the United States was prepared to supply an additional jet
                                fighter-bomber wing to the Republic of Korea, plus transport and
                                communications equipment, if an agreement could be reached on a
                                reduction in manpower. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                                responded by asking for more precise information regarding this
                                offer. <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> indicated that
                                he would consult with <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">General

                            forces, about which I reported in my telegram 204,<note n="5"

                                    <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> reported on the
                                delivery of President Eisenhower’s August 24 letter to President
                                    <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>. His report was very
                                similar to, and apparently based on, the notes outlined in <ref

                                in telegram 204 was that he felt that <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                    >Rhee</persName> now realized, for the first time, the nature of
                                the steps which the United States was prepared to take to modernize
                                the South Korean armed forces if an agreement could be reached on
                                manpower reduction. (Department of State, Central Files,
                                111.11–EI/9– 357)</note> and the question of Korean-Japanese
                            relations. I have had a subsequent conversation with the Minister of
                            Foreign Affairs on this latter subject and am endeavoring to try to
                            straighten things out. It seems to me that the problem is composed of
                            about equal parts of suspicion of Japanese motives and of ineptitude on
                            the part of the Minister. The solution, I think, is to find some new
                            wording which will enable him to save face and at the same time not give
                            away the fundamental position of the Koreans, i.e., that they shall have
                            an opportunity to raise their claims at the proposed formal conference
                            with hopes of some success. The question remains whether, as the
                            Berliners say, “the situation is desperate, but not hopeless,” or
                            “hopeless but not desperate,” as the Viennese used to put it.</p>
                        <p>I shall write you further about this when I have had a chance to talk to
                            the Minister again.</p>

                            is the agenda of a State–Defense meeting in Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>’ office, attended by Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and at which <pb
                                n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0534"/>I represented <gloss
                                target="#t_FE1">FE</gloss>. I believe a summary of some of the
                            points discussed under agenda items 1 and 2 will be of particular
                            interest to you. [Here follows discussion of agenda item I.]</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Agenda Item II.</hi></p>
                        <p>Defense had prepared a draft joint State–Defense message to Ambassador
                                <persName corresp="#p_DWC1">Dowling</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGGH1">General Decker</persName> which was brought up
                            for discussion (Tab C).<note n="3" xml:id="d245fn3">Not found attached;
                                for the message as sent, see <ref target="#d247">Document
                                247</ref>.</note> The Secretary pointed out, “We are honor bound to
                            keep two divisions in Korea if we make this deal with <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>.” Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> agreed but observed that
                            changing conditions might justify an alteration in our plans and he said
                            that two divisions would certainly be retained in Korea long enough to
                            fulfill our bargain. Then he added: “As long as the situation continues
                            as it does today, we have just got to keep this kind of force in
                            Korea.”</p>
                        <p>The Secretary then inquired as to whether two more divisions must come
                            out of Europe and Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                                >Quarles</persName> replied in the affirmative.</p>
                        <p>Turning to the cable itself, the Secretary thought we should have some
                            caveats in the instruction and that we would have to be more precise on
                            details of modernization of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces.
                            He read the attached cable from <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName> (Tab D)<note n="4" xml:id="d245fn4">Not found
                                attached; apparent reference to a cabled copy of <ref target="#d238"
                                    >Document 238</ref>.</note> which I had given him to emphasize
                            the point. He then called upon me for any observations I had in
                            connection with paragraph 3 sub-section (1).</p>
                        <p>I pointed out that we would be faced with two problems which related to
                            timing: (1) Since the proposed action could not be kept secret, it was
                            certain that there would be a thorough airing in the General Assembly of
                            the subject in connection with the discussion of our action under
                            Paragraph 13 (d) of the Armistice Agreement; and (2) that we might have
                            an implied obligation to inform the Sixteen Nations. I understood that
                            Secretary <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had shown a
                            list of equipment to representatives of the seven nations which still
                            have military forces in Korea but the remainder of the Sixteen Nations
                            were under the impression that no primary atomic weapons were to be
                            introduced into Korea. I observed that the Dutch had raised this
                            question specifically and had been informed that only dual purpose
                            weapons would be introduced for the time being, and that the Dutch had
                            subsequently asked to be consulted before any further steps were
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary raised the question as to how soon it was planned to move
                            these weapons into Korea and presumed that it would take several months.
                                <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General Lemnitzer</persName> answered
                            that we needed them <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0535"/>now, that
                            they were all ready for shipment and that it would be merely a matter of
                            weeks once the word was given.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary observed at a later stage in the meeting, in summarizing
                            State’s position, that the point regarding the debate in the General
                            Assembly did not bother him too much, and that as regards the Sixteen
                            Nations, he turned to me and suggested that we talk with the Dutch.</p>
                        <p>During the discussion, Secretary <persName corresp="#p_QDA1"
                                >Quarles</persName> said the Army feels that <persName
                                corresp="#p_DGGH1">General Decker</persName> should have the
                            latitude of going beyond the current <gloss target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss>
                            policy in the direction of modernization. [<hi rend="italic">1-1/2 lines
                                of source text not declassified</hi>]</p>
                        <p>The Secretary queried if we charged the surplus stock which would be
                            transferred to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces to the
                            Military Security program, what would the cost be? Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> reply was that it would amount
                            to $100 million for the first year. He said the total savings as a
                            result of modernization of our own forces would be $60 million during
                            the same period. He further noted that these savings would be wiped out
                            if <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">General Decker</persName> had to
                            modernize the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces further but he
                            added that this, of course, would require additional <gloss
                                target="#t_NSC1">NSC</gloss> approval.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary also raised the question as to what we were now planning to
                            supply Koreans by way of modern weapons. He failed to get a clear answer
                            to this question but <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> pointed out that the Koreans were anxious to
                            have M 46 tanks some of which would be surplus to our two divisions, and
                            they want recoilless rifles. If we could supply them with these two
                            items, it would go a long way toward meeting their urge for
                            modernization, he said. Modernization in communications and
                            transportation is a weak reed to lean on in selling <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> the idea of reducing his forces, he
                            emphasized. The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> knows that this is
                            already programmed. I asked <persName corresp="#p_LGLL1">General
                                Lemnitzer</persName> how many tanks presumably could be supplied as
                            surplus from two modernized U.S. Divisions. He said it would probably
                            run in the neighborhood of 50. The recoilless rifles would not come out
                            of surplus.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary finally agreed to go along in general with the draft joint
                            cable but said he thought it should be more responsive to President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>’s request for details.
                            The paragraph on equipment should be expanded and there should be a
                            general caveat which would take us off the hook if subsequently we found
                            it necessary to pull out some of our troops. The Secretary then observed
                            that we have just got to go ahead with this program of reduction of
                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. “We are not going to get
                            the kind of money that will enable us to spend around a billion dollars
                            a year in Korea”, he concluded.</p>

                                    that the Department of Defense had revised the language of the

                                    clear the cable “on assumption that ’surplus’ to <gloss

                                corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName>, he, M., had a further
                            discussion with <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> and was
                            told that this pricing is a standard formula. Sec said he did not intend
                            to accuse <persName corresp="#p_QDA1">Quarles</persName> of trickery,
                            but he was interested in knowing what it would cost. Sec said the
                            purpose of the Korea program was to cut down the charge against our
                            mutual security program. Sec said naturally Defense would prefer to turn
                            over equipment to Korea and get money for it than leave it sitting in
                            warehouses. Sec. said perhaps amount could be cut from 50 million to 25
                            million; 50 million was quite a bit of money for Korea. M. said 50
                            million was not a firm figure, there were two items in it which might
                            well be reduced. Sec said he was interested in knowing what the impact
                            would be on other aspects of our military assistance budget, to <gloss
                                target="#t_NATO1">NATO</gloss> for example. Sec said you could not
                            deal with one aspect without regard for the other; does our budget take
                            account of <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0537"/>this. M. said

                            office said they can absorb it without damage to other programs. Sec
                            said they had claimed the cut itself would damage the program, and now
                            they say they could take another 50 million. M. said what he wished to
                            emphasize was that this was not an arbitrary price. He said he thought
                            that was what the Sec had been concerned about. Sec said what he was
                            concerned about was that he had been told that in view of the
                            Congressional cut in military assistance program there would be an
                            impact on our ability to modernize <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, is this still further hitting it and which is more
                            important? M. said Barnes said not, but he would look into it further.
                            Sec wondered whether Bureau of Budget had anything to say. M. said he
                            had not touched base with them and should he. Sec said no. Sec said if
                            people familiar with the impact on <gloss target="#t_NATO1"
                            >NATO</gloss>, Vietnam, etc., think this is all right, it was all right
                            with him. M. said he would be assured that it was cut down to the very
                            minimum.</p>

                            on President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> found him
                            reasonably alert and generally agreeable frame of mind. During dinner
                            with him in evening found him quite apathetic with mind apparently
                            wandering from time to time. I am told this situation becoming more
                            acute and all official appointments with <persName corresp="#p_RS1"

                            which Ambassador had arranged for us provided most interesting
                            conversation. Vice President extremely outspoken in his criticism of
                            present government basing criticisms on three major points: (1)
                            Dictatorial form of government; (2) Greatly excessive number of local
                            police who being used essentially for political purposes and to
                            intimidate population; (3) Widespread corruption throughout government
                            due in part to gross under-payment government officials and army
                            personnel and in part to officials of party controlling not only
                            patronage but every type commercial licenses or opportunity for private
                            initiative. Vice President stated that to date his party had confined
                            itself to criticism specific acts of administration but had prepared
                            memorandum copy of which he gave to Ambassador and myself confidentially
                            outlining constructive program. This he expected to have approved by
                            party leadership and to publish in few days. Have made complete report

                            having <pb n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0540"/>to confess to Richards
                            that while I thought it would never happen I find myself in sympathy
                            with Democratic Party (Korean, of course). Vice President laid great
                            stress on corruption and gross irregularities in elections and feared
                            same would recur next May when elections for Assembly held unless
                            present Assembly, which apparently somewhat ashamed of boldness of
                            government practices, enacts safeguarding legislation.</p>
                        <p>Stay in Korea included visit to front and discussions with General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">Decker</persName>. Latter gives me
                            impression of being excellent officer with flexible mind and disposed
                            cooperate fully with Ambassador <persName corresp="#p_DWC1"
                                >Dowling</persName>. In general situation Seoul has many
                            characteristics situation Formosa with morale army still good, but real
                            danger deteriorating picture.</p>
                        <p>Question of reduction of forces discussed freely with Minister of
                            Defense, Ambassador and General <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1"
                                >Decker</persName>. Latter personally convinced 21 instead of
                            present 23 divisions essential for defense purposes but is now exploring
                            with Korean defense authorities possibly reducing size Korean divisions
                            rather than deactivating whole divisional units. Believe key to
                            situation lies in making available for American divisions some [<hi
                                rend="italic">less than 1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]
                            such as 280 mm. guns and Long <persName>John</persName> units on which
                            no decision yet reached in Washington.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps most discouraging part of picture is wastage American funds
                            because unrealistic exchange rate and widespread frittering away

                            of Democratic Party while they may not overturn government may well
                            force some necessary internal reforms. Strength Democratic Party not
                            great in National Assembly, but its importance evidenced by fact that
                            Municipal Council of Seoul has 40 Democratic members to 12 Liberals and
                            I am told proportion almost equally great Municipal Councils other

                            September 21, 1957. After expressing his appreciation for the
                            opportunity of meeting with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> before Mr. <persName>Warne</persName> returns
                            to Korea, Minister <persName>Kim</persName> said that President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> had been worrying greatly
                            about the possibility of cuts in United States aid for this year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that despite
                            all efforts to have Congress appropriate the full amount requested by
                            the Administration, an over-all cut of about 20% was made. Consequently
                            we must face this reality and adjust the various programs
                            accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> said that in the spring of this year
                            Mr. <persName>Warne</persName> and he developed a financial
                            stabilization program and that since then financial conditions in Korea
                            have been kept well under control. If there is a large cut in aid for
                            Korea this will hurt what has been done along stabilization lines. He
                            said further that Mr. <persName>Moyer</persName> of <gloss
                                target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss> had mentioned a figure of about $200
                            million for defense support. If this is the actual amount allocated,
                            Minister <persName>Kim</persName> said he does not see how Korea can
                            survive.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that he
                            considers the Korean program one of the most important that we have any
                            place in the world. We will do everything we can to make the largest
                            allocation possible for Korea but we do not know definitely what it will
                            be. There will be, however, a cut in the program and our problem is to
                            determine how we can adjust the program to the funds that are available.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> mentioned that Mr.
                                <persName>Warne</persName> is fully acquainted with the problem. <pb
                                n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0542"/>We have only so much money and
                            there will inevitably be a cut in the Korean program.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> said that speaking
                            unofficially he wished to point out that one way in which savings can be
                            made is by reduction in the number of men in the Korean military forces.
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> explained that he
                            did not mean that we should reduce our combined military strength in
                            Korea. However, we may be able to make a reduction in personnel and at
                            the same time show President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            that we are not decreasing over-all military strength. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> emphasized that he was not
                            saying this officially but merely commenting unofficially on the
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> then asked if a reduction in funds
                            allocated for military purposes meant that economic aid could be
                            increased.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> replied that the
                            over-all cut means that there will be a reduction in both military and
                            economic aid. However, we have not made a definite decision on the
                            actual amounts that will be available for Korea. Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName> said that in 1957 Korea is receiving about
                            $300 million. They know that in 1958 there will be a cut but if the cut
                            is too large it will mean disaster for Korea.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that he
                            understood there was a large pipeline of aid goods for Korea. Mr.
                                <persName>Warne</persName> explained that there was approximately
                            $320 million including unexpended funds in the pipeline on June 30,
                            1957. At the present time there is a total of about $200 million in the
                            project sector. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            then said that the fact that there is a large pipeline will not effect
                            our allocation of aid for the Korean program this year. However, it is a
                            factor that may help in the present problem caused by reduced
                            appropriations.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> then turned to the <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program. He said that Korea was
                            asking for a total program of about $70 million but the figure now being
                            discussed in Washington is about $50 million. The question of whether
                            rice should be included in the program is now under discussion. His
                            Government would like to have rice excluded this year. However, if the
                            exclusion of rice would reduce the total amount of the <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program they would agree to have
                            rice included. Mr. <persName>Warne</persName> commented that Korea needs
                            the maximum possible <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program
                            this year. If the decision is to eliminate rice the total program should
                            not be reduced. The program can utilize rice but normally more barley
                            than rice can be obtained for the same amount of money. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> asked about the rice crop in
                            Korea. Minister <persName>Kim</persName> replied that they have a good
                            rice crop this year and are not in need of additional rice.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> then discussed briefly the uses of
                            local currency arising from the <gloss target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480
                            program. He pointed out that in the past 90% of such proceeds were
                            allocated for support of the Korean <pb n="515" xml:id="pg_515"
                                facs="0543"/>armed forces. If the Cooley amendment<note n="3"
                                xml:id="d249fn3">The Cooley amendment to the Agricultural Trade
                                Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (<gloss target="#t_PL1"
                                    >P.L.</gloss> 480) was introduced by Representative Harold D.
                                Cooley of North Carolina and adopted by Congress on August 13, 1957.
                                (71 Stat. 345) The amendment stipulated that up to 25 percent of the
                                total sales proceeds of Title I programs should be made available
                                for loans in local currency to foreign and U.S. private investors
                                through the Export-Import Bank. The law prohibited loans for the
                                manufacture of products to be exported to the United States in
                                competition with American products.</note> were to be applied to
                            Korea a deficit in the budget would result. The present budget has been
                            calculated on the assumption that 90% of the proceeds from a new <gloss
                                target="#t_PL1">P.L.</gloss> 480 program would be made available.
                            Consequently, the Minister said, the Cooley amendment should not be
                            applied to Korea at least for the present fiscal year.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName>Warne</persName> supported the position stated by Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName>. He stressed that Korea has been an
                            exceptional case all along and that we have a precedent already set for
                            treating Korea as a special case. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> indicated his agreement that Korea is
                            unique.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> then raised the subject of offshore
                            procurement. He said that since aid will be cut offshore procurement in
                            terms of dollars is needed for Korea. It is not possible for Korean
                            suppliers to bid in terms of hwan because such prices are not
                            competitive. Mr. <persName>Warne</persName> said that there is a
                            possibility of up to $30 million being spent in Korea on offshore
                            procurement. If this total were reached it would help to lessen the
                            effect of a reduction in aid. In response to Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>’s question as to whether he
                            had discussed these matters in <gloss target="#t_ICA1">ICA</gloss>, Mr.
                                <persName>Warne</persName> said that he intended to do so on Monday,
                            September 30. He had already discussed some of these questions with
                            officials in the Pentagon.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> commented that about
                            40% of the entire aid funds requested of Congress was for the Far
                            Eastern area and about 75% of the 40% was for Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.
                            It is in these three places that the Communists pose the greatest
                            threat. Our aid allocation indicates that we consider these three to be
                            the most important. Consequently, he wanted to assure Minister
                                <persName>Kim</persName> that what is finally allocated to Korea
                            will represent our best efforts to take care of the Korean program. It
                            is obvious, however, that we cannot cut other programs in order to
                            assure that there will be no reduction in aid for Korea.</p>
                        <p>Minister <persName>Kim</persName> expressed his appreciation for the
                            meeting and the party left at approximately 12 o’clock.</p>

                                n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0545"/>I am convinced Minister is
                            doing what he can to obtain President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s consent to reduction, and believe it wise
                            continue to leave matter in his hands for time being. He has expressed
                            appreciation for our patience with him, and has implied that if he is to
                            succeed he must “make haste slowly.”</p>
                        <p>Although, as Dept knows, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"
                                >Rhee</persName>’s reactions are sometimes unpredictable, and he is
                            frequently inclined to change his decisions, I am reasonably hopeful
                            that we can obtain a satisfactory agreement in course of next few weeks.
                            This will not, of course, provide for elimination of four divisions, but
                            will I believe ensure equivalent reduction in manpower, perhaps by
                            inactivation two divisions and certain other support units.</p>

                                >Rhee</persName> this morning to discuss <gloss target="#t_FY1"

                        <p>I told President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> I regretted
                            inability to inform him officially of aid program before he read it in
                            press (UP Washington despatch giving full details was received Seoul Oct
                            26), but that we wished review details with him and ministers. Warne
                            then ran through program as it now stands, and told President <persName

                        <p>In reply, President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> thanked
                            Warne and me for efforts made on aid program, expressed pro forma
                            gratitude for US assistance, although reduced this year, and then
                            launched into extremely bitter anti-American diatribe. He said Korea had
                            followed US lead faithfully and fully (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>),<note
                                n="3" xml:id="d252fn3">As on the source text.</note> but that he had
                            finally and reluctantly concluded US incapable or unwilling lead free
                            world. He described present US policy as “peace at any price,” alleged
                            US ignoring increasing Communist gains, and asserted all would be lost
                            unless Communists stopped immediately. He declared Korea could not exist
                            on US aid and vain hopes and said early reunification was required if
                            Korea is to survive. Instead, he said, US was concentrating on
                            co-existence <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0546"/>with Communists
                            and on assisting Japan to Asian dominance. Throughout his discourse
                            there ran vein of resentment at Washington for what he obviously sees as
                            neglect of Korea and disregard his own views.</p>
                        <p>I let President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> speak for some
                            thirty minutes without interrupting, having learned through experience
                            that it is fruitless to reason with him until he has completely
                            unburdened himself, and then began as best I could to refute his
                            assertions. I argued my confidence in US policy, and my personal feeling
                            that we were making progress, although slow, in free world’s struggle
                            against Communism; and assured him that his views were fully weighed by
                            US, but pointed to need to reconcile divergent views of our many friends
                            and allies. I agreed that US policy was based on desire for peace, but
                            only with justice, and endeavored demonstrate that war would not resolve
                            our problems, but rather place intolerable burden of reconstruction and
                            even survival on victorious free world. In conclusion, I argued
                            necessity for compromising allied views and maintaining common front,
                            and attempted return to subject at hand.</p>
                        <p>Although he had calmed down in course my remarks, it became obvious
                            President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> was uninterested in
                            any real discussion of aid program. He came back, in more sober manner,
                            to unification question, and asked what was to be done. I replied I
                            could not offer any single effective step, but said series of actions
                            taken and being taken would I thought be ultimately successful. On

                            My assessment is that he will “cool off” somewhat as his attention is
                            distracted by other matters. I do feel, however, that his attitude, as

                                reduction of South Korean ground forces should be accomplished by
                                selective reduction within the framework of existing military units
                                rather than by the elimination of four active divisions. Such a
                                reduction, they argued, would reduce the loss of combat forces,
                                would retain a framework for rapid expansion in an emergency, and
                                would be more acceptable to President <persName corresp="#p_RS1"

                        <p>On November 18, the First Committee of the U.N. General Assembly
                            completed 4 days of debate on “the Korean question” and drew up a report
                            for submission to the General Assembly. The debate was based in large
                            part upon the annual report of the U.N. Commission for the Unification
                            and Rehabilitation of Korea, submitted on August 14, and upon the August
                            9 report of the Unified Command dealing with the U.N. Command statement
                            in the Military Armistice Commission on June 21. (U.N. docs. A/3672 and
                            A/3631, respectively)</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia condemned the
                            decision of the Unified Command to introduce nuclear-capable weapons
                            into Korea, and United States representative Walter Judd responded that
                            the action taken by the Unified Command was merely “remedial action”
                            designed to offset Communist violations of the Armistice Agreement.

                            Resolution 1180(XII) which reaffirmed the U.N. objectives in Korea and
                            called upon the Communist authorities concerned to accept those
                            objectives in order to achieve a settlement in Korea based on the
                            fundamental principles for unification set forth by the nations

                            which the Koreans made to our proposals<note n="3" xml:id="d255fn3">See
                                    <ref target="#d247">Document 247</ref>.</note> on the reduction
                            of forces has not been accepted because of lack of clarification as to
                            actual numbers involved. The counter-proposal of the Koreans was that
                            they would reduce by two Divisions and the hitch lies in just what this
                            means. If it means what Manny hopes it means, namely, that two Divisions
                            of 15,000 men each are to be deactivated, plus one man in support of
                            each front-line Division man, there would be a total reduction of 60,000
                            individuals. Manny says that, should this understanding be confirmed, he
                            feels the Korean counter-proposals would be satisfactory, but they would
                            be unsatisfactory if the Koreans are merely talking about two front-line
                            Divisions. He hopes to have the picture clarified early next week and
                            will get in touch with <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter

                            latest figures available to us, of 669,300. In answer to our force
                            reduction proposals, the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> has
                            proposed force reductions of 60,000 men from the authorized 720,000
                            level, to consist of the deactivation of two army divisions and other

                            in an estimated saving of 3.5 billion hwan. The Korean Minister of
                            National Defense desires to utilize any funds saved by reductions for

                        <p>The <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> is obviously not prepared to

                            proposed by the U.S. It is not clear whether the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"
                                >ROK</gloss> counterproposal for the deactivation of two divisions
                            and other units, totalling 60,000 spaces, will result in dollar savings
                            equivalent to those anticipated from a four-division reduction. The
                            problem is further complicated by the <gloss target="#t_ROK1"

                            additional weapons and equipment, the cost of which is not known. We

                                as to the objective to be attained and the difficulty of explaining

                                <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> drafted plan.</p>
                        <p>On Monday, 25 November, a meeting with Assistant Secretary of State
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Walter Robertson</persName>, attended by
                            Mr. <persName>Irwin</persName>, Mr. <persName>Harr</persName>, Capt.
                                <persName>Robbins</persName>, and Mr. <persName>McCormick</persName>
                            of <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> and Mr.
                                <persName>Barbis</persName> of State, was held to discuss a draft
                            reply, prepared by <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>, which was a
                            response to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss>
                            counter-proposal.</p>
                        <p>This <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> draft rejected the <gloss
                                target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> reduction plan—which called for a
                            removal of 61,500 authorized <hi rend="italic">spaces,</hi> not actual
                                <hi rend="italic">personnel,</hi> from a base of 658,460 authorized
                            spaces (as opposed to an actual <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss>
                            strength of only 618,369)—because such a reduction did not meet the
                            requirements stipulated in cables 892 and 229. These two cables had
                            requested a reduction of four <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss>
                            active divisions with their supporting units or an equivalent reduction
                            in personnel. Further, the proposed <gloss target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss>
                            reply stated the modernization of U.S. forces in Korea was contingent
                            upon the reduction of <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> forces. Mr.
                                <persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> of State took issue
                            with this latter clause because seemingly it gave President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> a veto over modernization of our
                            forces. Consequently, the clause was deleted. Secretary <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> then agreed to review the
                            draft with Mr. <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and to
                            advise the Defense Department of State’s concurrence or
                            non-concurrence.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to this meeting, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName> of State and Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                                >Sprague</persName> of Defense discussed the text of the <gloss
                                target="#t_DOD1">DOD</gloss> draft. It now was Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s opinion, after a trip to
                            Korea, that a reduction of 4 division-slices in <gloss target="#t_ROKA1"
                                >ROKA</gloss> forces equated in the draft reply to a 100,000–120,000
                            men reduction, would not be negotiable; he suggested, <pb n="530"
                                xml:id="pg_530" facs="0558"/>rather, that perhaps a compromise
                            reduction of 61,500 troops from actual count rather than authorized
                            strength should be the new terms dispatched to the field for
                            presentation to the <gloss target="#t_ROK1">ROK</gloss> Government.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the <persName corresp="#p_SMD1"
                                >Sprague</persName>–<persName corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName>
                            discussion, State contacted Defense on 10 December, requesting our
                            participation in re-drafting the instructions to the field. Mr.
                                <persName>McCormick</persName> and Mr. <persName>Sweet</persName>,
                            both of the OSD/ISA Far East Region, represented Defense in this task.
                            The revised proposal, which expressed the mutually agreed views of
                            Secretaries <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName> and <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> (1) authorized the field to
                            tell President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> the Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and 280mm guns soon will be introduced
                            into Korea and (2) informed <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss>
                            and the Ambassador that the minimum acceptable plan is a reduction by 30
                            June 1958 of 61,500 men from <gloss target="#t_ROKA1">ROKA</gloss>
                            actual strength.</p>

                        <p>On the morning of 11 December, Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1">Howard
                                Parsons</persName> of State, North Asia, Far Eastern Affairs, called
                            Mr. <persName>McCormick</persName> to advise him that both Secretary
                                <persName corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RWS1">Robertson</persName> had concurred in the two
                            State–Defense working-group drafts outlined above and had hoped the
                            proposals would be dispatched promptly. Mr. <persName corresp="#p_PHL1"
                                >Parsons</persName> also agreed that Secretaries <persName
                                corresp="#p_DAW1">Dulles</persName> and <persName corresp="#p_RWS1"
                                >Robertson</persName>’s concurrence in these drafts, coupled with
                            Mr. <persName corresp="#p_SMD1">Sprague</persName>’s approval, gave
                            sufficient authority for <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> to
                            take immediate steps to effect introduction into Korea of the Honest
                                <persName>John</persName> and 280mm gun [<hi rend="italic">less than
                                1 line of source text not declassified</hi>]. Mr. <persName
                                corresp="#p_PHL1">Parsons</persName> further stated that action on
                            the introduction of these weapons is a matter of internal planning and
                            execution by <gloss target="#t_CINCUNC1">CINCUNC</gloss> and the

                        <p>Accordingly, two cables incorporating the State–Defense positions were

                                    presentation to Congress as best figure available and (2) <gloss

                                    6,500 less than active strength reported by you on 27 June 1957
                                    as 624,908, which figure was footnoted with statement as
                                    follows: “Includes reserves on active duty and varies with

                                    savings. Because the number involved in reduction from actual
                                    strength numerically is less than two-thirds that of reduction
                                    from authorized strength (i.e. 60,000 vs. 100,000), negotiations
                                    on basis of former could be better from public relations
                                    viewpoint (see Part II).</p>

                        <p>493. <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> correspondent <persName>Foster
                                Hailey</persName>, long time friend of President <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, told me yesterday that when he
                            visited Chinhae December 28 President was highly emotional in
                            condemnation of armed forces reduction proposed by U.S. Hailey said
                            Presidential Secretary Park Chon II, who met him at airfield and gave
                            him memo on subjects President planned to discuss, seemed genuinely
                            disturbed over possible outcome of President’s bitterness and
                            excitement; and that during his three hours of conversation with
                            President, Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> frequently
                            nodded agreement when Hailey attempted counsel moderation.</p>
                        <p>Hailey said President talked of re-examining relations with the U.S., of
                            “going it alone”, of “committing national suicide”, of blasting the
                                <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> in a public statement. He
                            complained shipment of modern weapons to Korea had been frequently
                            “postponed”; he did not see how he could agree to reduction of forces
                            before such weapons arrived; and wondered whether they ever would
                            arrive. He complained further that soldiers demobilized under reduction
                            plan would constitute additional strain on Korean economy, and <gloss
                                target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had not offered funds to help solve
                            this problem. Hailey tried point out impracticability and unwisdom of
                            taking any drastic steps at this time, and suggested if President
                                <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> could stimulate Senators
                            and Congressmen to oppose reduction results would probably be more
                            desirable than if President <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>
                            openly condemned the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss>. <persName
                                corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> argued that soliciting support in
                            the U.S. would be a tedious process but asked Hailey to give him a memo
                            with his suggestions.</p>
                        <p>During visit with President, Hailey was shown a memo from Min Kim Chong
                            Yul requesting policy guidance on reduction of forces; reminding
                            President that unilateral action would be futile without U.S. logistic
                            support; and expressing view hostilities in Korea were not likely to be
                            renewed unless there was war between U.S. and <gloss target="#t_USSR1"
                                >USSR</gloss>.</p>
                        <p>President’s remarks to Hailey indicate he had received report of General
                                <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">Decker</persName>’s and my 8:30 am
                            meeting with Defense Minister<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2">See <ref
                                    target="#d264"><hi rend="italic">infra</hi></ref>.</note> in
                            Seoul just prior to Hailey’s arrival Chinhae around noon. Hailey said
                            before conversation ended President seemed to have calmed down; that he
                            actually changed subject and discussed Confucianism.</p>
                        <pb n="535" xml:id="pg_535" facs="0563"/>
                        <p>Fact that President asked Hailey for recommendations in memo would seem
                            he was not in mood to take wholly impetuous action. It is to be hoped
                            Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName>, Park Chon II, and
                            others will dissuade him from taking any drastic step. President and
                            Mrs. <persName corresp="#p_RS1">Rhee</persName> expected return Seoul
                            December 31.</p>

                            Government were planning to review their policies. He said they would
                            have to decide whether the situation warranted remaining on a war
                            footing with little or no regard for the economy, or whether the
                            military establishment should be cut on the assumption that the cold war
                            would go on for many years. I suggested to Mike that it would be unwise
                            to adopt one assumption or the other—i.e., put all his eggs in one
                            basket; and both General <persName corresp="#p_DGGH1">Decker</persName>
                            and I urged Mike to advocate the closest approach possible to a golden
                            mean between the two extremes. We tried to convince Mike that under the
                            circumstances this was the only practical solution.</p>
                        <p>During our meeting on December 28 Mike<persName>Kim</persName> seemed
                            perfectly calm and businesslike and Paik Sun Yup merely listened. By the
                            time you read this we may have received some indication of the
                            President’s conclusions, but I can’t help feeling that
                                Mike<persName>Kim</persName> was a little optimistic when he said he
                            would hope to have the answer before January 10. If they appear to be
                            dragging their feet I may, in view of <pb n="537" xml:id="pg_537"
