                    Everett Gleason, Chief of the Foreign Relations Division, with additional review
                    by Richardson Dougall.</p>
                <p>Herbert A. Fine prepared the sections on the Near East, and David H. Stauffer
                    those on South Asia and Africa. Paul Claussen, Margaret G. Martin, and Ruth M.

                <p>The editors acknowledge with appreciation the assistance provided them by the
                    historians of the Department of Defense, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
                    They are also grateful for the cooperation of the National Security Council, the
                    Department of Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency, which concurred in
                    the declassification of various papers for release herein.</p>

                    the state of Israel in 1948.</p>

                        These volumes include, subject to necessary security considerations, all

                        the record is guided by the principles of historical objectivity. There may
                        be no alteration of the text, no deletions without indicating where in the
                        text the deletion is made, and no omission of facts which were of major
                        importance in reaching a decision. Nothing may be omitted for the purpose of
                        concealing or glossing over what might be regarded by some as a defect of
                        policy. However, certain omissions of documents are permissible for the

                                the security of the Eastern Mediterranean and of the Middle East was
                                “vital to the security of the United States” and that it should be
                                the policy of the United States Government “to make evident in a

                            <p>On August 2 Secretary of Defense Forrestal concurred in the following
                                views of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>For the purpose of this memorandum the “Eastern Mediterranean
                                        and Middle East Area” is viewed as being two separate areas.
                                        The first, referred to as the “Eastern Mediterranean area”,
                                        includes the landed areas of Egypt, the Levant States and
                                        Turkey. The other, referred to as the “Middle East Area”, is
                                        comprised of the land areas of Iraq, Iran and Arabian
                                        peninsula.</p>
                                    <p>Short-range emergency plans approved for planning purposes
                                        within the military establishment and other studies in
                                        process of development consider holding the
                                        Cairo-Suez-Khartoum area in the Eastern Mediterranean as a
                                        minimum. This area would be used initially as a base for air
                                        offensive action and, in later phases, as a base for further
                                        operations to regain Middle East oil resources. The
                                        possibilities of success in these operations cannot be
                                        accurately forecast at this time. In addition to retaining
                                        this minimum base area, such plans provide for retention of
                                        as much of the Middle East oil resources as allied
                                        capability will permit.</p>
                                    <p>Other plans are under consideration which involve the
                                        employment of bases other than the Cairo-Suez area.
                                        Implementation of the latter plans would not permit
                                        augmenting forces already deployed in the Eastern
                                        Mediterranean area or the Middle East area at the outbreak
                                        of war sufficiently to assure retention of either after the
                                        initial stages. The forces deployed in these two areas would
                                        operate there as long as feasible in support of the over-all
                                        plan. These plans provide for the regaining of a portion of
                                        the Middle East oil resources prior to the <pb n="3"

                                        war. The possibilities of success in these operations depend
                                        to some extent upon the development of the political
                                        situation in this area.</p>

                                        the geographical locations of the Middle East oil resources
                                        with respect to the USSR, and consideration of the probable
                                        early objectives of Soviet military operations in the event
                                        of war in the near future lead to the conclusion that United
                                        States and Allied forces presently available probably could
                                        not retain the major portion of the oil-producing areas from
                                        the outset. However, Allied forces can deny the enemy use of
                                        oil-producing facilities in the area. (<gloss

                                    n="2" xml:id="d3fn2">Not printed.</note> indicating that the
                                refusal early in January of the Prime Minister of Iraq to grant a
                                pipeline right of way to Standard and its associates will probably
                                necessitate the abandonment of the proposed pipeline project. The
                                Prime Minister took the position that Iraq would not grant a
                                pipeline right of way to any company in which any American capital
                                participates because of the United States position regarding the
                                Palestine question.</p>
                            <p>The project, if completed, would transport from 400,000 to 500,000
                                barrels daily of crude oil from Kuwait and Iran to the Eastern
                                Mediterranean; would be owned 50% by Anglo-Iranian, 40% by Standard,
                                10% by <gloss target="#t_Socony1">Socony</gloss>, and would be
                                constructed of pipe 32″ to 34″ in size.<note n="3" xml:id="d3fn3"
                                    >Mr. Koegler informed Mr. Henderson on March 10 that <gloss
                                        target="#t_AIOC1">AIOC</gloss> desired to enlarge the size
                                    of the proposed pipeline and that the American partners did not
                                    wish to increase their share of the oil flow. Since it was
                                    necessary to reconcile the partners’ percentages of stock
                                    ownership with percentages of pipeline capacity, it had been
                                    tentatively agreed that ownership would be divided as follows:
                                        <gloss target="#t_AIOC1">AIOC</gloss> 60.9%; Jersey Standard

                                beginning not later than fulfillment of orders for the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> pipeline. Standard’s
                                participation is indispensable to the project because of financial
                                arrangements whereunder Standard is to be the principal source of
                                dollars needed for the purchase of the pipe.</p>
                            <p>Standard feels it is impracticable to undertake construction of some
                                80 to 90 tankers required to move a volume of oil at the rate of
                                400,000 barrels daily, a distance by water approximating 4,000 miles
                                as compared to some 900 miles by pipeline because of excessive
                                expenditures in money, steel and power machinery involved in the use
                                of tankers as compared with the pipeline.</p>
                            <p>Although there has been a change in government since Standard was
                                rebuffed early in January, it is believed that the new government in
                                Iraq would be even less likely to grant a pipeline right of way than
                                its predecessor and accordingly an approach under the present
                                circumstances would serve no useful purpose. Thus if the United
                                States or United Nations position regarding the Palestine question
                                and the decision of the Government of Iraq based thereon remain
                                unchanged, <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0020"/>it appears that
                                during a period of global oil shortage a pipeline project probably
                                will be abandoned which would otherwise make available some 400,000
                                to 500,000 barrels of oil daily. The impact of this loss in oil
                                supply will be felt primarily in Western Europe, the normal
                                consumption area of oil from the Middle East. According to the
                                Harriman, Krug and Herter reports the European Recovery Program may
                                be seriously retarded without Middle East oil.</p>
                            <p>The Department’s proposed reply states that the oil of the Middle
                                East is an important factor in the success of the European Recovery
                                Program, in the continued recovery of Europe and in our own national
                                interest. It is suggested that the company take no action at this
                                time which would result in the abandonment of the project.</p>

                                    League had agreed that no petroleum facilities or concessions
                                    would be considered by member states until the Palestine
                                    situation had been clarified (890B.00/2–2348). Cairo advised, on
                                    February 29, of further information from Azzam Pasha that new
                                    construction of pipelines under concessions recently signed
                                    would not be permitted (telegram 206,

                                on future action by US and UN. His personal attitude was that
                                concessions should not be touched since they provided dollars
                                essential to Arab economy and Palestine defense but that trend of
                                public opinion Iraq and Saudi Arabia might alter picture. He was
                                certain that Syria would not ratify <gloss target="#t_Tapline1"
                                    >Tapline</gloss> and that as long as Nokrashy Pasha was Prime
                                Minister, Egypt would not grant Egyptian terminus. Said Arab League
                                thinking had not gone as far as planning operation of refineries and
                                installations in Arab states should UN sanctions be applied.</p>

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Koegler</hi>: I am writing with
                                reference to your letter dated January 29<note n="1" xml:id="d5fn1"
                                    >Not printed.</note> regarding the probable need to abandon the
                                proposed pipeline project designed to transport oil from Iran and
                                Kuwait to the Eastern Mediterranean unless the Government of Iraq
                                changes its attitude in refusing to grant the necessary pipeline
                                right of way.</p>
                            <p>I note your statement that the Prime Minister of Iraq has
                                communicated to a representative of your company and to the Chairman
                                of Anglo-Iranian the refusal of his government to issue any pipeline
                                right of way to any company in which any American capital
                                participates because of the position taken by the United States with
                                respect to the Palestine question.</p>
                            <p>As you are no doubt aware, it is my strong feeling, in which the
                                Secretaries of Defense and the Interior concur, that the oil of the
                                Middle East is an important factor in the success of the European
                                Recovery Program and in the continued prosperity of Europe. It is
                                also an important factor in the more immediate sense of our own
                                national interest. It is hoped, therefore, that your company will
                                not find it necessary to take any action at this time which would
                                result in the abandonment of the project described in your letter.
                                It would be unfortunate for your company to allow current
                                international political complications to cause the abandonment of
                                long-range plans which may have beneficial effects on the Middle
                                East, Europe and the United States.</p>

                                    >infra</hi>, received scant attention during the high-level
                                “Pentagon Talks of 1947” between the United States and the United
                                Kingdom on the Middle East. Denis Greenhill, who represented the
                                British Foreign Office in the economic aspects of these talks,
                                discussed the matter of “Persian Gulf and Boundary Questions” with
                                officers of the Department on October 31, 1947. The memorandum of
                                that conversation, prepared by David A. Robertson of the Office of
                                Near Eastern and African Affairs, notes that views were exchanged on
                                the “continental shelf and territorial water principles”. The
                                memorandum records that “none of the Persian Gulf countries have
                                specifically declared their position as regards these principles,
                                that claims and counterclaims once embarked on might lead to
                                considerable confusion and that at some future appropriate date when
                                other issues in the area, including the Palestine question, are less
                                active, it might be advisable to suggest a general conference of the
                                countries concerned and attempt to work out the various boundary
                                questions.” (890.0145/10–347) For documentation on the “Pentagon

                                    <item>It was the view of those present that existing concessions
                                        do not include rights to the seabed or subsoil in the
                                        Persian Gulf, in the absence of specific provisions to that
                                        effect. None of those present was aware of the existence of
                                        any such provisions. Mr. Bromley said the Foreign Office had
                                        pointed out that provisions do exist under which additions
                                        to the territory of a country would be included in existing
                                        concessions, and that conceivably such provisions could be
                                        held to apply to subsea areas. It was considered by those
                                        present, however, that the intent of such provisions was
                                        directed solely to possible extensions of the land area of a
                                        country as normally defined, and not to subsea areas, apart
                                        from land under territorial waters.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The question of whether the declarations should include
                                        seabed and subsoil, or only subsoil, arose from the
                                        complication resulting from pearl fishery rights. Mr.
                                        Merriam said that in theory the matter could be handled in
                                        one of two ways. One way was to include both seabed and
                                        subsoil rights in the declarations but to make exception of
                                        existing fishery rights. The difficulty with this method
                                        would be in defining the pearling rights and establishing
                                        priority as between, say, pearling rights and oil rights.
                                        The pearling rights appeared to be largely a matter of
                                        custom and had not been reduced to writing. To endeavor to
                                        do so would be a difficult task leading to dispute, delay
                                        and, doubtless, acrimony. Therefore, since we were now
                                        interested primarily in oil, it would seem simpler to
                                        confine the declarations of sovereignty to the subsoil. When
                                        a conflict of rights resulted, as by contamination of
                                        fisheries by oil, damages would be paid.</item>

                                    <item>It was agreed that an assertion of sovereignty would be
                                        necessary, otherwise there would be no basis on which to

                                        a certain sanction in that it might be considered an
                                        extension of the <hi rend="italic">thalweg</hi> principle of

                                        be chosen. <list>

                                            <item>The American side said that it had given the
                                                Iranian aspect of the matter a good deal of thought.
                                                It was very probable, as suggested by the British,
                                                that the Iranians would utilize the occasion to
                                                reassert their alleged claims to Bahrein, etc. On
                                                the other hand, if the Iranians were not approached
                                                on the matter at the same time as the countries on
                                                the west side of the Gulf, it would look to the
                                                Iranians very much like a conspiracy from the west
                                                side backed by U.S. and UK. This would give a handle
                                                to the Russian propaganda machine and to pro-Soviet
                                                elements in Iran. In consequence, for reasons of
                                                principle and also as the lesser of two evils, the
                                                American side felt that it would be better to
                                                approach the Iranians on the matter at the same time
                                                and on the same footing as the countries on the
                                                western side of the Gulf. We visualized that in the
                                                end the matter might shake down by the Iranians
                                                including in their declarations something to the
                                                effect that nothing therein derogated from their
                                                claims. The other parties might respond by inserting
                                                in or amending their declarations to the effect that
                                                nothing therein constituted in any way a recognition
                                                of Iranian claims. Since these would all be
                                                unilateral declarations, and not agreements, the
                                                matter might go at that, the important thing being
                                                that the Iranians agree to the median line for the
                                                purposes of oil concessions. The British side took
                                                note of these observations, but pointed out that
                                                London appeared to be anxious not to give rise to a
                                                renewal of Iranian claims to Bahrein, etc.</item>

                                        make appropriate suggestions to the principalities with
                                        which UK had a protection relationship, and US and UK would
                                        make a concerted approach to the others: Iran, Iraq and
                                        Saudi Arabia.</item>

                                    <item>Since both US and UK are more or less in the Arab doghouse
                                        on account of Palestine, it will be necessary to keep an eye

                                    <item>The American side raised an additional point, that of
                                        secrecy in relation to oil companies. Once the new subsea
                                        areas were staked out they would be open to
                                        concession-hunting by any oil company. So far as US was
                                        concerned, we felt that our handling of the matter should
                                        not give any American company an advantage over any other
                                        American company. Thus far we had discouraged all American
                                        companies who had inquired, from seeking subsea oil
                                        concessions in the Gulf. In order to give all companies an
                                        even start, we felt that when US and UK made their
                                        approaches to the Persian Gulf governments, press releases
                                        should be issued simultaneously in Washington and London.
                                        Until then, we felt that strict secrecy vis-à-vis all oil
                                        companies should be preserved, otherwise companies on the
                                        ground and in close relations with the Persian Gulf
                                        governments would have an advantage over other companies.
                                        Mr. Jones said that maintenance of secrecy vis-à-vis British
                                        oil companies would be somewhat difficult owing to the
                                        relationships existing between the Government and some of
                                        the companies. Up to the present, however, the Government
                                        had put the companies off by saying that it was a
                                        complicated matter which was being studied.</item>

                            <p>In concluding, Mr. Merriam said that the foregoing represented
                                informal reactions on the working level to Mr. Bromley’s letter and
                                memorandum. The British had already let us have a map showing how
                                the median line principle might be applied to the sea areas in the
                                neighborhood of Bahrein. It would be most helpful if as the next
                                step the British could let us have a map showing the application of
                                the principle to the whole Persian Gulf, so that we could take such
                                a concrete suggestion for applying the principle into account in
                                working up a written reply to Mr. Bromley’s letter and enclosed
                                memorandum.</p>

                            <p>164. While in Riyadh March 27 King informed me most confidentially
                                    <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> had been approached by
                                foreign company having British participation through Central Mining
                                Company, London and American participation through Superior Oil
                                Company of Los Angeles seeking oil exploration and concessionary
                                rights in the off-shore area of Saudi Arabia in Persian Gulf. His
                                Majesty sent word to me upon my arrival and said it would be
                                appreciated if US Government would give him its opinion concerning
                                participation British capital in proposed <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12"

                                concessions to purely American capital.</p>
                            <p>Later, when I had my final audience with King, he asked my personal
                                opinion. I replied that since His Majesty in my last visit Riyadh
                                had himself expressed desire we, British and Saudi Arabians work
                                together in closest concert in maintaining peace and security Middle
                                East, I saw no objection admittance British capital in oil ventures.
                                I added that by strengthening Britain economically we were in effect
                                strengthening those forces best adapted to working with US. His
                                Majesty stated that such being my opinion he would give orders to
                                Finance Minister to begin discussion at once.</p>
                            <p>I observed that unless the question were pressing I would much prefer
                                him delay action until my government could give its opinion as it
                                might have altogether different views and in any case was able see
                                problem in much broader perspective than I was.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty accepted suggestion and said he would order Finance
                                Minister delay discussions for 30 days while awaiting answer from
                                Washington.</p>

                                the first time Ibn Saud indicated that he may be compelled, in
                                certain circumstances, to apply sanctions against the American oil
                                concessions.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Duce said that he could not explain the situation over the phone
                                but that he would come to Washington or send someone to Washington
                                to discuss the matter within the next few days. He said that it is
                                his understanding that Ibn Saud had made it clear that if he took
                                sanctions it would not be because of his desire to do so but because
                                the pressure upon him of Arab public opinion was so great that he
                                could no longer resist it.</p>
                            <p>Although I do not know what the circumstances might be which would
                                cause these sanctions to be applied, I obtained the impression that
                                the making of changes in our arms policy so as to permit the
                                shipment of arms to the Jewish State would create such

                            <p>Mr. Duce went on to say that since the Government of Saudi Arabia is
                                known to be negotiating with Superior Oil and with a British company
                                with the intention of granting a concession for such areas under the
                                Persian Gulf as may be acquired by Saudi Arabia under the
                                contemplated division of the Persian Gulf, <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> has retained the services of

                            <p>Mr. Henderson said that it seemed to him that the main question was: <list>

                            <p>Mr. Kay said that the question might be framed in another way: <list>

                                    <item>Has the Saudi Arabian Government anything to grant?</item>

                                    <item>Does the Company want to exercise its option?</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>He said that the <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> officials
                                had come to invite State Department consideration of their request
                                that this matter rest until the Company could examine the question
                                thoroughly, at which time <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>
                                would like to discuss it in detail with the United States
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hudson said that it had been impossible to take a definite
                                position as yet. While the term “islands and territorial waters” is
                                used in the <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> concession,
                                the Government of Saudi Arabia apparently feels that although
                                territorial waters were included, the outer bed of the sea was not
                                included. The Arabs usually think in terms of “coastal waters”.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Henderson said that the Department was interested in the matter
                                because the US does not want American companies quarreling over
                                their supposed rights in the Persian Gulf, and because we want world
                                peace. We are afraid that if a country like Saudi Arabia announces
                                that it has given concessions in the Gulf other countries will do
                                the same. He went on to say that the US is working with the British
                                on a plan for the establishment of the rights of the Persian Gulf
                                States through a division of the Gulf by a median line. We would
                                then want to approach the governments of the Persian Gulf states to
                                see if they would reach agreement. We are concerned over the effects
                                on world peace if various claims should be debated before a
                                scientific division has been worked out and accepted by the States
                                concerned. We have told King Ibn Saud that we were working on the
                                problem. Furthermore we asked Superior Oil to take no steps in the
                                    <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0032"/>Gulf for the time being.
                                Superior, however, chose to disregard this request. If we now said
                                to Superior that it should postpone the whole matter, <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> might go ahead. The fairest
                                way, therefore, would seem for <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"
                                    >Aramco</gloss> and Superior to agree that neither company will
                                approach the King until the scientific division of the Gulf has
                                taken place, and for the British company to conduct itself
                                similarly.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ray stated that more than a month ago his company had heard that
                                Superior Oil and Trinidad Leaseholds, a British corporation, were
                                trying to establish a claim to the area in the Persian Gulf east of
                                    <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>’s present concession
                                but within the area of the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia had
                                rights. <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> takes the position
                                that there is no subsea territory east of its present concession for
                                which Saudi Arabia has the right to grant concessions. When the
                                Company suggested starting drilling in the Persian Gulf the Saudi
                                Arabian Government said to put it off. Later <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                    >SAG</gloss> told <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> it
                                was all right to go ahead with such drilling, provided <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> would accept the terms of a
                                contract which <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> was working out
                                with Superior which had a much higher royalty basis than the present
                                    <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> contract. Speaking for
                                    <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>, Mr. Ray said he felt
                                that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> had a right to the
                                subsea lands of Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf. Judge Hudson said
                                that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> thinks Superior may
                                get a concession outside the <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"
                                    >Aramco</gloss> area as defined by <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                    >SAG</gloss>. He pointed out that if this should happen many
                                difficulties would arise, including the use of the piers and
                                facilities built by <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>. Judge
                                Hudson then questioned Mr. Henderson about the nature of the “median
                                line” and the countries to be affected by it. He was told that the
                                line would affect Iraq, Kuwait, the Kuwait Neutral Zone, Saudi
                                Arabia, Bahrein, Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and Iran. The median
                                line would follow the contour of the mainland and would be worked
                                out scientifically by the best geographers in the US and British
                                governments.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Henderson said that it appeared that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"
                                    >Aramco</gloss> had the choice of meeting the competition
                                provided by Superior or of asking for a postponement. On being told
                                that the latter had been the <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"
                                    >Aramco</gloss> plan until the receipt of recent information
                                from Arabia, Mr. Henderson continued that the US Government must be
                                careful not to side with any one American company against another.
                                We felt that it was undesirable for the security of the Persian Gulf
                                and Saudi Arabia’s own security as well, for the King to grant
                                concessions until a scientific median line has been worked out, and
                                we had suggested to the King that he grant no concessions until this
                                had been done, and until the meaning of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> contract had been decided
                                upon.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hudson said that the interpretation of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> contract will take some time,
                                and that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> would like to
                                wait on the matter <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0033"/>until the
                                interpretation is worked out, but that it could not do so in the
                                light of the new circumstances.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Duce added that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> wants
                                more time for study but Superior Oil has been discussing this
                                problem with the Saudi Arabian Government. He felt that the term
                                “territorial waters” was a confusing one. On being asked the terms
                                of the proposed Superior Oil concession in the Persian Gulf, Mr.
                                Duce said that they involved the payment of four gold shillings per
                                ton, plus 20 percent of the gross, clearly a much higher figure than
                                the <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> concession and one
                                which, if it went through, would upset the whole Persian Gulf
                                concession structure.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Henderson asked the <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>
                                officials present not to reduce this conversation to writing and to
                                inform only those Company officials who were directly concerned.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Duce pointed out that the same problem exists in relation to
                                Kuwait and possibly the Neutral Zone. Mr. Robertson suggested that
                                the US and the British companies involved should work out their
                                problem but that without waiting for this the US and British
                                governments should go ahead with the project of drawing up a median
                                line.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Ray ended the meeting by saying that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"
                                    >Aramco</gloss> was bringing several of its top officials home
                                about June 14, and that perhaps it would be best for <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> to take up the option for
                                these new offshore Arabian oil lands, as offered by King Ibn Saud,
                                on the same terms as Superior has been offering and then see what
                                should be done.</p>

                                    June 16 with Messrs. Bromley and Jones of the British Embassy.
                                    Mr. Sanger’s memorandum of conversation states that “Mr. Boggs
                                    produced copies of a map on which he had worked out a tentative
                                    median line in the Persian Gulf and described the principles on
                                    which this line had been drawn. He pointed out that in most
                                    cases the line was equally distant from both shores of the Gulf
                                    but that in some cases islands had been considered as parts of
                                    the mainland.” Mr. Bromley promised to send the map to London
                                    (890.0145/6–1648). At a meeting with the same British officials
                                    on June 30, Mr. Boggs was said to have “presented a new map
                                    which he had prepared showing the division of the submerged area
                                    among the riparian states, with the central median line drawn
                                    primarily through points equidistant from the shore rather than,
                                    as previously, from island points near the shore. It was agreed
                                    that this map be forwarded to London as an amendment to the one
                                    previously submitted.” (Mr. Sanger’s memorandum of conversation,
                                    890.0145/6–3048). Neither map is found attached to the

                                jeopardize US and Brit relations with Iran. Iran Govt would probably
                                learn of preliminary negotiations and even if matter could be kept
                                secret sudden announcement of agreement among all Arab States
                                concerned would still more provoke Iranian resentment. Since it
                                would be obvious that US and Brit had taken leading role in matter,
                                resentment would be directed against us as well as against Arab
                                States. This resentment would undoubtedly be fanned by Soviet
                                propaganda and Soviet agents in Iran who would argue that our action
                                showed Iranian reliance on American and Brit friendship was
                                unjustified.</p>
                            <p>Brit were told we thought preferable procedure would be for you to
                                approach Shah informally and explain importance to Iran of having
                                Iranian rights to subsea oil amicably determined in accordance
                                logical principles and request Shah’s assistance in presenting
                                matter most effectively to Iran Govt. We would hope that if matter
                                presented in right light Iran Govt might agree not to raise
                                Bahrein-Kuwait issue in this connection or at least formula could be
                                found which would permit agreement on delimitation of subsea rights
                                without prejudicing Iranian claims to those two territories. Brit
                                Reps agreed this suggestion worth consideration and have referred it
                                to London. We would appreciate your views re this suggested
                                procedure.</p>
                            <p>Since Bahrein issue is particularly thorny point in connection
                                Persian Gulf oil rights and appears likely to be recurring source of

                                well attempt settle it once and for all by early reference
                                International Court of Justice. Such reference would enable Iran
                                Govt to satisfy domestic public opinion by pointing out it was
                                taking logical steps through established international channels to
                                assert Iranian claim. <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0036"/>At same
                                time this claim appears so ill-founded that there would seem little
                                doubt Court would rule in favor Brit position and provide Brit and
                                Bahreinis with conclusive settlement removing this controversial

                                    <p>This pipe will be used to construct a pipeline in Iran from
                                        the oil field at Agha Jari to the port of Bandar Maschur on
                                        the Persian Gulf. The new line will have a daily capacity of
                                        100,000 barrels of crude oil. Of this amount, a minimum of
                                        40,000 barrels has been contracted for delivery to the US,
                                        and a considerable additional quantity may also become

                                    <p>OIT officials emphasized that the construction of the line
                                        between Agha Jari and Bandar Maschur—a distance of only 48
                                        miles represents the most efficient use of this quantity of
                                        pipe. The oil wells have already been drilled, and the
                                        necessary dock installations and storage facilities have
                                        already been constructed. The 11,650 tons of heavy pipe
                                        which constitutes the entire steel requirement of this
                                        pipeline has already been fabricated and is at dockside
                                        awaiting shipment. The construction of this line will make
                                        available more oil for the quantity of steel involved than
                                        any other pending project. The pipeline will be completed by
                                        June, 1949.</p>

                                        allocations will be determined. The length of the proposed
                                        Trans-Arabian pipeline is over 1100 miles, and construction
                                        could not be completed before early 1950. When completed,
                                        the Trans-Arabian line will provide a more efficient means
                                        of transportation from the oil fields to the Mediterranean
                                        than the present use of tankers.</p>
                                    <p>OIT officials stated that the postponement of consideration
                                        of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company’s applications for
                                        oil-line pipe will not prejudice applications by the company
                                        for licenses to export material other than heavy pipe which
                                        may be required to continue construction on a reduced basis,

                            <p>Mr. Robertson referred to Mr. Bromley’s letter of July 20<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d20fn1">No. G59/—/48, addressed to Gordon H. Mattison,
                                    then acting as Chief of the Division of Near Eastern Affairs.
                                    The note and its enclosure not printed.</note> to Mr. Mattison,
                                enclosing a telegram to the British Embassy from the Foreign Office
                                dated July 17, 1948, concerning the Persian Gulf offshore oil
                                question. He said that the Department was very happy to have learned
                                that the Foreign Office had accepted the American recommendation <pb
                                    n="25" xml:id="pg_25" facs="0039"/>that Iran not be presented
                                with a “fait accompli” and that she be informed of the US-UK
                                recommendations along with the other Persian Gulf states. He also
                                noted that in the British telegram of July 17 it had been suggested
                                that the UK approach the Sheikhdoms under British protection and the
                                Sultan of Muscat, while the US and UK might approach Saudi Arabia,
                                Iraq, and Iran. He said that he wondered whether the approach to the
                                Sheikhdoms was to precede that to the other countries, or whether
                                both approaches were to be simultaneous. Mr. Bromley said he
                                believed they were to be simultaneous. Mr. Mattison mentioned that,
                                if the UK were to approach the Sultan of Muscat, it should do so on
                                behalf of the US, since we are in direct diplomatic relationship
                                with the Sultan, although we do not at present have a representative
                                accredited to him. Mr. Robertson also suggested that it would be
                                necessary to determine whether the approaches to the Sultan of
                                Muscat, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia were to be joint or parallel. It
                                was agreed that they should be parallel.</p>
                            <p>It was agreed between the Americans and the British present that any
                                statement by either Government which might be made to the oil
                                companies, concerning the possibility of securing concessions
                                covering the offshore area, should not be made until declarations
                                had been made by the individual rulers announcing the offshore area
                                under their jurisdiction. No public statement would be volunteered
                                by the US and UK concerning the role which they had played in
                                submitting recommendations to the riparian states. Mr. Moline
                                suggested that it might be advisable, however, for the US and UK to
                                prepare some statement concerning their role which could if
                                necessary be made available should inquiries be made by the UN or
                                other bodies. Mr. Jones said that he felt, as a matter of fact, that
                                a certain amount of publicity concerning the Anglo-American
                                discussions had already gone the rounds in oil circles. Mr.
                                Robertson inquired whether the British thought any other countries,
                                such as Iraq, had learned of our discussions. Mr. Bromley replied
                                that, so far as he knew, Iraq had not.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Satterthwaite asked if the British Government’s policy was to
                                encourage competition among the British oil companies and not to
                                select any chosen instrument. He pointed out that the US Government
                                favors open competition as regards American companies. The British
                                representatives replied that the British Government is also favoring
                                open competition. Mr. Jones pointed out that actually very few
                                British companies would be in a position to undertake offshore
                                exploitation, since only a few possessed the necessary technical
                                skill and equipment.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Robertson then referred to the use by the British in their
                                telegram of the words “sovereignty” and “annexation”. He said that
                                the <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0040"/>Department would like
                                again to express its desire that these words not be used. He pointed
                                out that neither in the Continental Shelf Fisheries Proclamation nor
                                in the companion Natural Resources Proclamation issued by the
                                President had these words been used. He felt that it would be much
                                wiser to follow the language of the President’s Continental Shelf
                                Proclamation, i.e., “jurisdiction and control,” in this problem of
                                the Persian Gulf. He said that if we were to depart from the
                                language of the declaration a considerable delay might be caused,
                                because it would then be necessary to consult with the fishery
                                experts of the Department and with the Department of Interior, which
                                had been responsible for the text of the President’s declarations.
                                The Department of State could not endorse the use of “sovereignty”
                                and “annexation” as regards the Persian Gulf without prior agreement
                                by the Department of Interior.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boggs pointed out in this connection that when the President’s
                                Continental Shelf Proclamation was drawn up great care had been
                                taken in the choice of the language used, and he felt sure that the
                                drafters had avoided the use of “sovereignty” and “annexation” with
                                good reason.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gray said that from the legal standpoint he also felt that it
                                would be advisable to follow the language of the President’s
                                declaration. He felt particularly that, were some expression such as
                                “sovereignty over the subsoil and seabed” to be used, complications
                                and misunderstandings might result as a consequence of which it
                                might be believed that the riparian states were annexing the
                                complete area affected, including the high seas. He then inquired
                                specifically of the British whether they had in mind any such
                                annexation of an area as was involved in the case of the Gulf of
                                Paria, between Venezuela and Trinidad. The British replied that they
                                had not.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boggs said that he felt the question of annexing the resources of
                                the subsoil was similar to that of acquiring fishing rights. In the
                                latter case one would assert rights over the fish alone, and it
                                seemed to him that in the former case it would be sufficient to
                                assert rights over the resources alone.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bromley said that he would endeavor to clarify the question with
                                the Foreign Office. He added that the primary British objective was
                                to assure, for the riparian states, that no other state would ever
                                be able to assert rights in the Gulf in opposition to those asserted
                                by the riparian states. He had in mind in particular any Russian
                                effort to establish a position in the Gulf. Mr. Robertson suggested
                                that it might be possible to work out some kind of formula which
                                would preclude any such intrusion into the Gulf by a third
                                party.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mattison pointed out that from a political point of view it might
                                be easier to persuade the riparian states to accept a concept of <pb
                                    n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0041"/>jurisdiction rather than one
                                of sovereignty since if it were merely a question of jurisdiction,
                                the difficult problems of fishing rights and pearling rights, such
                                as those of Bahrein, would not arise.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Robertson then asked whether it was the British intention to
                                cancel the possibility of a conference in London, or whether it was
                                merely to be postponed. Mr. Bromley replied that the British desire
                                at the moment was to move ahead as fast as possible without holding
                                the proposed conference and to work out general principles before
                                working out the specific principles which would govern the drawing
                                of a map. Mr. Robertson asked if the British had had any reaction
                                from London on Mr. Boggs’ map and memorandum. Mr. Bromley said that
                                they had, inasmuch as London had said they were working on their own
                                memorandum in reply. Mr. Robertson said that it would be advisable
                                to have the map worked out before specific recommendations were made
                                to the riparian states. Mr. Mattison said that it would be much
                                easier for the riparian states to accept the US-UK recommendations
                                if they had the advantage of a visual presentation showing which
                                segment of the Gulf would fall to each state. Mr. Bromley agreed
                                that the map should be prepared before recommendations were made. It
                                was therefore recognized that the discussions from now on would fall
                                into two stages. The first would involve reaching agreement on basic
                                principles, and the second would involve reaching agreement on the
                                implementation of the principles through drawing of a map.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bromley agreed to submit, as soon as possible, a precise
                                statement of what the Foreign Office would consider a proper
                                statement of principles to be submitted to the riparian states.
                                These could then be discussed between the State Department and the
                                British representatives with the view to working out the final
                                agreed set of recommendations.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Gray then introduced the question of what form the proclamation
                                which might be issued by a riparian state should take. It was felt
                                in general that a sample form might be submitted to all of the
                                states, but it was to be hoped that each state would not promulgate
                                the same identical text in each case.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Robertson said that the State Department was faced with a
                                specific problem about which he desired to ask the opinion of the
                                British. The Saudi Arabian Government had asked the United States
                                Government for advice concerning the granting of a Saudi offshore
                                concession, and the <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> had asked
                                the Saudi Government to defer action until receipt of US-UK
                                recommendations. The problem now was one of deciding when we could
                                inform the Saudi Government that we felt it might feel free to grant
                                a concession. Would the US and UK insist that agreement be reached
                                by all the riparian states before we would recommend to any
                                individual state that it grant a concession? <pb n="28"
                                    xml:id="pg_28" facs="0042"/>Mr. Bromley said that he felt that
                                we should not wait for any such general agreement. When the US and
                                UK had reached agreement on the solution of “the problem” posed by
                                the <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> we would simply submit our
                                recommendations to the riparian states. They would then be free to
                                take whatever action they chose. Mr. Robertson said that he believed
                                the US and UK might desire to be sure that Saudi Arabia would accept
                                our principles before approving the taking of action by any other
                                riparian state on the basis of our recommendations. Once Saudi
                                Arabia was satisfied, the US and UK would not insist upon general
                                agreement among all the riparian states. Mr. Mattison pointed out
                                that of course we would not approve the granting by King Ibn Saud of
                                a concession over any offshore territory which would rightfully
                                belong to some other state.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boggs pointed out that in the President’s Continental Shelf
                                Proclamation it had been stated that in cases where continental
                                shelf running from the shores of the US was shared by it with an
                                adjoining state or with a state lying opposite the US, it would be
                                necessary for agreement to be reached by the US and the other state
                                on the basis of equitable principles before the shelf could be
                                considered divided between them. Mr. Jones repeated that, as he saw
                                it, all that was involved was a presentation by the US and the UK to
                                the riparian states of principles which we desired them to adopt,
                                and that formal agreement between themselves did not appear
                                necessary. It was agreed that negotiations between states was
                                unnecessary.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boggs said that he hoped that the Foreign Office, in raising the
                                whole question of offshore oil to the British cabinet, would be sure
                                to include the question of principles affecting the drawing of the
                                median and transversal lines. He said that he felt most anxious that
                                this should be done since he is working on problems of division in
                                another area where there are no islands involved and he would like
                                to see scientific principles adopted. Mr. Bromley then remarked that
                                the question of islands was indeed a difficult one and that the
                                Saudi Foreign Office had discussed the question of jurisdiction over
                                islands with Ambassador Trott. They had in particular been
                                discussing the status of Farsi Island.</p>
                            <p>At the close of the meeting Mr. Robertson pointed out that it would
                                be necessary for the US and the UK to determine whether they would
                                look with favor upon the granting by Iran of the concession covering
                                Iran’s offshore area. Mr. Robertson said that the US Government
                                would not be anxious to see such a concession granted, and Mr.
                                Bromley said that similarly the British Government would not like to
                                see one granted.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, it was agreed that attention should now be given to
                                (1) drafting a set of principles and (2) drafting a suggested
                                proclamation.</p>

                                <hi rend="italic">Background</hi>. The Department long has
                                endeavored to maintain the open door and non-discrimination policy
                                with respect to the opportunity of American nationals to obtain
                                foreign oil concessions, the most notable example of Department
                                intervention to achieve this being the Iraq Petroleum Company case
                                following the first World War. Subsequently, both with and without
                                Department help, other American companies other than those in the
                                    <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> have obtained important
                                Middle East oil concessions, and by 1945 all but the apparently less
                                promising areas had been brought under concession by a small group
                                of British and American companies. Among them, through contracts and
                                partnership arrangements, close relationships had come to exist in
                                respect to Middle East oil. Confronted with this factual situation
                                and with the holdings of some companies so large as to preclude any
                                possibility of development within any reasonable period, the
                                Department began to consider seriously the development of a Middle
                                East oil policy. It was then suggested that it might take the form
                                of encouraging new companies not now holding concessions in the area
                                to bid for the remaining areas open and of discouraging existing
                                companies with large undeveloped areas from seeking them. It was
                                also suggested that companies holding large areas might be
                                encouraged promptly to examine such areas and relinquish those they
                                did not desire to keep and develop without inordinate delay. A wide
                                measure of agreement on the soundness of these suggestions seemed to
                                exist within the Department.</p>
                            <p>The Department discussed the foregoing policy with the American
                                partners in the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> at the time the
                                latter company was considering acquiring a concession in
                                Transjordan. None the less <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> added
                                the <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0044"/>concession to its
                                widespread holdings in the Middle East. In the case of Kuwait, the
                                Department made the ruler’s interest in granting a concession known
                                to several independent American companies, and an independent
                                company was successful in obtaining the concession.</p>
                            <p>For several months the Government of Saudi Arabia has been
                                contending, contrary to the view of the Arabian American Oil
                                Company, that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>’s 440,000
                                square mile concession in Saudi Arabia does not include offshore
                                areas in the Persian Gulf beyond territorial waters. The Government
                                has also been negotiating with Superior Oil Company and Central
                                Mining Investment, Ltd., operating jointly for this purpose, with a
                                view to granting a concession to some 10,000 square miles of these

                            <p>A memorandum left at the Department on July 21 by Superior
                                    officials<note n="2" xml:id="d21fn2">Not printed.</note> states
                                that the Government has informed Superior of its intention to give
                                the company the concession on the basis of the company’s present
                                offer. The Department has little specific information regarding
                                details of the proposed concession. The memorandum also refers to a
                                competitive offer by <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>
                                regarding the area in question which Superior contends is a tacit
                                admission that the existing concession does not cover offshore areas
                                beyond territorial waters.</p>
                            <p>
                                <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> has not conceded the
                                latter point. One cable from Jidda, among those which confirm the
                                fact of an offer by <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>,
                                refers to it as a consideration for “clarification” of the basic
                                    <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> contract.</p>
                            <p>The position of the Department as it has been made known to the
                                Government of Saudi Arabia, to <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"
                                    >Aramco</gloss>, and to the Superior Oil Company has been that
                                the question of whether or not the existing concession covered
                                offshore areas was a matter to be settled between <gloss
                                    target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> and the Government of Saudi
                                Arabia and that if the offshore areas were not covered by the
                                existing concession it would be preferable that no new concession be
                                granted to any company until the areas of the Persian Gulf, over
                                which riparian states had jurisdiction, had been determined on an
                                equitable and scientific basis. It was made known that this
                                Government, together with the British, was working to determine on
                                such a basis, the limits of the areas over which the riparian states
                                might wish to proclaim their jurisdiction. In addition,
                                representatives of the Superior Oil Company were told in response to
                                a direct inquiry on the point that the Department favored the entry
                                of independent oil interests into the Middle East, but could not
                                favor any one company over another.</p>
                            <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0045"/>
                            <p>For implementing the policy of widening company participation in the
                                development of Middle East oil, it would seem preferable that
                                particular concession opportunities be made known to as large a
                                number of interested independent companies as possible. It appears,
                                however, that in the present case of Saudi Arabia’s offshore areas
                                the complications in the form of potential disagreement between
                                neighboring states as to respective areas of jurisdiction in the
                                Gulf, together with the progress of current negotiations, may not
                                permit this preferable procedure to be followed. It is a real
                                possibility that <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> will
                                obtain the right to exploit the offshore area whether or not as a
                                “clarification” of its basic contract and notwithstanding the
                                Superior statement that the Government has agreed to give the latter
                                the concession. Should this occur a major opportunity for the
                                participation in Middle East oil development of a company
                                independent of existing concessionaires in the area will have been
                                lost.</p>

                                upon it. When Mr. Maclean and Mr. Jones had finished reading the
                                draft, Mr. Jones commented that it appeared to him to be much the
                                same as the British draft, except that the American draft
                                re-introduced the words “jurisdiction and control” as a substitute
                                for the words “boundaries” or “sovereignty”, which the British had
                                previously suggested. Mr. Hare explained that the Department had
                                found it imperative to suggest that the word “sovereignty” not be
                                used, primarily because the division of the Department concerned
                                with fisheries activities had felt it important for certain reasons
                                not to depart from the language of the US declaration of 1945
                                affecting the continental shelf. Mr. Hare then asked Mr. Looney,
                                representing the Fish and Wild Life section of the International
                                Resources Division, if he would comment on his Division’s position.
                                Mr. Looney said that inasmuch as the President had on the same date
                                in 1945 issued two proclamations, one concerning the continental
                                shelf and the other concerning fisheries,<note n="4" xml:id="d23fn4"
                                    >Both proclamations were covered in the press release issued by
                                    the White House on September 28, 1945, printed in <ref

                                declarations had become linked in the minds of most observers, and
                                that any action affecting the one might be interpreted as affecting
                                the other. His Division felt that it was most important, however, to
                                maintain a distinction between <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0047"
                                />activities affecting the shelf and activities affecting fisheries
                                in the high seas, although maintenance of this distinction
                                constitutes a difficult problem. His Division felt that if
                                sovereignty were declared over the continental shelf rather than
                                jurisdiction and control, it would be inevitable for the concept of
                                sovereignty over the shelf to be extended and to be translated to
                                sovereignty over fisheries activities in the high seas and then over
                                the high seas themselves. He noted that five other governments had
                                already issued declarations of sovereignty over both the continental
                                shelf and the high seas above it. As he believed the British
                                representatives knew, their Government had been informed that the US
                                had lodged complaints with three of those five governments against
                                those declarations of sovereignty. Mr. Jones interrupted at this
                                point to say that whereas the British had originally desired a
                                declaration of “sovereignty” over the continental shelf beneath the
                                waters of the Persian Gulf, they had (in order to accommodate the US
                                desire not to use “sovereignty”) dropped that word from their
                                proposed declaration and had suggested merely an extension of
                                boundaries to include the shelf. Mr. Mattison and Mr. Gray then
                                pointed out that although this was true, the Department had felt
                                that an extension of boundaries necessarily meant an extension of
                                sovereignty, and that the concept of a boundary extension was
                                perhaps even stronger than a declaration of sovereignty. Therefore,
                                the Department felt that mere omission of the word “sovereignty” did
                                not settle the problem.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Looney then went on to note that the five countries which had
                                proclaimed complete sovereignty were Argentina, Chile, Peru, Costa
                                Rica and Mexico. (In the case of Mexico the declaration was not
                                final, inasmuch as it will require constitutional amendment.) The
                                Department, moreover, feared that other countries were contemplating
                                similar declarations. It was feared that Iceland and Cuba were
                                preparing them, and that Nicaragua and China might also take such
                                action. The question of the US attitude toward such declarations of
                                sovereignty was, therefore, assuming a world-wide scope.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hare pointed out that he recognized that there was in fact very
                                little difference between the concepts of “sovereignty” and of
                                “jurisdiction and control,” and that the difference was largely a
                                matter of “shading”, but that it was this “shading” which seemed of
                                great importance to the Department, since different consequences
                                would result upon the use of one or the other. Mr. Jones said that
                                he appreciated there was this difference of “shading.” Mr. Looney
                                said that, although he was not prepared to comment in great legal
                                detail upon the difference between concepts of “sovereignty” and
                                “jurisdiction and control,” his Division felt that there was a real
                                difference which could <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0048"/>not he
                                ignored. Mr. Gray pointed out the chief problem in the eyes of the
                                Legal Division was that the US continental shelf declaration
                                represented a doctrine so new that great care must be taken in any
                                matters having to do with it, especially since there had already
                                been proclamations by other countries which constituted perversions
                                of our doctrine. He pointed out that the Legal Division feels that
                                in order for any nation to assert jurisdiction, that: nation must
                                also assume a degree of sovereignty, and that, therefore, the
                                British were, to that extent, correct in their interpretation of our
                                continental shelf declaration. The Legal Division, however, felt
                                that for practical and political reasons it would be wiser to avoid
                                the word “sovereignty”. He felt that a declaration of jurisdiction
                                would be effective in excluding parties alien to the Persian Gulf
                                from asserting rights there.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Maclean said that the Foreign Office position had been that the
                                continental shelf was <hi rend="italic">res nullius</hi> and that no
                                one could assert any rights over such common property without
                                declaring sovereignty over it. Mr. Looney replied that fish were
                                also considered <hi rend="italic">res nullius</hi>, but that it was
                                the Department’s belief that jurisdiction and control could be
                                applied over fish and that such an application would be fully
                                effective in assuring rights for the party making the assertion, and
                                that the British Government had shown a degree of acquiescence in
                                the American position. Mr. Maclean pointed out that he felt the
                                question of petroleum was slightly different from that of fish,
                                inasmuch as riparian rulers would be most anxious to be quite
                                certain that they had full property rights over petroleum. He asked
                                Mr. Looney if jurisdiction and control would insure such property
                                rights. Mr. Looney replied that he felt such rights would not
                                necessarily be insured but, as a practical matter, they could be.
                                Mr. Jones further remarked that the British felt that fish and
                                petroleum were quite different phenomena in the sense that petroleum
                                was a fixed and stationary phenomenon, whereas fish were
                                migratory.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Boggs said that he felt the whole question of assertions of
                                rights over the continental shelf was a very complicated one,
                                especially from a geographer’s point of view, since it was quite
                                difficult to determine exactly where the continental shelf might lie
                                and since no matter where it lay it might not be possible, despite
                                all modern methods of exploitation, actually to conduct petroleum
                                exploitation throughout the shelf. Such factors as storms and
                                currents would make it difficult to exploit everywhere on the shelf,
                                since it might not be possible to station the necessary drilling
                                apparatus at all desired points. Therefore, he felt that no ruler
                                could hope to assert full sovereignty over it, inasmuch as he would
                                be prevented by natural factors from implementing his
                                sovereignty.</p>
                            <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0049"/>
                            <p>Mr. Jones said that, whereas this might be true, it would
                                nevertheless be necessary for any oil company receiving a concession
                                in the given area to know with certainty that it would have the
                                right to drill in that area. Mr. Boggs reiterated that he felt it
                                was most necessary to be careful in any statements made concerning
                                the shelf, which covers 11,000,000 square miles beneath the high
                                seas, a very large area. He felt that it was the size of the total
                                world continental shelf, for one thing, which made it wise to assert
                                rights only over the natural resources of the shelf rather than over
                                the shelf as a whole.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Maclean said that it was somewhat difficult for him to understand
                                the meaning of the word “appertaining”, the US desire to avoid use
                                of “sovereignty”, and the bearing of fisheries questions upon the
                                continental shelf problem. Mr. Hare said that he quite agreed that
                                the US positions seemed somewhat obscure but that it was nonetheless
                                of importance to the Department to maintain those positions. He
                                agreed that the British were correct in saying that a nation must
                                possess “sovereignty” before being able to exercise jurisdiction.
                                However, the Department felt it necessary to avoid an expression of
                                the word “sovereignty”. Mr. Boggs, however, said that he believed
                                there was a genuine distinction between the concepts of
                                “sovereignty” and “jurisdiction,” and that jurisdiction could be
                                exercised to affect something over which a nation did not have
                                “sovereignty”.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jones then remarked that he believed the Department’s position
                                was one of anxiety lest a declaration of sovereignty over the seabed
                                might lead to a declaration of sovereignty over the high seas. Mr.
                                Gray said that this was the case, and that it was especially
                                unfortunate that the President’s declarations were issued both on
                                the same day, thus necessarily linking them in the eyes of most
                                observers.</p>
                            <p>(In aside conversations with Mr. Hare, Mr. Boggs, and Mr. Gray during
                                the course of the above discussion, Mr. Dunn suggested that the
                                “sovereignty”–“jurisdiction” controversy might be resolved by
                                abandoning both words in favor of the following: “declares its title
                                to and its exclusive right to regulate the exploitation of the
                                natural resources, etc.” The suggestion was approved. It was
                                decided, however, that the above substitute wording would not be
                                proposed to the British unless the Foreign Office, proved adamant in
                                its refusal to accept “jurisdiction and control.”)</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hare suggested that, inasmuch as the American side had made clear
                                to the British representatives the Department’s position regarding
                                the problem of “sovereignty,” it would then be in order for the
                                meeting to consider certain other points. One of these was a
                                suggestion made by Mr. Sanger to the effect that it might be
                                advisable to delete from the draft proclamation a reference to the
                                high seas of “the <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0050"/>Persian
                                Gulf,” changing the reference to simply the “high seas” contiguous
                                to one of the riparian nations, wherever the seas might lie. This
                                might be advisable because certain of the nations involved in a
                                Persian Gulf division might also have “continental shelf” in the
                                Gulf of Oman, These nations would be Iran, Trucial Oman and Muscat
                                and Oman, and it would seem wise for them to assert rights over
                                “continental shelf” contiguous to all of their shores rather than
                                merely to their shores on the Persian Gulf. In addition Saudi Arabia
                                might have some “continental shelf” lying on the Red Sea. Mr. Jones
                                remarked that he felt the discussions so far had been confined to
                                the Persian Gulf “continental shelf”, and that the question of shelf
                                belonging to Persian Gulf States but lying outside of the Gulf had
                                not yet come up for consideration. Mr. Hare indicated, however, that
                                the American side would like to have the words “Persian Gulf”
                                removed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jones remarked that in the paragraph numbered 1(<hi rend="italic"
                                    >b</hi>) of Mr. Gray’s August 19 draft it was stated that the
                                transversal boundaries would be determined between rulers “in
                                accordance with fair and equitable procedures.” He remarked that the
                                British draft had not referred to any such procedures but had
                                suggested simply unqualified bilateral discussions between
                                neighbors. Mr. Jones felt the American wording suggested that the
                                bilateral agreements might be considered subject to review by third
                                parties as regards the fairness and equitableness of the agreements.
                                Mr. Boggs said that he felt the American language made it perfectly
                                possible for bilateral agreements to be reached but that it offered
                                the advantage of providing by implication an avenue of escape for
                                one of the two parties should serious difficulties arise in any
                                efforts to establish boundaries.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jones inquired if it would be desirable from the American point
                                of view for some kind of statement to be issued by the US and the UK
                                to American and British oil companies, once the final division of
                                the subsoil had been worked out by the riparian rulers. Mr. Mattison
                                said that it would be advisable for such a statement to be issued
                                but that the State Department would be most anxious to concert with
                                the Foreign Office before any statements were issued.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jones then asked if the American side had any other doubts or
                                reservations concerning the proposals which had been submitted by
                                the British Foreign Office. Mr. Mattison said that the Department
                                was somewhat concerned about the consequences of the British
                                suggestion that the UK unilaterally approach the Sheikhdoms under
                                their protection about three weeks in advance of the parallel US–UK
                                approaches to the other riparian states. The Department feared, for
                                example, that if the Sheikh of Kuwait were approached by the British
                                in this fashion in advance, King Ibn Saud might in some way or other
                                learn <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0051"/>of such an approach and
                                feel that he had been unfairly dealt with in not having been
                                consulted at the same time. Mr. Maclean said that he could
                                appreciate the difficulties and embarrassments which might arise
                                should something of this sort take place, but he believed that the
                                Foreign Office felt they were obliged, in view of their special
                                relations with the Sheikhs, to mention such a matter as this Persian
                                Gulf question to them in advance of any communication to the other
                                riparian states. He also said that apparently the Foreign Office was
                                anxious to insure that should Iran desire to take any unfavorable
                                action such as a declaration of Iranian rights on the western side
                                of the Persian Gulf (such as over Bahrein) the Foreign Office
                                considered it desirable that the Sheikhs be prepared in advance to
                                take action countering such possible Iranian action. Mr. Dunn said
                                that the State Department was not actually afraid that the Iranians
                                would take any such action as the British had in mind, but that the
                                State Department was seriously worried about the manner in which the
                                Iranian Government might react if any steps were taken about which
                                they had not been consulted. Mr. Dunn felt that the British
                                suggestion in Mr. Bromley’s letter to Mr. Mattison that the Iranians
                                be “warned” did not seem a desirable proposal. Mr. Jones said that
                                the Foreign Office was afraid that it would take the Sheikhs a long
                                time to achieve the necessary work involved in issuing their
                                declarations, and that this was another reason why the Foreign
                                Office desired to approach them in advance. Mr. Dunn said that
                                nonetheless he felt that all of the states should be approached
                                simultaneously. Mr. Jones said that although he recognized the
                                danger which Mr. Mattison had foreseen in terms of a “possible
                                leak”, from one of the Sheikhdoms to a ruler such as Ibn Saud, it
                                would nonetheless probably be difficult for the Foreign Office to
                                contemplate handling the situation any other way. Mr. Hare suggested
                                that possibly the Foreign Office might be able to inform British
                                representatives in the Sheikhdoms of what was being contemplated
                                without actually informing the local rulers themselves. Thus a great
                                deal of time might be saved from an administrative point of view,
                                and yet no approach would have been made to a Sheikh in advance of
                                the approaches to the other rulers. Mr. Jones said that he would
                                inquire about this possibility.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dunn said that if for any reason the Foreign Office did not
                                desire to participate directly in a parallel approach by the US and
                                the UK to the Iranian Government, the American Ambassador in Tehran,
                                to suit the convenience of British, might approach the Iranian
                                Government on behalf of the US and the UK. The Department would be
                                happy to arrange this, if it would make it easier for the British to
                                agree to an approach to Iran simultaneous with the approaches to the
                                other countries. Mr. Jones said that he appreciated this offer and
                                would report it to London.</p>
                            <pb n="38" xml:id="pg_38" facs="0052"/>
                            <p>Mr. Maclean said that he would transmit to London a copy of Mr.
                                Gray’s draft proclamation of August 19 together with a statement of
                                the points made by the Department in explanation of that draft to
                                him and to Mr. Jones at this meeting. He said that in addition Mr.
                                Jones would be leaving Washington for London on the 24th and he
                                would be able then to explain in person at the Foreign Office the
                                various positions taken by the State Department, Mr. Jones pointed
                                out again that the British were most anxious to arrive at a solution
                                to the whole problem as soon as possible, inasmuch as the various
                                oil companies involved were pushing Saudi Arabia to come to a
                                decision on the offshore concessions and the UK would be most
                                unhappy if the Saudis were to take any action which might not “fit
                                the bill,” in the eyes of the US and the UK.</p>

                            <p>On Thursday, August 26th, Mr. James Terry Duce, Vice President of the
                                Arabian-American Oil Company, and Mr. Philip C. Kidd, Manager of the
                                Washington Office of that firm, have an appointment with you. Their
                                reason for requesting this meeting is to review the development
                                programs of the Arabian-American Oil Company, Trans-Arabian Pipeline
                                Company, and the Mediterranean Refining Company which is jointly
                                owned by the California Texas Company and <gloss target="#t_Socony1"

                            <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0054"/>
                            <p>You will recall that it was decided in June to defer granting further
                                export licenses for the steel needed in the Trans-Arabian Pipeline.
                                One of the factors affecting this decision was instability in the
                                Middle East because of disturbances in Palestine. Certain persons in
                                the Department of Commerce and more particular, Sentaor Wherry of
                                Nebraska, had expressed the opinion that an equivalent amount of
                                steel (about 217,000 tons is now involved) should either be used for
                                tankers or for stimulating oil production in this Hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>The officials of <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss> have
                                brought out that the Mediterranean Refining Company is ready to
                                start work on a refinery at Sidon in Lebanon, and the Trans-Arabian
                                Pipeline Company wishes to continue with the construction of its
                                proposed pipeline from the oil coast in Saudi Arabia to Sidon. The
                                officials of the company also point out that the oil companies
                                operating in the Middle East will make available approximately one
                                billion dollars of foreign exchange to that area over the next five
                                years in the form of taxes, payments to local labor, total
                                purchases, royalties, transport charges, etc. They feel that this
                                constitutes a virtual “Marshall Plan for the Near East”, to be paid
                                for by American business rather than the American tax payer. In
                                their opinion this very substantial influx of foreign exchange into
                                the Near East should go a long way toward stabilizing the area.</p>
                            <p>It is believed that Mr. Duce and Mr. Kidd will expound this thesis to
                                you and propose it, along with various other arguments, as a reason
                                for the Department of State supporting the request of these oil
                                companies that the licencing of steel for their Near Eastern
                                requirements be approved early in September.</p>
                            <p>In the recent setback suffered by all American interests in the Near
                                East as a result of our stand on Palestine American business firms
                                have seemed to suffer less than either US Government or American
                                cultural interests in the area. It may well be therefore, that the
                                oil companies are in a position to recover lost ground in the Near
                                East sooner than US Government or other private interests.</p>
                            <p>Although we will probably not be in a position without further study
                                to reply to any specific proposals which may be brought up, it is
                                suggested that we should be receptive to any ideas which Mr. Duce
                                and his colleagues may put forward that would result in improving
                                the economic situation in the Middle East and thereby strengthen the
                                position of the United States in the area.<note n="1"

                                Jews, using stocks of crude at Haifa, it has been closed down.

                                substantial. The cooperation of Arabs and Jews, which would be
                                necessary to the operation of the refinery, would provide an
                                important precedent for cooperation in other matters.</p>

                            <p>The United States Government has since early in May been in close
                                touch with the British, representatives of the Provisional
                                Government of Israel, interested oil companies, and the

                                reopening of the refinery on a basis agreeable to Arabs and Jews.
                                Efforts to date have not been successful. The chief obstacle to
                                agreement has been Iraqi reluctance to allow crude oil movements to
                                Haifa as long as the refinery is under Jewish control and to the
                                apparent Jewish reluctance to permit the degree of international
                                control of the refinery and its operation which will satisfy the
                                Iraqi wishes.</p>
                            <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0057"/>
                            <p>The Jewish position on the latter point is not entirely clear,
                                Provisional Government of Israel officials in Israel having
                                indicated an unwillingness to permit United Nations supervision or
                                control of the refinery while a Provisional Government of Israel
                                spokesman in the United States had said such control would be
                                acceptable. A clarification of this point is being sought. The
                                United States Government believes an essential part of any agreement
                                regarding operation of the Haifa refinery is an undertaking by the
                                Jews that any production will be distributed on an historical basis
                                to Arab States as well as Israel. It is not clear whether
                                distribution on this basis would be acceptable to the Provisional
                                Government of Israel in the event refinery operations were as little
                                as 25 or 30 per cent of capacity.</p>
                            <p>The French have urged in an <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of
                                August 26<note n="4" xml:id="d27fn4">Not printed.</note> that the
                                difficulties of effecting a settlement involving international
                                control or supervision of the refinery be recognized and that
                                efforts be directed at present to securing the use of the pipe line
                                for export of crude oil from Haifa. It has been pointed out to the
                                French that the proposal seemed unrealistic in its failure to
                                provide for the petroleum needs of Israel. The Provisional
                                Government of Israel would probably be reluctant to surrender the
                                bargaining power given by control of Haifa until Israel’s petroleum
                                needs had been assured. It was further suggested that oil companies
                                which formerly distributed products in the area might be willing to
                                guarantee regular deliveries of products sufficient for current
                                consumption, as indicated by the Mediator, in return for their
                                shares of crude from the line. Preliminary work on the proposal is
                                being undertaken in order that it may be advanced promptly if it is
                                determined that operation of the refinery on a basis agreed by Iraq
                                and Israel is impossible at this time.</p>
                            <p>The Provisional Government of Israel has indicated that, in the event
                                crude oil for the refinery cannot be obtained from Iraq, it would
                                prefer to provide for Israel’s petroleum needs by importing crude
                                oil by tanker for operation of the refinery rather than by importing
                                petroleum products. It is attempting, therefore, to arrange tanker
                                imports of crude oil. The United States Government has been of the
                                opinion that operation of the refinery, using crude oil imported by
                                tanker, could only be at a small fraction of capacity and with
                                jeopardy to the more important objective of Arab-Jewish cooperation
                                for normal operation of the refinery.</p>

                                do anything to raise Bahrein question in any international forum;
                                (2) US–UK should continue discourage Iran from raising it in any

                                necessity should arise we would be prepared make parallel formal
                                approach with UK to Iranian Govt along following lines: (1) In our
                                opinion, Iranian claim is wholly untenable both on political and
                                legal grounds; (2) we believe raising Bahrein question would lead to
                                undesirable and fruitless disagreement with US and UK, have markedly
                                unfavorable repercussions in Arab States, and would redound only to
                                benefit of USSR; (3) if Iran should raise Bahrein question before
                                any international forum, we would be obliged strenuously to oppose
                                Iranian claim. While we would not so inform Iran, we would be
                                prepared introduce or support resolution in UN requesting <gloss

                                take case to UK.</p>
                            <p>In our opinion contemplated approach to Iran should not be made
                                unless occasion arises necessitating such action. However, when
                                US–UK proposal re division submarine area Persian Gulf is made known
                                to Iran, it is not unlikely that Iranian official or unofficial
                                reaction may precipitate situation in which contemplated US–UK
                                aproach would be essential. Dept would therefore appreciate urgent
                                comments re proposed reply to UK and suggested US–UK approach to

                                    Thomas C. Blaisdell was Acting Assistant Secretary of
                                    Commerce.</note> it was recommended that the consideration of
                                export licenses sought by the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company for the
                                shipment of main line pipe to Saudi Arabia during the second and
                                third calendar quarters of 1948 be postponed until the first week of
                                September 1948.</p>
                            <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0060"/>
                            <p>The Department suggested postponement of consideration of the
                                licenses at the time because of the disordered situation in the
                                Middle East. There was, as you may recall, heavy fighting then going
                                on between the regular forces of the Jews and Arabs in Palestine and
                                it was not known whether the proposed temporary truce would be
                                accepted or, if accepted, whether it would become effective.</p>
                            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing circumstances, it appeared that it
                                would be possible to continue construction of the pipeline, using
                                the pipe on hand in the area, provided necessary materials other
                                than main line pipe could be exported from the United States to
                                Saudi Arabia. It was recommended by the Department of State,
                                therefore, that the postponement of consideration of the export of
                                main line pipe not prejudice the project license earlier renewed or
                                applications by the company for licenses to export material other
                                than heavy pipe which would be required to continue the construction
                                of the pipeline.</p>
                            <p>The Department of State was gratified to learn that the
                                recommendations of the Advisory Committee of the Department of
                                Commerce were substantially in accord with those made by the
                                Department of State and that the Secretary of Commerce, acting on
                                the advice of the Advisory Committee approved the Committee’s
                                recommendations.</p>
                            <p>In these circumstances the Department of State, with the concurrence
                                of the other interested government agencies, felt that the
                                postponement of decision regarding heavy pipe exports would be the
                                proper course to follow until the situation clarified. As you may
                                recall the Jews and Arabs subsequently agreed to the temporary
                                truce; the United Nations assigned the role of Mediator to Count
                                Bernadotte; the United Nations Security Council ordered the Jews and
                                Arabs to cease fighting and an indefinite truce is now in
                                effect.</p>
                            <p>It is now evident that additional tonnage of main line pipe must be
                                exported in the fourth calendar quarter of 1948 if construction of
                                the Trans-Arabian pipeline is to be continued and completed in 1950.
                                Failure to approve export licenses for pipe to be shipped during
                                this quarter will mean the disbanding of the pipeline organization
                                which it has taken two years to assemble and will entail the
                                cessation of construction work on the project. Work could not be
                                resumed anew until a new organization is assembled, contractual
                                arrangements concluded for sources of pipe and equipment and
                                shipping schedules arranged, with accompanying costly and indefinite
                                delay.</p>
                            <p>In light of the developments pertaining to the effectuation and
                                maintenance of an indefinite truce and because of the importance of
                                the project, it is believed that steps should now be undertaken
                                which <pb n="47" xml:id="pg_47" facs="0061"/>will prevent the
                                abandonment of the project in terms of disbanding the construction
                                organization and the indefinite cessation of construction work.</p>
                            <p>The oil of the Middle East is an important factor in the success of
                                the European Recovery Program and in the continued prosperity of
                                Europe. This project when completed will provide a vital
                                transportation link in moving to Western Europe under the most
                                economic conditions increased quantities of Middle East oil of which
                                production is rapidly being expanded. The failure to provide exports
                                of heavy pipe in the last quarter of this year would undoubtedly
                                prevent the completion of the project until after the period of the
                                Recovery Program. The project when completed will also be of
                                substantial benefit in relieving the demand on the oil resources of
                                the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                            <p>An important additional consideration is that the completion of the
                                project would provide the area with substantial revenues to be
                                derived from the construction and operation of the pipeline and of
                                the proposed refinery at the Mediterranean terminus. These revenues
                                would constitute an important financial stabilizing factor to the
                                relatively limited economies of the countries in the area.
                                Furthermore, the continued construction of the pipeline might be
                                expected to create an atmosphere which would contribute to the
                                maintenance of the truce and a peaceful settlement and also off-set
                                certain disruptive tendencies conducive to the spread of
                                communism.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing and bearing particularly in mind the
                                benefits to the United States and Western Europe, as well as to the
                                Middle East which would derive from the completion of the pipeline,
                                it is the opinion of the Department of State that the abandonment of
                                the project would not be in the national interest. It is therefore
                                recommended that applications for the export of main line pipe to
                                Saudi Arabia for the Trans-Arabian pipeline be approved for the
                                fourth quarter of 1948.</p>

                                Administration concur in this recommendation. The National Military
                                Establishment is presenting its views to the Department of Commerce

                                terms of the company’s concession. The negotiations, “conducted in a

                                terminated on October 13.</p>

                                    reaction here very much in my opinion. Iran Government might

                            </p>
                            <p>In my opinion this procedure is very close to previous plan of
                                presenting Iran with “fait accompli” against which Department argued
                                so forcefully. Iran is to be presented with Anglo-American
                                “suggestion” which involves establishing 900 mile boundary line for
                                Iran. Iran is by all odds the riparian state most concerned in
                                division of Gulf but she is apparently not going to be asked to
                                agree plan or even to present her views. Simultaneously, other
                                riparian states all of whom are subject to direct or indirect
                                influence of UK–US Governments will make declaration implementing
                                suggested plan.</p>
                            <p>It is my considered opinion that Iranians will regard this course of
                                action as US–UK “imperialism”. At the minimum it will create most
                                unpleasant situation which will certainly not be helpful in our
                                current negotiation for renewing military mission contract. It could
                                even undermine present political orientation of Iran. It will surely
                                be excellent grist for Soviet propaganda mill. As Department is
                                aware Iranians are highly sensitive to their rights in Persian Gulf
                                and Bahrein issue has been foremost in Iranian nationalistic
                                agitation.</p>
                            <p>Am afraid that question of sub-sea resources in Gulf will be handled
                                in a manner that may seriously prejudice our broader interests here.

                                are of interest to oil companies circumscribed so as to give minimum
                                offense to Iran. Concessions could delineate limited areas open to
                                immediate drilling and provide for later inclusion waters over which
                                sheikdoms may <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0065"/>eventually have
                                jurisdiction. This should satisfy oil companies as I understand they
                                are not immediately interested in water deeper than 100 feet. As
                                need for overall division Gulf waters becomes more evident Iran
                                could be invited to participate in proceedings on equal footing she

                            <p>(1) It was suggested by the American members present that, to meet
                                substantial objections raised by our Ambassador in Tehran, our
                                proposed plan of approach to the governments of the littoral states
                                should be amended so as to provide that the Saudi Arabian Government
                                be informed first and that the other littoral states, including the
                                Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, be approached (not necessarily
                                simultaneously) from two to seven days thereafter. We would then
                                merely inform the governments of Iraq and Iran of our submission of
                                advice to the Saudi Arabian Government at its request, and we would
                                not make any recommendations to them as to similar action on their
                                own part unless specifically so requested by those governments.</p>
                            <p>The British representatives present expressed some concern that under
                                the new plan more time would not be allowed to notify the Sheikhdoms
                                but agreed to submit this proposal to the United Kingdom.</p>
                            <p rend="center">
                                <hi rend="smallcaps">press release</hi>
                            </p>
                            <p>(2) It was agreed that we should proceed on the assumption that one
                                or more governments would, within a reasonable time after our
                                submitting advice to Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdoms issue a
                                proclamation along the lines suggested. If inquiries should come in
                                from oil companies between the date of submission of advice and the
                                date of issuance of the proclamation by one of the governments of
                                the littoral states, the fact that such advice had been given would
                                be confidentially <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0069"/>revealed
                                and inquirers referred directly to <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                    >SAG</gloss> for information. If a considerable delay were
                                involved, this policy might be reviewed at a later date.</p>
                            <p>Press inquiries should be met by replies to the effect that our
                                advice has been requested and given, but that until <gloss
                                    target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> has made its decision we are not
                                free to comment upon details. When a proclamation is issued by some
                                Persian Gulf Government, we would issue no press release but confine
                                ourselves to frank answers to specific questions.</p>
                            <p>(3) It was agreed that a small-scale, rough map would be prepared as
                                soon as possible and suggested median and boundary lines marked
                                thereon in pencil. Copies of these maps should be sent to all
                                interested posts.</p>
                            <p>(4) Translations of the official English text into Arabic and Persian
                                should be prepared at the posts for submitting at the same time as
                                the English text.</p>

                                for trial this month. Mr. Harding believed that despite the

                                The sole stumbling block was Mr. Gulbenkian<note n="3"

                                object to elimination of the restrictive provisions of the red line
                                agreement and was making various other demands, including claims to
                                payment for “flexibility oil”, payment of certain royalties in
                                dollars (which the non-American partners of <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                    >IPC</gloss> would find difficult to meet), extension of the

                                concessions, etc. Mr. Harding said the other partners were in solid
                                agreement and were making a new approach to Mr. Gulbenkian offering
                                substantial compromises to most of his demands. He intimated,
                                however, that the partners would stand firm on the matter of
                                eliminating the restrictive provisions of the red line
                                arrangement.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Harding felt they were very close to settlement with Mr.
                                Gulbenkian and he sincerely hoped the case would not go to court,
                                for should there be a great deal of publicity surrounding the trial,
                                disturbing international repercussions might result. The case was
                                being tried on the issue of whether the red line agreement has
                                become invalid on the basis of the British Trading with the Enemy
                                Act and would hinge partially on whether the French partner, <gloss
                                    target="#t_CFP1">CFP</gloss> (Compagnie Française des Pétroles),
                                had collaborated with the Axis. Certain high French officials, in
                                particular, were bound to be involved and this, in turn, might cause
                                some embarrassment between the French and the other partners.</p>
                            <p>During the course of the conversation the question of reopening the
                                pipeline to Haifa was also touched upon, Mr. Harding stating he
                                personally believed little could be accomplished in this direction
                                until the UN acted on the Palestine question and made provision for
                                the future operation of the Haifa refinery. The Iraqis were being
                                very intransigent in the entire matter despite the fact that they
                                were losing approximately one-half of their royalties from the
                                shutdown. His company was planning, however, on the basis that the
                                pipeline would be re-opened after the first of the year.</p>

                                        practice initiated by US proclamation Sept 25, 1945 in which

                                        However, failure of one or more Gulf states issue a

                                reaction of London before giving him any final reply on the subject
                                of the proposed changes.</p>
                            <p>In further discussion Mr. Bromley said that the Foreign Office had
                                been happy to learn that we had advised <gloss target="#t_Aramco1"

                                restrictions were met. He said that the Foreign Office was anxious
                                that we should work out a, schedule on dates so that there would be
                                no question but that <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> was the
                                first Government approached about this matter. He concluded by

                                regard to timing and procedures, had not yet been forthcoming from

                                    signed these agreements on November 3. The agreements terminated
                                    the litigation and continued the relationship between the
                                    partners established by the Group Agreement of 1928, with

                                    partners also abandoned any right to participate in the American
                                    partners’ purchases of “Red Line” crude oil and products or to
                                    any damages as a result of these purchases. <p>The documents

                                        filed with the letter of December 16, that the summary in
                                        this footnote has been prepared (800.6363/12–1648).</p>
                                </note> and to answer any questions regarding the provisions of the
                                agreements.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Harding began by referring to the cooperation on the part of the
                                various members of <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>. In his view
                                the cooperation was at the highest level it has ever attained and is
                                particularly striking in the case of the French who have in the past
                                been very critical of the <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>
                                operations. It was noted that the major parties to the old Red Line
                                Agreement had reached an accord on a new agreement some months ago
                                and the main difficulty since then had been with Mr. Gulbenkian who
                                holds the minority interest in <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                >IPC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>In the renegotiation differences of opinion concerned two points in
                                particular, 1) the elimination of the restrictive clauses of the Red
                                Line Agreement, and 2) addition of a provision under which parties
                                to <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0079"/>the agreement could, if
                                they so desired, acquire greater than proportionate shares of oil
                                produced by <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and its
                                subsidiaries.</p>
                            <p>The first point was the most difficult from Gulbenkian’s viewpoint.
                                Since he is not directly engaged in oil production or marketing, he
                                views his <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> interest as an
                                investment, a principal source of revenue. He was fearful that the
                                removal of the restrictive clauses would lead to his being
                                manoeuvred out of his 5 per cent interest in <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                    >IPC</gloss>. However, negotiations were finally successful and
                                the only restrictive covenant left concerns concessions terminated
                                against the wishes of the company. In this case parties to the
                                agreement are obligated for five years from the date of termination
                                of a concession to seek its recovery for the interests of all
                                parties. Other than this there is complete freedom regarding the
                                right of the parties to acquire new concessions in the area or to
                                acquire new interests in existing concessions as in the case of
                                    <gloss target="#t_Socony1">Socony</gloss> and Jersey
                                participation in <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>The French were particularly concerned with the second point
                                mentioned above. Under the new agreement the old arrangement of
                                sharing oil on a proportionate basis will apply until 1952, a date
                                selected because of the anticipated completion of <gloss
                                    target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss>’s thirty-inch pipe line in that
                                year. Beginning in 1952 requests can be made for whatever quantity
                                of oil a group company wants. This policy will lead to uneven
                                takings since some companies will require more and others less than
                                their proportionate share. Requirements are to be tabled five years
                                ahead of time. However, requirements through 1957 are shown in a
                                schedule attached to the agreement.</p>
                            <p>Under the foregoing procedure, under taking companies are required to
                                sell to over takers at a so-called half way price, i.e., half way
                                between <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> cost (taxable cost plus
                                one shilling a ton) and market price. This procedure was adopted in
                                recognition of the right of the under taking companies to
                                compensation for capital invested and risk taken but at less than
                                full returns since they were not faced with the costs and
                                difficulties of marketing for which the over taker should be
                                compensated.</p>
                            <p>If the tabled requirements are greater than total production the
                                Managing Director will cut the requirements back

                            <p>Gulbenkian, not being in a position to take over “flexibility oil”
                                (i.e., overtakings beyond basic proportions) since he was not in the
                                oil marketing business, was given special treatment. In lieu of
                                flexibility oil he will get for fifteen years 250,000 tons per year
                                above his basic share. Thereafter he gets his basic share. His oil
                                will be sold to the major groups at market price. His basic share
                                will be obtained at <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> cost and his
                                special flexibility oil will be acquired at the half way price. His
                                250,000 tons extra is supposed to become available beginning in 1952
                                but there is provision for postponement provided Gulbenkian still
                                gets fifteen times 250,000 tons of oil prior to 1966.</p>
                            <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0080"/>
                            <p>Another feature of interest to Gulbenkian involved the question of
                                payment for his oil. Under the old agreement Gulbenkian was paid for
                                his oil in pounds or in a currency of his choice. He sold to the
                                major groups and when he requested dollars they were usually able to
                                obtain them from their governments.</p>
                            <p>Under the new agreement Gulbenkian can sell other than to the majors
                                if he so desires in the event they are unable to provide the
                                currency of his choice. For 1949 he has been guaranteed dollars for
                                all of his oil for which he may pay <gloss target="#t_IPC1"
                                    >IPC</gloss> in sterling. Thereafter Hear East Development will
                                pay him dollars for any purchases by <gloss target="#t_NEDC1"
                                    >NEDC</gloss>. In addition, STDC [<gloss target="#t_NEDC1">
                                    <hi rend="italic">NEDC</hi>
                                </gloss>] has guaranteed his profits in dollars on the special
                                flexibility oil for fifteen years.</p>
                            <p>Gulbenkian wanted the majors to buy his oil in perpetuity but he
                                compromised on the fifteen year basis. After fifteen years there is
                                no obligation on majors to take his oil and Gulbenkian will be
                                obliged to market as best he can.</p>
                            <p>In the matter of requirements no group can table requirements in
                                excess of five-sevenths of the two lower requirements or in excess
                                of 25 per cent above its takings in the previous five years. Only
                                when the total requirements are in excess of capacity will a company
                                be unable to get what it wants, but there are provisions for
                                expanding production provided the additional quantities needed can
                                be economically produced and brought to market.</p>
                            <p>The agreement did not settle the question of French losses due to the
                                war, which is still to be arbitrated or settled in court.</p>
                            <p>The agreement is exceedingly complex and in its final form an attempt
                                will be made to simplify it. However, the agreement as it stands is
                                a complete and binding contract which does not require the
                                additional action contemplated.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Harding and Harden offered to answer any inquiries which
                                subsequent study of the agreement might suggest.</p>

                            <p>Iraqi Prime Minister Muzahem Pachachi addressed the Chamber of
                                Deputies on December 27, 1948, concerning the question of reopening
                                the pipeline to Haifa. He noted that the Iraqi Government had
                                rejected a request by the Iraq Petroleum Company to permit the
                                pumping of oil to Haifa to supply neighboring countries including
                                Lebanon and Transjordan. The <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> had
                                then made a second request to permit pumping of oil to Haifa “for
                                direct shipment to Europe, and suggested a plan whereby Iraqi
                                observers could accurately control the flow of crude through the
                                pipeline direct to the tankers for export. It stated its willingness
                                to guarantee that not a drop of Iraqi oil would be diverted to the
                                Zionists.</p>
                            <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0081"/>
                            <p>“Subsequently representatives of three great powers having an
                                interest in <gloss target="#t_IPC1">IPC</gloss> and much concerned
                                with the success of the Marshall Plan, requested the Government to
                                give appropriate consideration to the company’s appeal. The response
                                of your Government was that it could never agree to a request which
                                might be beneficial to Jews. Later, the Company submitted
                                clarifications of its previous assurances which are now being
                                examined by the Ministry of Economics. To date no decision has been
                                taken, and none can be favorably decided upon until the Government
                                is fully satisfied that the Zionists at Haifa, shall not derive any
                                benefit whatsoever from Iraqi oil.” (enclosure to despatch 367,

                            <p>Mr. Bromley said that in a further telegram from London the Foreign
                                Office again questioned the legality of the proposed plan to assist
                                the littoral states of the Persian Gulf in establishing their
                                offshore boundaries in that body of water. He said that no final
                                decision on this question was likely to be reached by the British
                                Government for three weeks but that since the American Government is
                                also reconsidering its position he did not feel this delay would be
                                too serious.</p>
                            <p>Like the US, the British Government was worried over the effect of
                                proclamations defining boundaries of the Persian Gulf littoral
                                states on Persia. London recognized that further delay might
                                complicate the situation in view of the activity of various oil
                                companies but the Foreign Office felt that such complications were
                                less undesirable than the hasty pushing forward of plans that might
                                lead to internal political trouble in Iran, trouble which might be
                                exploited by the Russians.</p>
                            <p>London suggested that if the US and Great Britain felt it necessary
                                at this time to approach the littoral states of the Persian Gulf, we
                                make the following suggestions:— <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>We feel that, while the countries involved may, if they
                                        wish, talk with interested oil companies, it would be
                                        undesirable for the time being for any of these countries to
                                        commit themselves with any particular company or to extend
                                        their boundaries into the Persian Gulf.</item>

                                    <item>At the same time, the oil companies involved should be
                                        told not to press the littoral governments for offshore
                                        concessions until it is known how their claims fit into the
                                        proposed new boundaries.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>Although not desirable at this time, the US and British Governments
                                do not object if the oil companies make conditional agreements
                                regarding concessions with the Persian Gulf states provided these
                                agreements are neither formalized nor proclaimed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bromley said that this wire from London had crossed the Embassy’s
                                telegram containing Ambassador Wiley’s views on the Persian Gulf
                                offshore oil problem. Mr. Bromley ended by saying that the Embassy
                                would appreciate the reaction of the Department to this latest
                                telegram from London.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Bromley was told that it seemed highly doubtful that any
                                effective influence could be exercised on whether or not concessions
                                would be sought or granted, that perhaps the most that could be
                                accomplished would be to keep the agreements confidential. It was
                                indicated, though not given as a final answer, that since the London
                                proposals concerned only a three week period, they would seem
                                acceptable particularly as offshore negotiations did not seem likely
                                to reach final stages in that time.</p>

                                            term “support” is regarded in certain Divisions of the

                                            insufficiently specific to warrant such commitment. Such

                                            and the term “encouragement” is therefore believed to be

                            <p>1031. Apologizing for Foreign Office delay Burrows head Eastern
                                Department said today in connection with Department’s A–1 January 2
                                regarding social and economic affairs in Middle East that Foreign
                                Office accepts all Department’s amendments to memorandum with
                                exception changing second “support” in section 4<hi rend="italic"
                                    >d</hi>. Foreign Office believes that in connection with
                                application to International Bank “support” rather than
                                “encouragement” is intended.</p>
                            <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0086"/>
                            <p>2. Regarding distribution Burrows agrees with Department outline. He
                                understands Department has no objection to Foreign Office sending
                                memorandum to Sudan, Transjordan, Cyprus and other posts where there
                                are no US missions.</p>
                            <p>3. Burrows has no suggestions regarding US draft covering instruction
                                which he described as “admirable”. He finds number Department’s
                                additions “helpful” and said that in one form or another these would
                                be adopted by Foreign Office in preparing final draft British
                                instruction. Burrows assumes that Department’s instruction and
                                Foreign Office instruction need not be identical in phraseology
                                providing substance is same.</p>
                            <p>4. Burrows expects final clearance Foreign Office instruction and
                                necessary typing can be completed by March 20 and said that any time
                                after that date Foreign Office will be in a position to send out its
                                instructions. However, before taking this action Burrows promised to
                                await word from Department when its instruction would be ready. He
                                thinks that while US and British instructions need not arrive
                                simultaneously it would be preferable for them to reach a particular
                                post “within a fortnight.”</p>

                                approval and the Department has been informed through the Embassy at
                                London that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have
                                likewise endorsed the principles and recommendations embodied in the
                                Memorandum. Accordingly this Memorandum is to be considered by the
                                United States Missions and Consulates in the Middle East as
                                indicating the current views and objectives of the United States

                                discussed therein. It is intended to serve as general guidance for
                                the official representatives of this Government in that area in the
                                conduct of relations with Middle East countries with reference to
                                matters lying within the general scope of the Memorandum.</p>
                            <p>Your attention is particularly called to the close harmony and
                                identity of views and objectives on the part of the Government of
                                Great Britain and of the United States as revealed by this
                                Memorandum. In this sense the Memorandum constitutes a sequel to the

                            <p>Accordingly, I desire that you give careful study to the enclosed
                                Memorandum and review it point by point with your British colleague,
                                who will be receiving a copy of the Memorandum with corresponding
                                instructions from the Foreign Office at about the same time. You
                                should seek to reach early agreement with your British colleague as
                                to the manner in which the principles and recommendations outlined
                                in the Memorandum should be applied in your area. You should inform
                                the Department if any of these principles or recommendations seem
                                inapplicable in the peculiar circumstances at your post, and of any
                                additional points which you consider should be incorporated in line
                                with the general spirit of frank interchange of views and harmonious

                            <p>In as much as a joint review of this nature with your British
                                colleague may be regarded as a continuation of comparable
                                discussions requested by the instruction of May 1944, referred to in
                                the third paragraph of this Instruction, some of the points covered
                                by the enclosed Memorandum may already have been covered in
                                Anglo-American discussions at your post. If so, you will doubtless
                                find it useful to examine what practical results were derived from
                                your earlier discussions, to what extent the discussions you are now
                                to have can be based on this earlier foundation, and to what extent
                                they will break <pb n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0090"/>new ground.
                                The Department will be particularly interested in receiving a report
                                on these matters from you in due course.</p>
                            <p>For your guidance in discussions with your British colleague and in
                                connection with all other action you may have occasion to take with
                                reference to which the contents of the enclosed Memorandum and of
                                this instruction may have some bearing, I wish to emphasize that the
                                essential significance of the Memorandum relates to the general
                                principles and spirit which characterize it rather than to specific
                                details. The memorandum is not a formal and final declaration of
                                specific United States policy, and does not cover inclusively all
                                matters of interest to the United States with reference to social
                                and economic affairs in the Middle East. It is not to be taken as
                                indicating any intention to impose a concerted or collusive
                                Anglo-American program or policies in the area. It does not imply
                                any intention whatsoever to recognize British or American or
                                British-American spheres of economic influence in the area as a
                                whole or in any part of the area, nor to exclude or undermine the
                                legitimate and constructive influence of other like-minded nations.
                                There is no desire to develop or promote restrictive, exclusive or
                                discriminatory policies or lines of action, for, as is clearly
                                brought out in the Memorandum itself, the views interchanged implied
                                no departure from the liberal principles of international economic
                                relations formulated in the draft Charter for an International Trade
                                Organization and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade signed in
                                Geneva on October 30, 1947.</p>
                            <p>The essential significance of the Memorandum lies in its recognition
                                of the harmony and identity of British and American interest in the
                                raising of social and economic standards of the peoples of the
                                Middle East, as an effective contribution to human welfare and as
                                the most useful and desirable means of promoting the purposes and
                                interests of the United States and Great Britain through the
                                advancement of sound and stable social, economic and political
                                conditions in the area.</p>
                            <p>The primary objective of the Memorandum and purpose of this
                                instruction is to encourage and promote, among all United States
                                representatives in the Middle East as well as in Washington and
                                London who are concerned with social and economic affairs in the
                                Middle East, the general state of mind most conducive to harmonious
                                and constructive collaboration with their British colleagues toward
                                the progressive achievement of the broad ends envisaged, as outlined
                                in the Memorandum and in the foregoing remarks.</p>
                            <p>The contents of this secret Memorandum should be made known only to
                                those members of your staff who are actually involved in carrying
                                out the recommendations which it contains. You should however insure
                                that all appropriate members of your staff are made fully aware <pb
                                    n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0091"/>of and are guided by the
                                general spirit underlying it. I consider that the manner in which
                                this subject is brought to the knowledge of consular officials in
                                the outlying post within your area, namely Consulate at Basra, may
                                best be left to your discretion. Your procedure in this regard might
                                well be discussed with your British colleague following receipt by
                                him of corresponding instructions. Extra copies of the enclosed
                                Memorandum and of the instruction are included for your use in
                                communicating to the above mentioned consular post in your area.</p>

                                for irrigation and other economic development projects in Iraq, as
                                outlined in your memorandum of November 13, 1947 addressed to the
                                Director of the Office of Near Eastern and African Affairs. For your
                                convenience there is attached a copy of this memorandum, and of the
                                letter of November 7, 1947, addressed to the Foreign Minister of
                                Iraq by the Vice President of the International Bank for

                            <p>Particular note has been taken of your report that in several
                                important conversations which you had in Baghdad with the Iraqi
                                Prime Minister prior to your return to the United States last
                                September, you were informed of the Iraqi Government’s desire for
                                broad collaboration with the British and American Governments in the
                                formulation of a comprehensive and integrated overall plan for
                                development in Iraq and for its earliest possible realization. In
                                subsequent discussions in Washington participated in by important
                                officials of the Iraqi Government as well as by yourself, including
                                a meeting with the President and Vice President of the International
                                Bank, the establishment of an Iraq Development Planning Board, with
                                appropriate participation by British, American and International
                                Bank experts was envisaged as the appropriate vehicle through which
                                such collaboration might be afforded. It is noted in this connection
                                that, as stated in the letter of November 7 by the Vice President of
                                the International Bank, while the Bank could not consistently with
                                its policy <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0092"/>permit a member of
                                its staff to serve actively on such a Board, “thereby becoming a
                                party to the decisions of a body which would subsequently approach
                                the Bank with a request for finance”, the Bank would be prepared, at
                                its expense “from time to time to make available one or more
                                members” of the Bank’s staff “for consultation at the board’s
                                headquarters or at such other places as may be mutually

                            <p>The question raised by your report and recommendations in these
                                circumstances relates therefore to the readiness of the Government
                                of the United States to participate at the request of the Government
                                of Iraq and in collaboration with the Government of the United
                                Kingdom, in aiding in the formulation and realization of an overall
                                economic development program for Iraq through representation by
                                American experts on the proposed Iraq Development Planning Board. In
                                this connection it may be observed, as noted in your memorandum of
                                November 13, that the British Government’s interest in economic
                                development in Iraq and a favorable inclination toward
                                Anglo-American cooperation in reference thereto, has been expressed
                                more than once, notably in a memorandum winch the British Foreign
                                Minister transmitted to the Secretary of State on March 20,
                                    1947.<note n="2" xml:id="d52fn2">

                                based on a broad consideration of the subject, the Department has
                                consulted other interested agencies of this Government through the
                                Cabinet Food Committee. On the basis of this consultation the
                                Department is now able to advise you as follows: <list>

                                    <item>The Government of the United States views with sympathetic
                                        interest and approval the desire of the Government of Iraq
                                        to formulate, and proceed to the realization of, an overall
                                        plan for economic development centered upon irrigation and
                                        other agricultural projects in the area of the Tigris and
                                        Euphrates Rivers, designed to expand food production,
                                        control floods, and in other ways contribute to improvement
                                        in the standard of living of the people of Iraq.</item>

                                    <item>This Government would accordingly be prepared to give
                                        favorable consideration, at the Iraq Government’s request,
                                        to such measures of assistance for this purpose as may be
                                        practicable and appropriate. Specifically, it would be
                                        willing to consider the nomination of an American expert or
                                        experts, subject to such expert or experts being available,
                                        for service with an Iraq Development Planning Board as
                                        proposed. More precise determination of the American
                                        participation of this nature which would be found
                                        practicable and appropriate would of course have to await a
                                        specific request from the Iraq Government. It is assumed in
                                        this connection that timely consideration will also be given
                                        to enlisting, in appropriate circumstances, the assistance
                                        or advice of suitable international organizations such as

                                    <item>It would be understood that the nomination of such

                                        by it of any Iraq loan application to the International Bank
                                        would necessarily depend upon study and approval by the
                                        United States of technical and financial details of such
                                        final plans as may be presented.</item>

                            <p>It is the Department’s desire that you should, in such manner and on
                                such occasion as you find appropriate, express to the Iraqi
                                authorities the views of this Government as above outlined in
                                continuation of the conversations you have had with Iraqi officials
                                in Baghdad and Washington. In view however of the interest already
                                expressed to this Government by the British Government in this
                                general subject, in view further of the Iraq Government’s desire for
                                Anglo-American collaboration with it in the formulation of its
                                development program, and in view of this Government’s general policy
                                of maintaining the maximum harmony of action and fullest interchange
                                of views with the British Government in connection with Middle
                                Eastern affairs, the Department considers it important that there
                                should be a further exchange of views with the British Government
                                prior to your communicating this Government’s views to the Iraq
                                authorities.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly a copy of this instruction, together with its enclosures,
                                is being communicated to the American Ambassador in London, with the
                                request that he discuss the subject further with the appropriate
                                authorities of the British Government and explore with them the
                                desirability of similar and synchronized action on their part. It is
                                anticipated that the British Government will welcome such procedure
                                and instruct its representative in Iraq accordingly.<note n="3"
                                    xml:id="d52fn3">The Department, on March 29, transmitted a copy
                                    of instruction 17 and its enclosures to “Ambassador Douglas in
                                    instruction 121, noting that: <p>“The particular action
                                        envisaged in the attached instruction to Baghdad was
                                        informally discussed with that official (Mr. Greenhill), and
                                        it was then thought desirable that the action proposed
                                        should await the completion of the so-called Haigh survey of
                                        Iraq irrigation possibilities outlined in the attachment to
                                        Mr. Bevin’s memorandum (of March 20, 1947)
                                        above-mentioned.</p>
                                    <p>“In view, however, of the return of Ambassador Wadsworth to
                                        his post in Baghdad, it is felt that authorization to him to
                                        make appropriate response should not be further delayed. It
                                        is believed, in the light of the earlier discussions
                                        above-referred to that the Foreign Office will welcome the
                                        opportunity for harmonious and synchronized British and
                                        American action in the circumstances. Accordingly, it is
                                        requested that the subject be discussed with the appropriate
                                        officials of the Foreign Office. By this means, it is
                                        desired to afford the Foreign Office opportunity to cause
                                        such instructions as may be deemed desirable, to be sent to
                                        the British representative in Baghdad with a view to
                                        discussion of the subject with Mr. Wadsworth and the taking
                                        of such synchronized action as may be found useful and
                                        appropriate.” (890G.6113/3–2948)</p>
                                    <p>London, on May 26, transmitted to the Department, British

                                        4512/153/93 of May 16 to the American Embassy. The note
                                        deemed it “useless” to press the “care-taker” Government of
                                        Iraq to undertake development plans and considered that “The
                                        present crisis of affairs in Palestine would also render
                                        such action untimely.” The Foreign Office, however, welcomed
                                        joint United States-United Kingdom action to press the Iraqi
                                        Government to resume activity concerning development plans
                                        when a new and more stable government would be formed

                            <p>The Secretary of State refers to the Department’s information and
                                educational exchange program, and in response to inquiries received
                                from various missions concerned, has prepared the enclosed policy

                                    <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> to serve as a guide to the
                                Department’s information activities within certain countries of the
                                Near East.</p>
                            <p>The Department has been informally advised that the British Foreign
                                Office has issued a guidance on the question of cooperation with
                                United States field representatives in an anti-Communist publicity
                                program, and that this guidance has been sent to all British
                                missions concerned. The Department understands that the guidance
                                states that as a result of the various discussions that have taken
                                place it has been agreed that there should be a degree of
                                cooperation in this matter. It indicates that there has been an
                                agreement to exchange information and ideas where desirable without
                                any obligation on either side except when consultation has resulted
                                in agreement on a particular course of action.</p>
                            <p>The Department perceives no objection to the exchange of views with
                                corresponding British officers relative to our general policy in
                                this area inasmuch as it is to the Department’s advantage to receive
                                corresponding information concerning British plans and policy there.
                                It would however not be to the advantage of the government of the
                                United States to enter into any arrangement which gave the
                                appearance of joint action or that our activities were in any way
                                inspired by joint policy or a unified approach. The Department
                                therefore desires that complete independence of action and operation
                                be retained by responsible officers abroad in charge of our
                                information and educational <pb n="82" xml:id="pg_82" facs="0096"

                                officers in the Department.</p>
                            <p>The Officer in Charge is requested to make appropriate comments and

                                <p>It is probably not an exaggeration to say the US information
                                    program in the Arab States is faced with problems of
                                    unprecedented delicacy. In the space of a few short years the
                                    United States has fallen from a position of unequalled esteem,
                                    respect and honor in the attitudes of the peoples of the Arab
                                    world to one of embittered distrust and animosity.</p>

                                    period of nearly a century plus a somewhat long-range admiration
                                    of America’s accomplishments in peace and war were responsible

                                <p>As of the moment we must recognize that the Arab countries of the
                                    Hear East are convinced that America alone is primarily
                                    responsible for the success which has attended the establishment
                                    of the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> State of Israel in what
                                    is regarded as Arab territory. The part which other great powers
                                    have had in the past or present in bringing about that which is
                                    inimical to their interests has largely been forgotten in the
                                    wave of anger directed at the United States for her part in
                                    bringing about the present situation. Despite the role which the
                                    United Nations has played in the matter, even this international
                                    body has not taken very much of the curse off of the United
                                    States leadership and backing.</p>
                                <p>The problem therefore which is posed is: In view of this
                                    extremely unfavorable position of US prestige, what policy is to
                                    be pursued in <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0097"

                                <p>The sole remaining American associations which are regarded with
                                    any degree of tolerance and esteem are the American institutions
                                    engaged in educational pursuits and philanthropy and, secondly,
                                    American oil interests, chiefly because of the material benefit
                                    derived and the personal attitudes of Americans engaged in the
                                    business locally. There is a wide-spread tendency in the Arab
                                    world to divorce American foreign policy and its baneful aspects
                                    from individual Americans and American institutions within the

                            <p>Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy, in a statement before the Chamber
                                of Deputies on January 7, announced that his Government was
                                determined to pursue a policy for the immediate and unconditional
                                evacuation of British troops from Egypt. He also called for the
                                unity of the Nile Valley, denouncing the maintenance of the present
                                regime in the Sudan (airgram 19, January 12, from Cairo,
                                741.83/1–1248).</p>
                            <p>British Ambassador Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, after discussions at
                                London, returned to Cairo late in January. His instructions were to
                                suggest informal talks between British and Egyptian military
                                officials, to be held in Great Britain and in Egypt. The British
                                expectation was “to thus create informal joint defence board which
                                can begin to function before or without any formal establishment.
                                General strategy is to shift Anglo-Egyptian conversations to
                                technical and strategic problems as opposed to political problems
                                leaving latter to cool off.” (Telegram 275, January 23, 7 p. m.,
                                from London, 741.83/1–2348)</p>
                            <p>London advised, on March 18, that “To some degree British idea
                                separating military problems from conversations regarding Sudan was
                                successful for a time. British Embassy Cairo conducted some fairly
                                hopeful conversations on military topics … with King, Nokrashy and
                                other important Egyptians and point was reached when Egyptian
                                Government was about to propose visit to UK by Haider Pasha,
                                Minister of Defence. However, when recent storm blew up over draft
                                constitutional ordinance for Sudan, Nokrashy, ‘always rigid and
                                unforthcoming’ saw to it that military talks were put in abeyance.”
                                (Telegram 1127, 741.83/3–1848)</p>
                            <p>A spokesman for the British Foreign Office on October 19 stated that
                                Egyptian Foreign Minister Khashaba called on Secretary of State for
                                Foreign Affairs Bevin at Paris during the meeting of the United
                                Nations in that city. The Egyptian expounded the view that the
                                British could safely withdraw their forces from Egypt and rely on
                                bases in the Sudan, Transjordan and Cyrenaica. Mr. Bevin stated that
                                it was essential for the United Kingdom to have a headquarters <pb
                                    n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0100"/>and a base in Egypt during
                                peacetime so that they would be ready for use when war came. He
                                regarded the defense of Egypt as a joint Anglo-Egyptian problem and
                                queried whether the two countries might arrange technical defense
                                talks on such matters as increased training of Egyptians in the
                                United Kingdom, the supplying of arms by the United Kingdom and the
                                conversion of British headquarters in Egypt into Anglo-Egyptian
                                headquarters. If such talks were successful, the Treaty of 1936
                                might become redundant. Egyptian Ambassador Amr returned to Cairo
                                thereafter for consultations (telegram 4556, October 20, 1 p. m.,
                                from London, 741.83/10–2048).</p>
                            <p>London, on November 27, advised that Ambassador Amr had reported
                                success “in selling” Mr. Bevin’s idea of defense cooperation to the
                                King (telegram 5023, 741.83/11–2748). Then, on December 14, the
                                Foreign Office spokesman informed London that the Ambassador had
                                returned to London but had not attempted to see Mr. Bevin. The
                                spokesman deduced that a “hitch” had developed (airgram 2336,
                                December 15, from London, 741.83/12–1548). This development seemed
                                to be confirmed when Cairo reported, on December 14, that Prime
                                Minister Nokrashy had made a “strong statement to the Senate that
                                his Government’s attitude on the Sudan remained unchanged, and after
                                reaffirming that his Government would not start negotiations with
                                Great Britain unless such negotiations would assure the achievement
                                of Egypt’s demands, received a vote of confidence of 33 to 20”.
                                (Airgram 991, 848Z.00/12–1448)</p>
                            <p>The Department of State, during 1948, received a large volume of
                                reporting from London and Cairo on various aspects of the revision
                                of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and of the future status of the Sudan
                                but apparently refrained from any expression of opinion on these
                                issues.</p>
                            <p>Egypt and the Soviet Union signed a barter agreement on March 3,
                                calling for the exchange of 38,000 metric tons of long staple cotton
                                for 216,000 tons of wheat and 19,000 tons of corn cereals. A
                                protocol, signed simultaneously with the agreement, granted both
                                parties most-favored-nation treatment in trade relations with the
                                exceptions of countries adjacent to the Soviet Union and of the Arab
                                countries (telegram 228, March 4, from Cairo). The Department’s
                                reply of March 22 stated in part that “the question of trade
                                preferences has received considerable attention at the United
                                Nations Conference on Trade and Employment now in session at Habana.
                                . . . While the provisions relating to preferences in the proposed
                                Charter for an International Trade Organization have been modified
                                to some extent, they would not countenance such blanket exceptions
                                to most-favored-nation treatment as are apparently permitted in the
                                protocol under reference.” (airgram 83). These and related papers

                                        Govt to Iran on any large scale could be provided only by

                                        devoted attention to Iranian situation gives some hope that
                                        Congress might be favorably disposed. However, only

                                        would be to support Iranian independence in face of Soviet

                                        would be displeasing to many Iranians who are anxious avoid
                                        open break with USSR. Apart from this consideration, such
                                        open alignment of Iran in opposition to Soviet Union might
                                        deprive Iran Govt of opportunities for diplomatic maneuver,
                                        delaying tactics, conciliatory gestures, and the like which
                                        it has employed with considerable success in past. US might
                                        assume very serious responsibility if it encouraged Iran to
                                        burn its bridges in this fashion in view of fact we could
                                        not guarantee to protect it in event of Soviet

                                    <item>We believe US should be especially careful avoid any
                                        appearance of forcing loan or gift on Iran both because of
                                        adverse effect such appearance would have on Iranians, who
                                        are perhaps justifiably hesitant obligate themselves
                                        financially to foreign Govts, and because of plausibility it
                                        would lend to Soviet-inspired charges of American dollar

                                        initiative in discussion of special assistance to Iran from
                                        US should always be left to Iran Govt and we should make no
                                        move this regard without specific and formal request. It
                                        should also always be kept in mind that even if request were

                            <p>10. In my first official call on Prime Minister Hakimi today I
                                reviewed background of military credit, emphasizing that while we
                                did <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0105"/>not press our military
                                supplies on anyone, I felt I should press Iran Government for early
                                decision on question. Hakimi declared himself in favor of
                                ratification of credit and said he would press matter to Majlis
                                following receipt of vote of confidence.<note n="1" xml:id="d56fn1"
                                    >Tehran reported, on January 22, that the Iranian Prime Minister
                                    “repeated to press two days ago that government intended to buy
                                    10 million dollars worth of arms from US. Thus he has at least
                                    committed himself publicly to program. He is posing as watchdog
                                    of Iranian Treasury by having reduced American purchase from 25
                                    million dollars to 10 million dollars and has thereby escaped
                                    any great criticism for spending too much money on arms.”

                                emphasizing that we were anxious to assist Iran whenever possible
                                and that we maintained our missions here, despite urgent need for
                                American military personnel elsewhere, only as result of Iran
                                Government’s request and in desire to help develop Iran’s security
                                forces. I said that at any moment Iran Government desired
                                termination of these missions, they would leave promptly. I said I
                                felt I should say, to be entirely frank, that Iranian request for
                                withdrawal of American missions would be interpreted by American
                                public as lack of interest by Iran in American assistance, adding
                                that I did not mention this factor in order to urge retention of
                                advisors but merely to state a fact. Hakimi interrupted my statement
                                several times to assure me that he strongly desired retention of
                                American advisors and said Iran could turn nowhere else for
                                disinterested expert assistance.</p>
                            <p>At end of conversation Hakimi asked my views regarding
                                American-Soviet relations as they might affect Iran. I said that
                                while I could not pretend that there had been any improvement in our
                                relations with USSR, I personally thought situation was better now
                                than before London Conference since Iranians and everyone else at
                                least knew the exact position. Hakimi expressed view that only way
                                to deal with Soviets was to show strongest possible resistance to
                                their aggressive tactics everywhere and in every detail.</p>
                            <p>Hakimi gave every evidence of his thorough devotion to democratic
                                principles, and I believe him entirely sincere. If his forcefulness
                                were equal to his good intentions he would make outstanding Prime
                                Minister. His following in Majlis seems to be slightly increasing at
                                moment, and best expectation is that he may get fair-sized vote of
                                confidence within week.</p>

                                substantial agreement with <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss>
                                position, namely, that constitutional change does not appear
                                necessary prerequisite Iran’s rapid development and that proposed
                                grant greater power to Shah at this time might produce unwelcome
                                discord in Majlis and consequently increase confusion in present
                                Iranian political scene. We told Brit Emb that your views had not
                                been requested by Shah or Iranian Govt and that you would not, we
                                felt certain, volunteer any opinion in the premises.</p>
                            <p>Our tentative thinking on subject increased constitutional power for
                                Shah is along following lines: We recognize essentially unstable
                                nature of Iranian Govt and appearance of greater stability which
                                might accrue from increase of Shah’s constitutional power. At same
                                time, we do not believe that grant of power to Shah to dissolve
                                Majlis would enhance appreciably speed or certainty of reform and
                                development in Iran. In our view Majlis, by its very nature as
                                public forum of popular leaders, is inherently safeguard against
                                concerted foreign pressure upon any single source of power in Iran.
                                Any diminution of Majlis power in favor apparent one-man rule would
                                almost certainly evoke unsympathetic reaction on part American
                                public. In this connection, it should be noted that no European
                                monarch has constitutional power initiate dissolution parliament,
                                except in Sweden where such power has not been used in past
                                twenty-five years.</p>
                            <p>In addition above basic considerations, proposal for increase of
                                Shah’s prerogatives would probably cause internal controversy
                                welcome to predatory powers. Further, present Shah does not, in our
                                opinion, appear to have used, or to give promise of using, his
                                influence effectively to improve welfare Iranian people.</p>
                            <p>Above views are purely tentative and subject change on basis
                                additional Emb info and analysis. Would welcome your views this

                            <p>22. Comprehensive statement of Department thinking regarding aid to
                                Iran (<gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 5, January 3) has
                                been most timely and valuable. I concur in general policy expressed
                                and have been guided especially by paragraph 5 in my subsequent
                                conversations with Prime Minister and Shah.</p>
                            <p>Full discussion of telegram held at meeting yesterday with Embassy
                                staff and military advisors. Comments on few points in telegram may
                                be of value. As regards paragraph 3 we are inclined to think rather
                                more emphasis than desirable may be placed on whether Iranian army
                                is intended for internal security or for national defense. When our
                                thinking is based solely on Iranian army for internal security our
                                thoughts inevitably become apparent to Iranians, wounding their
                                pride and discouraging their self-confidence, which they need badly.
                                Improved Iranian army would be valuable both for internal security
                                and for national defense. It would of course be impossible to build
                                Iranian army to make substantial defense against USSR but stronger
                                army might have some effect on discouraging aggression or retarding
                                enemy progress for few vital days if we help to build
                                self-confidence along with supplying better arms.</p>
                            <p>As regards question of placing Iran in Greek-Turkish category (your
                                paragraph 4) this subject has many aspects. I concur that in <pb
                                    n="94" xml:id="pg_94" facs="0108"/>absence of ability to assure
                                Iran prompt support, we would assume considerable responsibility by
                                forcing Iran off fence onto our side. At same time, I am not certain
                                that policy of diplomatic maneuver, delaying tactics and
                                conciliatory gestures is desirable basis for foreign policy of Iran
                                or any other country when issue is totalitarian aggression against
                                democracy. Difference between American policy of support for Iranian
                                independence and Soviet policy here during past two years has been
                                difference between white and black, and everyone should recognize
                                it. Soviets are forever telling Iranians to beware of American
                                imperialism, and many Iranians who follow policy of balance or
                                neutrality swallow this line at least half way. They profess to see
                                no distinction between “Soviet imperialism” and “American
                                imperialism” and cry plague on both houses. Continued policy of
                                neutrality would result, if hostilities should come, in
                                disinterested attitude by Iranians who would regard conflict as
                                being between two imperialisms. Even now we face great difficulties
                                in strengthening Iran economically, since Iranians who follow policy
                                of balance hesitate to request economic aid from either side.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, for better or worse, Iran’s geographical location and
                                petroleum resources of Persian Gulf will make it impossible for Iran
                                to remain neutral in any future war and I am not certain we are
                                benefiting Iranians by encouraging them to hope they might. It is
                                entirely true that many, perhaps most, Iranians wish fervently that
                                all great powers, including US, would go away and leave Iran alone.
                                But no great power will or can abandon it to another. Stakes here
                                are too important. Since Iran must choose sides eventually, it
                                should be on side of freedom and independence. Sooner whole free
                                world is lined up clearly on that side, less likelihood there will
                                be of totalitarian aggression. I agree that we should avoid pushing
                                Iran off fence against her will. However we should emphasize to
                                Iranians in every possible way difference between American and
                                Soviet policy in Iran and should encourage Iran to show her
                                recognition of this difference and to realize that US and Iranian
                                interests are parallel.</p>

                                preoccupation with it.</p>
                            <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0110"/>
                            <p>I concur that amendment of constitution to give crown authority to
                                dissolve Majlis involves risk of abuse. I am not certain situation
                                is yet serious enough to require action by us or to justify fully
                                concern manifested by British or by Department but it bears
                                watching.</p>
                            <p>As long as Shah seeks change in constitution by entirely legal means,
                                it is difficult for us to find proper basis for injecting ourselves
                                into question and advice on our part whether solicited or not would
                                become known and would be construed by Iranians as interference in
                                internal matter, just as expression of views by foreign diplomat in
                                Washington on US constitutional amendment would be properly
                                resented. British inclination to give advice too frequently to Iran
                                in such matters in past has been important cause for deep-seated
                                resentment against them here.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, if we object to legitimate efforts of Shah to amend
                                constitution, we may unwittingly encourage illegitimate actions by
                                him or someone else.</p>
                            <p>Shah’s dissatisfaction with his position has grown, paradoxically,
                                with his greatly increased personal popularity and influence in Iran
                                during past 18 months. During first years of his reign, when foreign
                                troops were in Iran, he counted for very little and no one expected
                                anything of him. Today when he is by far most influential figure in
                                Iran, he is continually being urged by Iranians to do something
                                positive to remedy chaotic political and economic condition of
                                country. Yet he is aware that these same Iranians, who today lavish
                                expressions of devotion to him, would be first to call him dictator
                                if he took any steps which affect them personally, and he desires
                                legally-enacted constitutional amendment before putting pressure on
                                Majlis to carry out its functions.</p>
                            <p>I am not certain whether his desire for authority to dissolve Majlis
                                is best solution, but problem, at least at present, is primarily
                                Iranian one.</p>
                            <p>Majlis, as Department points out, is great safeguard of Iranian
                                independence and its continued existence and full legislative
                                authority is most important. At same time Majlis is almost entirely
                                negative body with no apparent ability to take positive action.
                                During six months of present Majlis, it has passed only two laws,
                                one refusing Soviet oil concession and another approving provisional
                                budget for two months. It has two or three short sessions a week and
                                spends most of time debating members credentials. There is no party
                                system to instill discipline and every member is on his own. Much
                                positive action is required of Majlis if Iran is to improve, since
                                executive in Iran has almost no authority to do anything under
                                constitution as now drawn. If Shah or someone else had power to call
                                for new elections, some sense of discipline might be instilled among
                                deputies, from fear of being dismissed. Tampering <pb n="97"
                                    xml:id="pg_97" facs="0111"/>with constitution is dangerous, and
                                I personally am hesitant about authority being placed in hands of
                                any hereditary monarch, but it would be difficult for us to sustain
                                allegation that any serious attack against democratic processes was
                                involved in Shah’s present proposals.</p>
                            <p>I have discussed situation with my British colleague on numerous
                                occasions. He perhaps views Shah’s proposals with slightly more
                                concern than I do, due possibly to fact that British interests in
                                Iran are different from ours. British are frightened by any
                                possibility of government in Iran strong enough to defy their
                                interests or make serious attack on their oil concessions. British
                                are concerned just as we are by continued failure of Iran to
                                accomplish any economic and political improvements which would give
                                genuine democracy chance to function here, but they may prefer
                                continuance of present unsatisfactory situation rather than run risk
                                of giving Iranian Government strength enough to act against
                                them.</p>
                            <p>It goes without saying that our influence should be exercised fully
                                and at all times against any dictatorship of the right in Iran,
                                whether by Shah, army, or anyone else. At same time I would
                                recommend some caution in following British suggestions too closely
                                in this particular case and would follow situation ourselves to
                                determine when and if our action is required.</p>

                            <p>94. Genera] Schwarzkopf informs me that new chief of gendarmerie,
                                General Kupal, under Shah’s direct orders, has assumed sole command
                                of gendarmerie, notwithstanding Article 20 of agreement between
                                American and Iranian Governments dated November 27, 1943 (Executive
                                Agreement Series 361) which provides that chief of mission shall be
                                appointed “head” of gendarmerie and have precedence over all
                                officers of gendarmerie. Kupal has assured Schwarzkopf of his desire
                                to cooperate with him closely and to continue use of US advisers but
                                says he must insist on his sole command authority.</p>
                            <p>Schwarzkopf is pleased with appointment of man of Kupal’s integrity
                                as senior Iranian officer in gendarmerie and is anxious to work with
                                him amicably but feels that usefulness of mission will be seriously
                                impaired unless we insist upon command authority as provided in
                                Article 20. Schwarzkopf suggests informally that situation might be
                                taken care of if Shah would designate himself and Kupal as joint <pb
                                    n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0112"/>commanders of gendarmerie,
                                with every important order being signed by both.</p>
                            <p>Incidental difficulties are caused by fact that Kupal is Major
                                General while Schwarzkopf is Brigadier General. During five years he
                                has been here, for example, Schwarzkopf has always been accorded
                                courtesy of drum salute on arrival at office, in capacity of
                                commander. Since Kupal took office, salute has been given to Kupal
                                and not Schwarzkopf. Latter feels matter of prestige is involved
                                which adversely affects respect for all American officers in
                                mission.</p>
                            <p>In discussing question with Schwarzkopf today I pointed out that
                                agreement of 1943 was drawn up during wartime, shortly after former
                                regime in Iran had collapsed and gendarmerie was in chaotic state.
                                Since our avowed purpose in all advisory activity is to assist local
                                peoples to manage their own affairs, question might arise whether it
                                was not time to renegotiate Article 20 or at least for us not to
                                insist on its implementation. Any controversy over this article
                                which got into press would furnish excellent propaganda material for
                                Soviets as proof that Americans have command of Iranian security
                                forces. Renegotiation last year of agreement for advisory mission to
                                Iranian Army even though that agreement had been much milder than
                                gendarmerie agreement, was decided upon in part to eliminate any
                                question of command authority.</p>
                            <p>Schwarzkopf points out, with justification, that if command authority
                                of his mission is eliminated, either through renegotiated contract
                                or failure to insist on enforcement of Article 20, he should be
                                replaced by new chief of mission who could begin on new basis of
                                strictly advisory functions.</p>
                            <p>I do not believe that renegotiation of agreement would be advisable
                                at this time due to misunderstandings and undesirable publicity
                                which would result. If we do not wish to insist upon command
                                authority, it would be preferable merely to allow Article 20 to
                                lapse and to accept advisory capacity of gendarmerie mission, with
                                same relationship to gendarmerie as Ridley<note n="1"

                                20 by heavy pressure and implications of serious displeasure, but I

                                <item>American officers in no way participate in equipping Iran Army
                                    and it is obvious Iran Army like other armies of world needs
                                    obtain modern arms for which purpose annual appropriation
                                    provided every year in budget War Ministry. Before recent war
                                    arms were purchased from various European countries. During war
                                    not only was work of equipping army halted but serious losses
                                    were suffered this respect by Iran Army and USSR Government
                                    better aware this fact than anyone else. Therefore, immediately
                                    upon termination hostilities Imperial Government Iran decided
                                    make up these losses. In pursuance this aim it approached those
                                    Governments which might be in position sell military equipment.
                                    Government USSR was one of those so approached. Unfortunately
                                    Government USSR quoted prices for arms inacceptable Iran
                                    Government. Only government whose offer was acceptable was USA.
                                    Iran Government has therefore in order safeguard interests of
                                    country, decided meet small fraction its army’s deficiencies by
                                    making purchases from USA.</item>

                                    time and which cannot be used for any military purpose. There is
                                    no other airfield in that area much less a vast airfield
                                    furnished with American equipment and exceeding limits Iran

                                    public knowledge and all these barracks are in hands of Iran
                                    Army. Except for a few who are employed by Iran Government there
                                    is not a single American soldier either in barracks or anywhere
                                    else in all Iran, and Imperial Government has not allowed and
                                    will not allow foreign soldiers of whatever government to enter
                                    Iranian territory. The phrase “military city” in your
                                    Excellency’s letter refers apparently to Amirabad which was used
                                    during war as American Army camp and which is now used by Tehran
                                    University and instead of being a military city constitutes the
                                    university quarter and residence of students. It is source of
                                    great astonishment that errors and reports of this sort which
                                    are devoid of truth should merit confidence and trust of Soviet

                                    reports unfortunately interpreted as facts in Your Excellency’s

                                    “facts” are as unfounded and devoid of truth as reports
                                    themselves. As Imperial Government does not in any way allow
                                    foreign nationals to travel in areas which are declared
                                    prohibited zones, Imperial Government will not grant such
                                    permission to its own employees who are not Iranian subjects.
                                    Moreover, no Iranian aircraft has flown or will fly over

                                    incontrovertible truths and invite attention USSR Government to
                                    them.</item>

                            <p>When Soviet Forces were in Azerbaijan in accordance Three Power Pact
                                of January 30, 1942, Soviet authorities did not abstain rendering
                                all material and moral assistance to group opportunists and
                                traitorous elements who under guidance Soviet officials rebelled
                                against Central Government. When Soviet authorities ceased
                                protecting them inside Iran and they were forced on December 11,
                                1946 to flee before the rage of inhabitants of Azerbaijan and fury
                                of Iranian public, Soviet Union opened its frontiers to these
                                elements and afforded them refuge on Soviet territory. According
                                reliable and incontrovertible information received by Iran
                                Government these elements are still being supported and strengthened
                                as is apparent from tone of Moscow and Baku radios as well as
                                clandestine radio which is undoubtedly somewhere in Caucasus and
                                broadcasts under name Democrat Party Azerbaijan. Moreover, incessant
                                movements of Soviet Troops frontier posts and maneuvers carried out
                                by Soviet Forces in border regions (against which Iran Government
                                has protested) completely confirms this policy of Soviet
                                authorities. Friendly relations existing between Iran and USSR
                                required that Soviet Government accede Iran Government’s request in

                                they did so confident of support Soviet Government. When they sought
                                refuge in Soviet territory after Iran Government had informed Soviet
                                authorities in advance and earnestly requested that these highwaymen
                                be denied refuge, Soviet Government unfortunately took no action
                                upon this legitimate request Iran Government. On June 13, 1947 at
                                Qaraqoyun the aforementioned highwaymen crossed Araxes River with
                                assistance Soviet frontier guards and are now being entertained and
                                supported on Soviet territory. You will agree Soviet conduct with
                                respect to fugitives of December 1946, namely, Pishevari and his
                                accomplices and also fugitives of June 1947, namely, Barzani

                                    Tehran advised, on February 6, that the forceful character of
                                    the Iranian reply was due to its having been drafted principally
                                    by Chief of Staff Ali Razmara. The Ambassador concluded that
                                    “Iran had nothing to lose by making forthright reply inasmuch
                                    meek acceptance of Soviet reproaches would not stave off any
                                    action Soviets had already decided to take.” The Ambassador also
                                    gave his view that the “Soviet note was deliberately timed to
                                    block Majlis ratification of arms credit” (telegram 145, 891.20

                                instance, US Govt wishes to be informed whether Iranian Govt desires

                                effected by exchange of notes; it is to be assumed that Iranian

                                made on merits question in Iran’s national interest and not in light

                                tentative thought here is that Mission Chief of Schwarzkopf’s

                                note at this time may include following: (1) to intensify propaganda
                                in opposition <gloss target="#t_ERP1">ERP</gloss> along lines recent
                                notes to US charging American imperialism; (2) to frighten Majlis
                                into defeating US arms purchase credit proposal; and (3) to reverse
                                present tendency of Iranian Govt to orient Iran toward western
                                democracies. There is further possibility Soviets may intend Jan 31
                                note to serve as “warning” within meaning of Article 6 of
                                Soviet-Iranian 1921 Treaty. If such is the case, Russians might be
                                planning to introduce troops into northern Iran and take the chance
                                that they could make plausible legal case if matter should be

                            <p>Iran Govt might wish to study question of whether 1921 Soviet-Iranian

                                preliminary study, we feel it is probable that Annex Two to 1921
                                Treaty makes inapplicable Article 6 of that Treaty in present
                                circumstances. Question of whether certain portions 1921 Treaty may

                                tone used in denying interference indicated to him existence new

                                felt this propitious moment to tell Majlis that American help for
                                these services should not be asked and that Iran Govt should press
                                for passage of bill without conditions. After Majlis approval, legal
                                agreement would exist between Govts and Iran Govt could then
                                consider whether it were necessary to ask for help in
                                implementation. Hedayat stated he would cable recommendation to
                                General Staff to press for action along above line.</p>
                            <p>Dept agreed unconditional passage most desirable and re-emphasized
                                that if Iran really wanted US material, it should make every effort
                                meet subsidiary expenses in face of approach expiration date. We
                                indicated we did not want to hold out false hope for future
                                assistance in meeting these costs. If help were promised and then
                                not given, charges were certain to be made in Majlis that bill had
                                been ramrodded under false pretenses. At best, any indication that
                                the US might possibly be able arrange such help might further delay
                                Majlis action beyond expiration date.</p>
                            <p>Hedayat is exploring possibility of using Brit ships in transporting
                                this equipment thereby cutting dollar outlay.</p>
                            <p>Suggest you tell appropriate Iran officials that passage of bill with
                                binding condition might completely destroy possibility of

                                thought Soviets would be seriously annoyed by such action. I said
                                they would undoubtedly be displeased but that any disadvantage on
                                this score would be more than offset by advantage of letting Soviets
                                and world know that Iran had confidence in UN and that Soviets could
                                not expect to write notes of this kind without having them brought
                                to attention of world organization. I said that for action to be

                                        especially Articles 5 and 6, with the Charter of the United
                                        Nations. Such a view is especially desirable because of our
                                        understanding that the Iranian Government may take the
                                        matter before the United Nations as a result of the Soviet
                                        note of January 31, 1948.”</p>
                                    <p>The question of the validity of the 1921 treaty had been
                                        raised in a memorandum of February 3 by Harry N. Howard,
                                        Adviser in the Division of Greek, Turkish, and Iranian
                                        Affairs, to Mr. Jernegan. Mr. Howard had concluded that “In
                                        the absence of a specific act of renunciation of the 1921
                                        treaty it must be assumed that it still continues in force.”

                                1921 took form from circumstances which no longer exist.</p>
                            <p>In 1921, Persia was still uncertain whether the United Kingdom’s
                                notice of May 13, 1918 that the Russo-British sphere of influence
                                convention of August 31, 1907 (100 British and Foreign State Papers,
                                555) was in suspense would be confirmed by action as thorough-going
                                as the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic was taking in the
                                treaty of February 26, 1921. Language concerning attempts of third
                                countries “by means of armed intervention to realize a rapacious
                                policy on the territory of Persia” evidently satisfied its sense of
                                independence at the time.</p>
                            <p>The Russian Bolsheviks, on the other hand, were fearful of
                                intervention across Persia or from Persian territory, and in the
                                previous May there had actually been an incident involving Denikin’s
                                forces at Enzeli. The Bolsheviki had not yet consolidated their
                                authority within Russia, where the application of the principle of
                                “self-determination” allowed them to disregard for the time outlying
                                potential dissident areas while they were reducing forces in
                                positive opposition <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0126"/>to
                                them. Externally, the Bolshevik regime was not recognized by other
                                governments, which were still suspected of seeking to intervene
                                against it; and several groups of emigres were active abroad in
                                seeking ways to bother or overthrow the Bolsheviki. Lenin’s
                                technique in treaties was to subscribe to generous propositions with
                                a view to acquiring support and to embarrassing the established

                            <p>A detailed examination of the literal terms of Articles V and VI of
                                the 1921 treaty, as reflected, repeated or modified by the treaty of
                                1927, indicates that a claim of conflict or inconsistency with the
                                Charter would be very difficult to substantiate on purely
                                hypothetical grounds. The language is loose, but on its face is not
                                repugnant to the purposes and principles of the Charter. It may be
                                doubted, if the question of mere interpretation of the articles were
                                made an issue, whether any organ of the United Nations would accept
                                jurisdiction of the matter.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Iran evidently feels that the Soviet Union is
                                likely to make extreme demands upon it on the basis of the two
                                articles in question and desires to avoid the constraint that would
                                occur in that event. Any attempt on the part of the Soviet Union to
                                frame a case based on the loose language of 1921 would undoubtedly
                                afford a basis for appealing a dispute or situation to the United
                                Nations. Any action taken under that language would afford even
                                better a basis for appeal. It may be assumed that Iran desires to
                                avoid a controversial case.</p>
                            <p>Iran seeks a method to render Articles V and VI of the treaty of 1921
                                inoperative. The direct approach to that objective would be to
                                propose negotiations with the Soviet Union to annul those articles.
                                A counterproposal would undoubtedly be made to reopen the
                                territorial <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0127"/>and
                                concessionary matters determined by other articles of the treaty.
                                The success of such a negotiation would be problematical.</p>
                            <p>If that approach is not adopted, a reexamination of the net mutual
                                obligations maintaining between Iran and the Soviet Union would
                                represent an orderly method of clarifying relations. The treaty of
                                February 26, 1921, the treaty of security and neutrality of October
                                1, 1927 and the convention defining aggression of July 3, 1933 cover
                                the same ground; and it would be a natural move to review them with
                                a view to consolidating their obligations. Such a negotiation would
                                necessarily be under the regime of the Charter and even its proposal
                                would be a deterrent to misuse of the loose terms of Articles V and
                                VI of the treaty of 1921.</p>

                                funds cover all costs to Khorramshahr.</p>
                            <p>Both Minister War and Chief Staff Razmara have taken position that
                                Iran Majlis, in passing arms credit law, has done all it is willing
                                to do in this matter and that it is now up to us to take next step.
                                They emphasize that government had considerable difficulty in
                                persuading Majlis to pass bill in first place and that there is
                                every reason to believe that any further request by Iran army for
                                funds to pack and ship arms would be met in Majlis by absolute
                                refusal. Note one of bill, as passed, was written in by Minister War
                                as concession to Majlis, most of whose members believe, apparently,
                                that this note settles question of packing and shipping inasmuch as
                                they are unable appreciate difficulties in way our advancing
                                necessary funds. Minister War and Razmara, although fully aware of
                                true situation, still hope that we will find some way to make funds
                                available and are attempting build up persuasive argument based on
                                theory that Iran, by passing credit law, irrevocably cast in its lot
                                with US against Soviets.</p>

                            <p>His Majesty began the conversation by saying that Iran had lost a
                                great deal of time in the past two years. He considered that Iran
                                could not continue in the present fashion, accomplishing nothing and
                                preparing itself for nothing. He felt that Iran with its poverty was
                                    <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0132"/>ripe for communist
                                penetration. Something had to be done and he, the Shah, could not do
                                it alone. Iran needed a strong government and it needed foreign
                                assistance. In reality Iran was in an even more serious danger than
                                some of the European countries which were occupying the attention of
                                the United States at the present time.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jernegan remarked that Iran at least had the advantage of having
                                no large and active communist party of the sort that was active in
                                Italy and France. His Majesty agreed that this was the case, but
                                pointed out that there was equally no strong anti-communist group in
                                Iran. He appeared to feel that the whole situation in the country
                                was so disorganized that a real communist drive would not be
                                adequately resisted.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty went onto speak of the great need for economic
                                development in Iran, as a preventive measure against popular
                                dissatisfaction and communist penetration. In this connection he
                                said there was great need for foreign financial aid. Mr. Jernegan
                                said that he saw no reason why the Iranian Government could not
                                obtain all the financial assistance it could utilize from the
                                International Bank. He did not expect that the Bank would approve in
                                one lump a sum of, say, $250 million, but he believed the Bank would
                                be quite ready to grant yearly amounts corresponding to the real
                                necessities of any realistic development plan. In other words, the
                                Bank would probably be willing to approve a small amount for the
                                first year or two, and then as the implementation of the plan
                                developed, would approve progressively larger loans, so that in the
                                end Iran would probably get the full amount required.</p>
                            <p>The Shah then went onto say that economic development was only one
                                part of the problem. The Iranian state must be fully prepared to
                                meet subversive activities on the part of the Soviet Union,
                                including the introduction of armed forces disguised as Kurds,
                                Azerbaijanis, etc. For this, the Iranian army must have adequate
                                arms and other equipment. His Majesty compared Iran to the last
                                third of the dam against Soviet aggression in this part of the
                                world. The United States, he said, had taken steps to support Greece
                                and Turkey, thus reinforcing two-thirds of the dam, and he could see
                                no reason why Iran should not equally be supported since the fall of
                                Iran would mean the fall of the Middle East and the destruction of
                                the barrier set up in Greece and Turkey.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Jernegan said that he was aware of the discussions on this
                                subject which had taken place between the Shah and Ambassador Allen.
                                He had further discussed the matter briefly with Mr. Allen and with
                                Ambassador Wiley<note n="2" xml:id="d76fn2">John C. Wiley, the
                                    Appointed Ambassador to Iran.</note> during his trip out to
                                Tehran. The first <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0133"/>element
                                to be considered was the fact that the Iranian Government as such
                                had never made a request to the United States for special military
                                assistance of the kind accorded Greece and Turkey. On the contrary,
                                it seemed that at least some Iranian political leaders would prefer
                                not to receive such special assistance. Mr. Jernegan had understood
                                from Ambassador Wiley that he would be prepared to discuss the
                                matter after his arrival in Tehran. In Mr. Jernegan’s opinion, it
                                was not out of the question that Iran might receive appropriate aid,
                                but it was a matter which would require careful consideration on the
                                part of both governments. The Shah said that a great deal obviously
                                depended on the analysis of the situation made by the United States
                                Government—that is, it would make a difference whether the American
                                Government considered that the Soviet Union would seize upon a
                                pretext to invade Iran or to bring about a war, or whether we
                                considered that the USSR would precipitate a war without any
                                pretext. Likewise, the decision would depend on whether the United
                                States itself was willing to go to war in case of necessity or
                                intended to confine itself exclusively to paper protests regardless
                                of what might transpire. If we were ready to fight to stop the
                                Soviet Union, we should make that known promptly. If we were not
                                ready, the Soviets would realize it very soon and would continue
                                their aggressive policy no matter what we might say.</p>
                            <p>Speaking personally, Mr. Jernegan expressed the opinion that the
                                Soviet Union did not wish to bring on a war and would refrain from
                                any overt act which might precipitate a conflict. Mr. Jernegan did
                                not think that the Red Army would cross the Iranian frontiers. He
                                felt that the real danger for Iran lay in underground Russian
                                penetration and possibly in the introduction of armed bands which
                                would masquerade as Iranian but would be supported by the Soviet
                                Union. The important thing for Iran, as well as for other countries
                                in similar circumstances, was to maintain internal stability and be
                                ready to nip in the bud any attempts at armed uprising instigated by
                                the Soviets.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty asked why Mr. Jernegan believed that the Soviets were not
                                prepared to bring on a war. In reply Mr. Jernegan advanced the view
                                that the Soviets had not yet consolidated their hold over their
                                satellites, the majority of whose people were still hostile to the
                                communist system, that their own people in Russia were disinclined
                                to embark on another war, that their economy had suffered very
                                severely in the war just past, and would require a great deal of
                                reconstruction still before they felt strong enough to wage war, and
                                that the general tactics of Soviet diplomacy in the past two years
                                was evidence that the USSR was still following a policy of seizing
                                such advantages as <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0134"/>it could
                                obtain without undue risk but of retreating wherever it met firm
                                opposition. In support of the latter point, Mr. Jernegan cited the
                                examples of Iran and Greece. In the Azerbaijan case, the Soviet
                                Union could have maintained its forces in Iran and maintained
                                control of Azerbaijan if it had wished to take the risk of a major
                                crisis, and similarly in Greece the Soviet Union, through its
                                satellites, could probably have seized a substantial part of Greece
                                if it had been merely a question of relative force. As had been the
                                case in Azerbaijan, the Soviets in Greece could have mobilized large
                                forces of pseudo Greeks under the banner of the so-called “Free
                                Democratic Government of Greece”, and could probably have overcome
                                the military resistance of the Greek army. In neither case had the
                                USSR been willing to force the issue, presumably because it knew
                                that such action would have clearly shown its aggressive intentions
                                and might have provoked a powerful reaction on the part of other
                                nations.</p>
                            <p>The Shah agreed that this might well be a true interpretation, but he
                                added that if the USSR found itself blocked in all directions by the
                                Western Powers, it might very well decide to precipitate a war now,
                                rather than wait until Europe should recover and the balance of
                                power turn definitively against the Soviets. He appeared to feel
                                that Russia might at any moment attack without warning. He went on
                                to say that dictatorial regimes, whether Nazi or Communist, had to
                                win victories in order to maintain the support of their own people
                                and continue in power. Mr. Jernegan observed that he thought there
                                was a difference in this respect between Nazi Germany and Fascist
                                Italy on the one hand, and Communist Russia on the other. It was
                                true that the two former had had to move forward always in order to
                                maintain their own prestige, but the communist regime in Russia was
                                of a somewhat different character. It had already survived one
                                period of retreat, or quiescence. Following the revolutionary
                                activity between 1917 and 1921, the USSR had found itself unable to
                                progress in its revolutionary policy outside of Russia and had then
                                turned its attention inward toward developing and building up its
                                own economy and consolidating its regime. The Russian people seemed
                                to be so firmly in the grasp of the communist government that the
                                latter was free to make strategic retreats without fear of internal
                                repercussions. It might be anticipated, therefore, that Moscow would
                                similarly “pull in its horns” if at the present time it were
                                confronted with superior strength and superior firmness on the part
                                of the western democracies.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty said that he hoped this theory was the correct one, but
                                indicated his belief that we should be prepared to meet any
                                contingency.</p>

                            <p>Referring to his desire to have a strong army, the Shah said that he
                                did not envisage a really large force. He would be quite content
                                with half the number of men which he understood Turkey planned to
                                keep under arms. Specifically, he did not advocate an Iranian army
                                of more than 150,000 men, whereas he believed the Turks had in mind
                                a standing force of about 300,000. He thought his plans in this
                                regard were very modest, in view of the fact, as he said, that Iran
                                was really a larger and wealthier country than Turkey. Mr. Jernegan
                                expressed his pleasure at the Shah’s realization of the desirability
                                of keeping Iran’s armed forces on a reasonable scale. He pointed out
                                that really large armed forces could be self-defeating, because it
                                could be such a drain on the national economy as to increase the
                                very poverty of the people, which His Majesty considered the
                                greatest asset of Communism. As an example Mr. Jernegan pointed out
                                that in Greece the country had reached a stage at which any increase
                                in the armed forces required not merely a grant of dollars from the
                                United States to finance the foreign exchange cost of the increase,
                                but also an additional grant of dollars for the importation of
                                consumer goods into Greece to be sold by the Greek Government to
                                produce revenues in Greek currency to cover the internal
                                expenditures involved in the increase in the armed forces.</p>
                            <p>Toward the close of the interview, His Majesty embarked on a general
                                discussion of constitutional systems and the desirability of having
                                a strong executive. While he did not say so specifically, it was
                                apparent that he had in mind the desirability of strengthening his
                                own power, in order to guard against and overcome the weakness and
                                irresponsibility of the Iranian Majlis. He emphasized his belief
                                that the Executive (by which he meant the Chief of State rather than
                                the Chief of Government) should have the power to dissolve the
                                legislature and call new elections whenever it appeared that the
                                legislature might be acting in a fashion contrary to the wishes of
                                the people. Mr. Somerville and Mr. Jernegan confined themselves to
                                general observations on this subject.</p>
                            <p>Just before terminating the interview, the Shah reverted to the
                                attitude of the Soviet Union and the objections which it raised to
                                any American assistance to Iran. He said he knew the USSR would
                                criticize any such assistance as being aggressive and imperialistic,
                                and he added, smiling, that he hoped the new American Ambassador,
                                Mr. Wiley, was a good imperialist. Mr. Jernegan remarked that
                                Ambassador Wiley was a good anti-communist, if that was what His
                                Majesty meant.</p>

                            <p>According to information which we have received, Professor Steinberg
                                in continuation of statements made on November 22 [<hi rend="italic"
                                    >28</hi>] of last year,<note n="2" xml:id="d77fn2">A summary of

                                    printed (861.9111/1–548). The lecture was entitled
                                    “Soviet-Iranian Relations and the Intrigues of British-American
                                    Reactionaries”.</note> has likewise given a lecture in Moscow on
                                the 18th of March of this year in which he made certain statements
                                regarding the policy of the Imperial Government, developments in
                                Iranian Azerbaijan, the influence of the Americans, etc. and without
                                any basis whatever attributed certain actions to Mr. Hakimi, Prime
                                Minister of Iran, identifying him as an old enemy of the Soviet
                                Government. He said notably that Mr. Hakimi is continuing his
                                previous unfriendly attitude toward the Soviet Government and that
                                the Americans are striving to gain control of the oil of Northern
                                Iran and to transform the territory of Iran into a second Greece.
                                The speaker added that Mr. Hakimi wishes to convert Iran into a
                                military base against the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>The professor in question concluded that in following this policy
                                Iran is playing with fire, that the Soviet Government cannot remain
                                indifferent and that it will not permit the existence on its
                                frontiers of a government serving as a military base for attack on
                                Soviet territory.</p>
                            <p>The fact is, unfortunately, that in spite of the statements made
                                repeatedly by the Imperial Iranian Government to the Embassy of the
                                Soviet Union relative to the independent and national policy of the
                                Iranian Government and the explanations given regarding the
                                employment of American advisors in the Iranian Government and the
                                policy of the Imperial Government regarding the oil of the North,
                                the previous unfriendly and unjustified attitude toward the policy
                                of the Imperial Iranian Government is still being followed.</p>
                            <p>It is likewise confirmed that certain known persons and circles
                                connected with the great and friendly government of the U.S.S.R.
                                have made statements without any foundation and contrary to
                                truth.</p>

                            <p>Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government
                                finds it necessary to bring to the attention of the leaders of the
                                Soviet Government the following points: <list>

                                        Iranian Prime Minister, is absolutely unfounded and untrue.
                                        In 1919 Mr. Hakimi was not a member of the cabinet of that
                                        time and made no personal statements regarding the Soviet

                                        integrity of the country. Moreover, Iran’s neighbor states
                                        have on several occasions officially and by treaty confirmed
                                        these facts.</item>

                            <p>The Soviet Government does not consider convincing the statements of
                                the Iranian Government regarding the American Military Advisers in
                                Iran, which allege that these advisers do not hold key posts, nor do
                                they have authority to direct affairs in the Iranian Ministry of War
                                or other military Departments. It is the Soviet view that these
                                statements are without foundation which is evident from the contents
                                of the Irano-American Agreement of October, 1947, which stipulates
                                “co-operation with the Iranian Ministry of War and men of the
                                Iranian Army for the purpose of increasing the fighting capacity of
                                the Iranian Army.” The facts mentioned in the Soviet note of January
                                31 show that the role of the American military advisors is one of
                                leadership in the Iranian Army.</p>
                            <p>In connection with the attempt of the Iranian Government to deny the
                                facts mentioned in the Soviet note of January 31 as stated in the
                                Iranian note,<note n="2" xml:id="d78fn2">Dated February 4, <ref
                                        target="#pg_101">p. 101</ref>.</note> the Soviet Government
                                must point out that in the year 1941 the Iranian Government also
                                tried to deny the existence of foreign agents in Iran whose
                                activities were directed against the Soviet Union, although these
                                activities were apparent to all.</p>
                            <p>The claim of the Iranian Government that “the Americans have not
                                monopolized the right to occupy key military posts in Iran” is also
                                contrary to fact. Furthermore this claim of the Iranian Government
                                is contrary to Article 24 of the American agreement which says
                                “during the time this agreement is in force or in case of its
                                renewal, the Iranian <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0140"
                                />Government will not allow the nationals of any other foreign

                                agreed to by the American and the Iranian Governments”.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Government considers as an injurious fairy tale and
                                rejects the statements of the Iranian Government which allege that
                                the Soviet authorities have had any part in the Azerbaijan affair,
                                the causes for which affair must be sought in the internal policy of
                                the Iranian Government. But regarding that part of the note,
                                according to which the Iranian Government says that the Soviet Union
                                has given refuge to Iranian subjects who because of their democratic
                                convictions and by reason of their defense of democracy and progress
                                were being persecuted by the Iranian Government, the Soviet
                                Government rejects these charges as being entirely without

                                Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>As regards the Iranian allegation that in the Soviet Union Iranian
                                political refugees have been granted permission to form military
                                units for the purpose of attacking Iran and also the allegation that
                                in Soviet territory Iranian political refugees operate a secret
                                radio station—these are provocative fabrications.</p>
                            <p>The statements regarding the movements of Soviet military units and
                                manoeuvers near the Iranian frontier are nonsense.</p>
                            <p>The efforts of the Iranian Government to make out that the Soviet
                                note of January 31 is an interference in the internal affairs of
                                Iran must be taken as an endeavor on the part of the Iranian
                                Government to evade political responsibility and this course which
                                is being pursued by the Iranian Government is contrary to
                                good-neighborly relations as provided in the Irano-Soviet treaty of
                                February 26, 1921.</p>

                                that you have talked with Mr. Allen, our former Ambassador to Iran,
                                concerning your letter to me of March 18th<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d79fn1">Not printed.</note> regarding the inclusion of

                            <p>The Iran Government has requested us to extend additional credit of
                                ten to fifteen million dollars for the repair and shipment of
                                surplus military supplies which Iran desires to purchase from us.
                                The Department has been energetic in seeking means through existing
                                facilities to provide this additional credit and it is hoped that
                                the means will be found through the War Assets Administration. Since
                                we were already working on the Iranian matter from this angle, it
                                was not considered necessary to include a reference to Iran in the
                                Greek-Turkish Bill.</p>
                            <p>The Department appreciates your interest in the Iranian situation and
                                fully shares your desire to support Iran. Mr. Allen will keep in
                                close touch with you regarding developments in this connection.</p>

                            <p>Your Excellency’s letter of 24th March, 1948 which was in reply to my
                                note of 4th February has been received. I regret that the leaders of
                                the Government of the U.S.S.R. paid no attention to the
                                considerations set forth in my last note.</p>
                            <p>As I have already pointed out in my previous note, all the statements
                                mentioned in your Embassy’s note of 31 January, 1948 concern
                                fundamentally and absolutely the internal affairs of Iran and the
                                government of His Imperial Majesty of Iran is perfectly free and
                                independent to adopt any decision for the improvement of conditions
                                in the country and the arrangement of the different institutions of
                                the Government.</p>
                            <p>You will agree that any expression manifested by any foreign
                                government concerning these affairs should be considered as an
                                interference in the internal affairs of this country of Iran.
                                Moreover, the Government of the U.S.S.R. has, in conformity with
                                article 5 of the treaty of friendship dated 26 February 1921 and the
                                pact of non-aggression and neutrality of 1st October, 1927,
                                explicitly undertaken to abstain from this kind of interference and
                                if I in reply to Your Excellency’s note, am giving some explanation
                                in this matter, it is only because of the friendship between the two
                                countries and merely in order to remove any misunderstanding on the
                                part of the leaders of the friendly and neighbor government.</p>
                            <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0142"/>
                            <p>Concerning the renewal of the contract of employment of a number of
                                Americans in the Iranian Army, I consider it unnecessary to make any
                                further explanation or to repeat what I have already said in my
                                previous note. But I am astonished that such a simple and clear
                                question should cause so much comment, even to the extent that the
                                esteemed leaders of the Soviet Government have found it necessary to
                                point to the events of 1941, and in particular to state that in that
                                year the government of Iran endeavored to deny that foreign agents
                                were active against the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>It is extremely regrettable that the Government of the U.S.S.R. pays
                                no attention to the obvious truth that apart from the fact that at
                                that time there were no armed forces of any foreign government in
                                Iran which had the intention of attacking the government of the
                                U.S.S.R., there was in any event, not the slightest ground for
                                resorting to the 1921 treaty. Until June, 1941 relations between
                                Germany and the Government of the U.S.S.R. were not such as to cause
                                the leaders of the Soviet Government to feel any anxiety with
                                respect to the German citizens in Iran, and from June 21 to August
                                25 of the same year, when foreign troops entered Iran, no change
                                occurred in the policy of Iranian neutrality. Consequently,
                                considering the text of the letter dated December 12, 1921 (No.
                                1600), of Mr. Rotstein,<note n="2" xml:id="d80fn2">League of Nations

                                resort to articled of the treaty of February 26, 1921, was nothing
                                but a pretext. Moreover, as it became clear to everyone, it was
                                intended only for the purpose of making use of Iranian means of
                                communication and expediting the allied aid to the U.S.S.R.</p>
                            <p>As to the refutation of my statements on the Azerbaijan incidents, I
                                am obliged—although I wished to avoid any mention of this subject—to
                                point to the failure of the Soviet Government to comply with the
                                tri-partite pact of January 29, 1942,<note n="3" xml:id="d80fn3">For

                                the internal affairs of the country and especially as regards
                                Azerbaijan. Such examples as the expulsion, exile and arrest of
                                Iranian Government officials and the pressure exercised by the
                                Soviet forces against the local garrison, and the prevention of
                                Iranian forces from entering Azerbaijan, and other matters not
                                mentioned here, are enough to confirm my statements.</p>

                            <p>On the subject of Iranian refugees in the territory of Your
                                Excellency’s Government about which it was alleged that they were
                                persecuted by the Imperial Government for holding democratic ideas,
                                it is deemed necessary to draw the attention of Your Excellency to
                                the fact that Iranian laws—like the laws of other countries—specify
                                that criminals, thieves and marauders be punished. Therefore, the
                                statements of Your Excellency to the effect that such persons hold
                                democratic ideas, and the attribution of the word “freedom-loving”
                                to such elements are extremely regrettable and are also contrary to
                                friendship and neighborliness. They are especially contrary to the
                                obligations of Your Excellency’s Government under the provisions of
                                the treaties of friendship of 1921 and 1927. For example, according
                                to section 1 of article 5 of the treaty of friendship, the Soviet
                                Government had undertaken to prevent the formation or residence in
                                its territory of organizations or groups, under whatever name, or of
                                individuals, with the purpose of fighting against Iran.</p>
                            <p>In view of the foregoing facts, you will agree that the statements of
                                Your Excellency about these persons, and the fact that they have

                                to continue a propaganda campaign directed against Iran, constitute
                                a definite and open breach of Soviet obligations.</p>
                            <p>The Imperial Iranian Government considers Your Excellency’s denial
                                that Iranian fugitives are being harbored for the purpose of future
                                attack against Iranian territory, and that Soviet forces are being
                                moved about or carrying out maneuvers in the region adjacent to the
                                border, as definite documentary assurances that in the future no
                                such incidents, the occurrence of which would constitute a breach of
                                this assurance, will take place.</p>
                            <p>As to the clandestine radio the existence of which in Soviet
                                territory was denied, the accurate information that the Imperial
                                Iranian Government possesses about this matter, which was brought to
                                the attention of the Soviet Embassy through notes Nos. 6352, 7353,
                                8464, of 1947–48 does not conform with this denial.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion it is pointed out that the Imperial Iranian
                                Government’s efforts to preserve friendship with the U.S.S.R. are
                                known to the entire world. Now, again I give my assurance that the
                                Iranian Government has no purpose other than strengthening justice
                                and good intentions in carrying out promises and compliance with
                                treaty obligations, and hopes that to see the same good-will in
                                respect to carrying out treaty obligations and the same efforts to
                                preserve friendship between the two countries on the part of the
                                Soviet Union.</p>

                                with sincerity his desire to improve social justice and standard of
                                living of masses in Iran. He showed great resentment over invocation
                                1921 treaty for military occupation Iran in 1941, claiming that
                                there were only half the number of Germans in Iran than in Turkey
                                and that no possible menace to USSR existed as foreseen in 1921
                                treaty.</p>
                            <p>He regards future with deep pessimism and evidently foresees Russian
                                invasion Iran at no very remote date. He did not believe Iranian
                                Government in exile, either in Washington or elsewhere, would serve
                                any useful purpose. He is determined to keep Iranian flag flying
                                somewhere in Iran. Under no circumstances can he foresee possibility

                                somewhere within country. He is impressed and encouraged by firmness
                                and clarity of American policy but very fearful that anything US may
                                do for Iran may be “too little and too late”. He said “if only we
                                could have half the tanks and munitions that US is sending to
                                Turkey”.</p>
                            <p>He talked at length about necessity of increasing agriculture and
                                mineral wealth of Iran.</p>
                            <p>I found Shah for his age (28) mature, well informed, and intelligent.
                                I got impression of a young man of good preparation, courage and
                                conviction.</p>

                            <p>The Embassy of the U.S.S.R. in Iran, in reply to your note of 22nd
                                March, has the honor to bring to the attention of the Iranian
                                Ministry of Foreign Affairs that, according to information received
                                by this Embassy, Professor Steinberg’s speech was mainly a
                                description of the policy carried out in Iran with regard to the
                                U.S.S.R. The violation of the Russo-Iranian oil agreement is a part
                                of that policy.</p>
                            <p>Professor Steinberg in his speech made reference to the
                                Irano-American agreement of October 6, 1947, and the activities of
                                the American military missions in Iran. In connection with these, he
                                made statements which are based on facts already mentioned in the
                                note of the Soviet Ambassador to the Iranian Prime Minister dated
                                31st January of the current year, which was also published in the
                                newspapers.</p>
                            <p>It is obvious that the statements made by a representative of public
                                opinion or representative of the Soviet press about the hostile
                                policy followed in Iran with regard to the U.S.S.R. cannot be a
                                subject for protest by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, the Soviet Embassy draws the attention of the Ministry
                                to the belligerently libelous propaganda launched by a great number
                                of Tehran newspapers against the U.S.S.R. For example, during the
                                period from January to March, the newspapers <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Tehrani</hi>
                                <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0148"/>
                                <hi rend="italic">Mossavar, Atesh, Arezoo, Saba, Sedaye-Vatan</hi>,
                                etc., have been constantly making libelous statements on the
                                internal and foreign policy of the U.S.S.R., and have alleged that
                                the U.S.S.R. had aggressive plans against Iran and other countries.
                                They have also published caricatures against the U.S.S.R. and its
                                authorities.</p>

                                to have agreement modified as soon as possible. He mentioned only

                            <p>FonMin said he could give most categoric assurances Iran Government
                                had no intention employing other military advisors but that
                                government regarded it as essential eliminate Article 24 in view
                                irresponsible criticism by certain members of Majlis. When I
                                mentioned that such a clause was included in agreements we have with
                                many other countries and considered indispensable from purely
                                practical consideration, he pointed out situation of Iran was not
                                comparable to countries in South America. I stressed our desire
                                assist Iran in manner most desired by Iran Government, and that
                                under no circumstances were we trying to impose anything.</p>
                            <p>After further discussion I agreed transmit to Department suggestion
                                that Article 24 be eliminated as requested by Iran Government and
                                replaced by an unpublicized exchange of letters in which FonMin
                                would give assurances. FonMin promised ascertain at once from
                                government whether this procedure would be acceptable. I, of course,
                                stressed I could not be sure Army and State Departments would agree
                                to this modification.</p>
                            <p>General Grow, whose information confirms desire of Iran Government to
                                modify existing contract, informs me he would prefer retention of
                                present arrangement but if this should not be feasible he believes
                                foregoing proposal would be acceptable. I should appreciate
                                Department’s urgent instructions since Iran Government obviously on

                            <p>(2) With specific ref Article 24, Iranians should be reminded that
                                this provision is included in all US military mission agreements and
                                covers practice followed, so far as we know, in similar agreements
                                other nations; that such practice is basic to US acceptance
                                responsibility render effective advisory assistance; that
                                substitution Iran-US understanding outside formal agreement would
                                probably violate spirit UN resolution implementing Article 102
                                Charter; that practical effect elimination article would be admit

                                refusal of which would leave Iran alone responsible in Soviet eyes

                                unfriendly, treatment northern neighbor; and that present wording

                                Article 24, you might suggest substitute wording along following

                            <p>377. Minister of Interior informed General Schwarzkopf 11th that
                                latter enjoyed full confidence of Iranian Government and that he,
                                Ahmedi, was in favor of retention of Schwarzkopf’s command authority
                                as provided in present agreement covering gendarmerie mission.
                                Minister continued, however, that Iran was in very difficult
                                position owing Soviet pressure and was anxious not to provoke USSR
                                at this time. Government had accordingly decided it would be best
                                for time being for head of gendarmerie mission not to have command
                                authority, and for mission to be advisory only. This, he said, would
                                be a purely temporary expedient and it would be intention of Iranian
                                    <pb n="138" xml:id="pg_138" facs="0152"/>Government to restore
                                Schwarzkopf’s full authority as soon as circumstances should
                                permit.</p>
                            <p>As General Schwarzkopf is reporting to Army Department, his reply was
                                that decision was entirely in hands of Iranian Government but that
                                he must point out he would probably be replaced if character of
                                mission were altered to make it purely advisory, even temporarily.
                                Ahmedi showed great concern over possibility of Schwarzkopf’s
                                departure and declared strong representations would be made through
                                Iranian Embassy in Washington to have him stay here during temporary
                                advisory phase of mission. Ahmedi gave assurances that during this
                                period Iranian commander would cooperate fully with Schwarzkopf. He
                                also said matter would be discussed with me by Foreign Minister and
                                himself, but Schwarzkopf is inclined to doubt now whether Iranian
                                Government will make a written reply to Ambassador Allen’s note of
                                February 7.<note n="1" xml:id="d90fn1">Not printed, but see first

                            </p>
                            <p>General Schwarzkopf is strongly of view that this move on part of
                                Iranian Government, constitutes appeasement of USSR taken in
                                conjunction with desire eliminate Article 24 of Grow Mission
                                contract. He feels presentation of matter as a purely temporary
                                expedient is a device to do away with command authority, which once
                                removed will never in his opinion be restored. He is skeptical of
                                assurances re full cooperation of Iranian commander once Article 20
                                is eliminated. Schwarzkopf also feels that it would be contrary to
                                the American interest for us to accede at this time to such a
                                proposal, especially in view of present prospects for our affording
                                concrete assistance to Iran in regard to supplying arms.</p>
                            <p>I should appreciate receiving urgently an indication of views of
                                State and Army Departments with regard to this latest
                                development.</p>
                            <p>I think present Iranian Government has become very decided on
                                reducing authority of Schwarzkopf mission. In view of present
                                political situation I am inclined believe this might be advisable.
                                The criterion of efficiency of the mission will depend on the extent
                                to which the gendarmerie would act on recommendations of an advisory
                                mission.</p>
                            <p>I suggest, however, no action be taken until Foreign Minister sends
                                for me to discuss matter.<note n="2" xml:id="d90fn2">Tehran, on
                                    April 15, reported information that the gendarmerie would be
                                    merged into the army, primarily for reasons of economy, and that
                                    the Shah had approved the merger (telegram 390, 891.20/4–1548).
                                    Then, on April 24, Ambassador Wiley advised that plans to merge
                                    the gendarmerie and army had been temporarily suspended because
                                    of the unfortunate publicity. He stated also that the “Foreign
                                    Minister did not deny to me [on the] 21st that government had
                                    decided merge army with gendarmerie and also eliminate
                                    Schwarzkopf’s command authority.” The Ambassador concluded that
                                    “we should insist on Iranian Government’s replying to Ambassador
                                    Allen’s note of February 7 before considering anything else.”

                            <p>386. Made my call at noon today on Soviet Ambassador Sadtchikov. I
                                was accompanied by First Secretary Wilson and Assistant Military
                                Attaché Gagarine, who has fluent knowledge Russian. Soviet
                                Ambassador had with him an interpreter, Oushomirsky, with fairly
                                good knowledge English.</p>
                            <p>Soviet Ambassador received me with courteous reticence. After
                                exchange of polite banalities, I told him I had read with much
                                interest his notes to the Iranian Government in which he alluded to
                                American activities in Iran, especially those of the military
                                mission. I said “Your notes are worthy of the highest tradition of
                                Russian romantic fiction.” The Soviet Ambassador was silent. I
                                continued that, however, I was sure his notes were based on
                                misinformation, not on malice.</p>
                            <p>The Soviet Ambassador then replied in a rather embarrassed manner
                                that his notes had been based on accurate information and that in
                                fact he had held back certain additional information. He added
                                perhaps we could discuss the matter further at some later date. I
                                went on, however, stating that American policy was dedicated to
                                peace and goodwill. The American advisers were here for the benefit,
                                not of the United States, but of Iran, which had asked for them. I
                                assured him I wanted to work with him in a cordial and friendly
                                manner. I repeated that his information had been erroneous, I said I
                                would gladly arrange for him and his collaborators to see every
                                aspect of American activities in Iran. For this he could prepare his
                                own program.</p>
                            <p>I quoted Pushkin “veracity can never be a restraint to genius” and
                                politely explained that I in no way desired to impede the genius of
                                His Excellency, but would be very happy for him to see everything
                                American in Iran with his own eyes. There was no response. I
                                repeated that I was very eager to collaborate with him fully. The
                                Soviet Ambassador, perhaps slightly perturbed, turned the
                                conversation to events in Colombia, and discussed at great length
                                conflicting press reports on Gaitan; whether Gaitan had been
                                assassinated or merely wounded. Refreshments were served copiously.
                                Then, in an atmosphere of considerably heightened cordiality, the
                                Ambassador took us for an extended tour of the magnificent Russian
                                compound. By comparison the American compound looks like an
                                abandoned gravel pit.</p>

                                    and African Affairs and former Ambassador to Iran.</note> the
                                Iranian Ambassador, Mr. Ala, spoke to me about the proposal that <pb
                                    n="143" xml:id="pg_143" facs="0157"/>the Iranian Government
                                should submit to the Security Council copies of the notes exchanged
                                between Iran and the Soviet Union during the past three months on
                                the subject of the activities of the American military missions in
                                Iran. The Ambassador said that Mr. Entezam, Iranian representative
                                at the UN, had just received instructions from his Government to
                                submit to the Security Council, for information but not for action,
                                the first three notes in this series. However, contrary to the
                                recommendation of Mr. Entezam and Mr. Ala, made to the Government in
                                Tehran, the instructions did not include authority to transmit the
                                notes under cover of a letter which would state the Iranian view
                                that Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty of 1921 was no longer
                                applicable. In fact, Mr. Entezam had been informed by the Foreign
                                Office that this matter had been considered by the Cabinet and that
                                it had been decided not to take such action. Both the Ambassador and
                                Mr. Entezam were very much disappointed at this, because they feared
                                that if Iran did not make its position clear at this time the Soviet
                                Union could take advantage of that fact later and assert that Iran
                                had implicitly recognized the validity of Article 6 and hence the
                                Soviet right to introduce troops into Iran if this appeared
                                necessary to protect the USSR against a threat to its security
                                arising out of foreign activities on Iranian territory. Accordingly,
                                they had again cabled Tehran stating their views and urging that if
                                the Government was unwilling to submit the recommended communication
                                to the Security Council, it should at least send a further note to
                                the Soviet Government stating the Iranian contention. This further
                                note could then be transmitted to the Security Council along with
                                the others.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the conversation the Ambassador asked whether the
                                attitude of the Department of State with respect to support for Iran
                                had changed in any way. I replied emphatically that it had not and
                                asked why he raised such a question. He said that recently Mr.
                                Entezam had discussed with the American representatives in New York
                                the proposed Iranian action in submitting the notes and covering
                                statement to the Security Council and had asked whether the United
                                States would be prepared to make some sort of declaration in support
                                of the Iranian position. He had been told that no such action was
                                contemplated at this time. The Ambassador felt that this was
                                inconsistent with the attitude adopted by the United States on
                                previous occasions when the Iranian case had been before the United
                                Nations. On such occasions we had always clearly indicated our
                                backing for Iran. The Ambassador considered that the present case
                                involved the interests of the United States just as much as the
                                previous instances, especially in view of the fact that our military
                                missions formed the subject matter of the Soviet-Iranian
                                correspondence.</p>
                            <p>I told the Ambassador that our interest in having the notes in
                                question submitted to the Security Council for its information had
                                been <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0158"/>made plain to
                                Ambassador Wiley, who had spoken about it on more than one occasion
                                to the appropriate officials in Tehran. (I did not directly reply to
                                his implied question regarding a possible American statement in this
                                connection.) Mr. Ala replied that he thought we should again
                                instruct the Ambassador to take the matter up and urge that the
                                Iranian Government take some positive action to make plain its
                                attitude toward the Treaty of 1921.</p>
                            <p>He then asked me if we had heard anything about the reported new
                                Soviet note which had so far not been published. I said that we had
                                only today received a telegram<note n="2" xml:id="d96fn2">No. 492.
                                    May 6, 6 p. m., from Tehran; it noted that the Iranian
                                    Government would not publicize this exchange of notes, inasmuch
                                    as the Soviet Union had not given them any publicity
                                    (761.91/5–648).</note> saying that the Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs had shown to Ambassador Wiley the text of the note and the
                                Iranian reply. The telegram had said that the Russian note was
                                substantially a repetition of the earlier notes and the Iranian
                                reply was likewise the same as those given to the earlier notes. Mr.
                                Ala said that he thought this made it all the more important for the
                                Iranian Government to take the action he had recommended and
                                therefore all the more important for our Government to urge such
                                action through the Ambassador in Tehran.</p>

                                and in view of necessity of US transferring Gen Schwarzkopf to other

                            <p>While we agree that qualified personnel of Gendarmerie Mission could
                                be used advantageously elsewhere and that we might consider

                                Mere presence of US Gendarmerie Mission, however ineffective, (1)
                                fulfills policy objective of preventing possibility of Iranians
                                employing Soviet advisers, and (2) tends to restrain Iranians from
                                consummating merger Army with Gendarmerie.</p>
                            <p>With regard to Grow Mission, would appreciate elaboration of reasons

                                    Ambassador Wiley said in part: “On subject of Article 24 of
                                    military mission contract I informed Foreign Minister that, if
                                    anything, I intended to strengthen it. Under no circumstances
                                    would I eliminate it. I went on to say that indeed in light of
                                    arms credit program I desired to review whole matter of future
                                    status of military mission.” (telegram 537, May 18, noon, from

                                should avoid specific inference that US implementation of arms
                                credit agreement is conditioned upon Iranian action relating to the
                                Grow Mission Agreement. What changes in Agreement would you consider

                                    should be no change in the present contract, especially in
                                    article 24 which provides the best and only safeguard to Iran.”

                                and disposal of surplus property abroad. The requested appropriation
                                was for $19,155,000, of which $15,675,000 is designed to cover the
                                cost of repairing, packaging, and shipping surplus military
                                equipment to be sold to Iran.</p>

                                Britain, and the Soviet Union declared their desire for the

                                    xml:id="d101fn1">Not printed.</note> Desire of Shah to visit US
                                in near future has been discussed in confidence with Amb Ala. He
                                feels strongly that time is not propitious for Shah to leave Iran
                                for following reasons: (1) Recent menacing Soviet notes, alleging
                                situation in Iran similar to 1941 when USSR occupied northern Iran
                                on asserted basis 1921 Treaty, portend intensification Soviet
                                subversive activities in Iran and possible introduction of Soviet
                                troops; (2) instability of present Govt and continuing doubts
                                concerning Qavam’s<note n="2" xml:id="d101fn2">Ahmad Qavam, former
                                    Iranian Prime Minister.</note> purposes require stabilizing
                                influence of Shah’s presence; (3) it is uncertain who would act as
                                regent in Shah’s absence, particularly since Shah <pb n="148"
                                    xml:id="pg_148" facs="0162"/>has not yet been crowned and,
                                therefore, successor has not been named; (4) in any event, visit of
                                Shah to US should be made an object in itself and not related to
                                such personal diversion as attending sporting event in London.</p>
                            <p>While recognizing general desirability of Shah visiting US and
                                realizing that Iranian situation will probably never be completely
                                stabilized, Dept tends to agree with Ala in present
                                circumstances.</p>
                            <p>If you concur in this estimate, we suggest that you attempt to
                                discourage Shah from persisting in his desire to visit US in near
                                future. As reasons for such suggestion to Shah, you might wish to
                                point out (1) that exigencies of political campaign during election
                                year might make it difficult for President and other high officials
                                to devote as much time as they would like to Shah, (2) other Chiefs
                                of State have already been invited to visit US this summer and their
                                presence would also detract from time which President could devote
                                to Shah, and (3) unpleasantness of Washington summer weather.</p>
                            <p>You should of course reiterate that we are most anxious to have His
                                Majesty visit US whenever time is propitious.</p>

                                        action in Nakhichevan-Maghrin on the Iranian frontier.
                                        During the course of the shooting, some bullets fell on
                                        Soviet territory. The shooting ended at 2:15 a. m. after a
                                        red projectile was seen over Iranian territory. The chief

                                    from the Iranian Foreign Office which replied to the American

                                    concurrence of the Iranian Government with the note of June 9.
                                    The Ambassador and Colonel Pierce found the Iranian note
                                    “entirely acceptable”. Tehran transmitted these views and the

                                residence yesterday morning. He remained one hour and half. (I am

                            <p>Hajir started off on urgent necessity for raising standard of living
                                of masses, reducing cost of living, and expressed deepest interest
                                in pursuing seven year plan most vigorously. He wishes, however, to
                                explore possibility of obtaining credits abroad (meaning US) for
                                immediate importation of urgently needed foodstuffs, chiefly rice
                                and sugar, cheap textiles and other consumer goods. He spoke in
                                terms of some 40 million dollars. He discussed economic matters at
                                considerable length and seemed to be somewhat hurt that
                                International Bank is inclined to dole out any loan only when bank
                                is convinced that funds are being well and wisely expended.<note

                            <p>He then rather anxiously raised question of Bahrein. He told me of
                                very deep interest felt in Iran over the question. He said naturally
                                it was question that involved both Great Britain, which had its
                                treaty with the Sheik and the US which had the petroleum
                                concessions. I added perhaps also Portugal which also had claims. He
                                said “Yes, yes, they were there too.” What he specifically wanted to
                                know from me was whether there was a favorable opportunity now

                                would have to work this question out with British. I personally did
                                not think that outlook was very bright.</p>
                            <p>Then he said, “Indeed we have two international problems; the second

                                commercial exchanges I could see no objection; indeed, it would seem
                                to me advisable that Iranian Government should leave nothing undone
                                in view of tenseness of relations with Soviet Union to normalize if

                            <p>770. Saw Prime Minister for nearly hour last evening. Most important
                                topic discussed was his interview with Sadtchikov, Soviet
                                Ambassador, which interview took place Friday and lasted two hours.
                                Prime Minister stated that it was clear Sadtchikov talked only on
                                basis of specific instructions from Moscow.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister, who, I understand, speaks excellent Russian, told
                                Sadtchikov of his earnest desire to improve relations with Soviet
                                    <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0167"/>Union. Then Prime
                                Minister referred to Iranian Gold held by Russia, to Iranian customs
                                claims against USSR, and other economic matters at issue. Sadtchikov
                                complained over “contingents” of Russian imports into Iran held by
                                Iranian customs. Prime Minister replied that it would be easy to
                                find prompt formula for release of their “contingents” provided that
                                Soviet Union would not insist on selling to Iran at ten times
                                pre-war price level while at same time refusing to pay more than
                                twice pre-war price level for Iranian exports to USSR. All USSR had
                                to do was to be reasonable.</p>
                            <p>Sadtchikov answered that all this was irrelevant. There was not one
                                question, including that of the gold, between Iran and Soviet Union
                                which could not be immediately and satisfactorily settled provided
                                that Iran changed its “inadmissable” policy of political and
                                military “unity” with US. Sadtchikov then sounded off with old theme
                                song, namely, that US, with Iranian complicity, was constructing
                                subterranean deposits of aviation fuel and building secret
                                airfields.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister replied that this was untrue. Where, he answered, were
                                the secret airfields? There was, he insisted, no subterranean fuel
                                storage. Prime Minister asked why should Iran or anyone else be
                                interested in such activities. Iran Government would under no
                                conceivable circumstances ever dedicate itself to Communist
                                revolution. Therefore should war break out, Iran would be on side of
                                allies (meaning of course, US and UK). Abadan, Prime Minister added,
                                was in British hands. Who needed, therefore, secret subterranean
                                fuel deposits?</p>
                            <p>Sadtchikov continued his charges against US activities in Iran,
                                reminding Prime Minister of Soviet offer to furnish, without charge,
                                planes, arms, munitions, et cetera, as well as number of Soviet
                                military instructors, likewise on gratis basis. Sadtchikov expressed
                                resentment that instead of accepting Soviet generosity, Iran should
                                have turned to US. Prime Minister replied that after all Iran was an
                                independent and sovereign nation, and felt itself free to turn
                                wherever it wished.</p>
                            <p>Sadtchikov then complained against publicity which had been given to
                                frontier incidents. Stories about frontier incidents, Sadtchikov
                                declared, were largely invented, publicity given to subject had been
                                unnecessary and hostile to USSR. Prime Minister replied by asking
                                whether Soviet incursions and frontier incidents should be
                                considered a normal and continuing state of affairs between two
                                countries with a common frontier. Sadtchikov, whose instructions
                                perhaps did not cover this query, sidestepped, replying that any
                                publicity which agitated Majlis and aroused public opinion should be
                                avoided. He was apparently very firm on this point.</p>
                            <p>Soviet Ambassador—I think this is rather significant—raised question
                                of Soviet oil concession in north, which was defeated in Majlis. <pb
                                    n="154" xml:id="pg_154" facs="0168"/>He gave Prime Minister to
                                understand that rejection of concession by Iran was something that
                                USSR could not stomach. He was not speaking, Sadtchikov said,
                                because of material considerations involved. It was more serious
                                than that. Soviet prestige throughout entire world had been
                                seriously damaged by Iran Government—the situation had to be
                                remedied.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister concluded our conversation by asking my advice. He had
                                obviously taken conversation with Sadtchikov very serious[ly]
                                indeed. He said that his Government had to choose between two
                                courses of action: (1) That Iranian policy was fixed, clear and
                                definite and would be followed. Soviet Union could, for its part,
                                adopt whatever policy it desired, or (2) Iran Government could leave
                                door half open—I interrupted him to ask “To permit the Russian foot
                                to be interjected?” Prime Minister replied “No”. He said that what
                                he meant by leaving door half open was merely to talk in order to
                                stall for time. I told him that I would like to think it over.</p>
                            <p>My feeling is that I should tell Prime Minister that conversations
                                just to gain time would not deceive Russians for a moment. They
                                could produce misunderstanding, even confusion. This might
                                facilitate Russian designs. Iranians should not pursue such a policy
                                but ought to protest again against the notes which Soviet Union has
                                addressed to Iran Government; utterly false Soviet charges should be
                                withdrawn; incursions into Iran should be stopped at once, and
                                “clandestine” radio activities likewise should be discontinued.</p>
                            <p>I would therefore, greatly appreciate Department’s guidance before
                                Tuesday, when I shall have my next interview with Prime Minister, I
                                shall also see Shah on Tuesday.</p>
                            <p>British Chargé called upon me last evening. Following my interview
                                with Prime Minister, Creswell was received by Hajir for half hour’s
                                talk. Prime Minister went over pretty much same ground with Creswell
                                as he did with me. Creswell, I believe, is sending only a brief
                                telegram to Foreign Office and regards Sadtchikov’s representations
                                with serene composure.</p>

                                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Iran should respond to Sadchikov’s

                                stalling and playing for time.</p>
                            <p>My feeling is that I ought to inject as much spirit of polite
                                resistance as possible into present Iranian attitude towards
                                USSR.</p>
                            <p>Perhaps Iranian firmness might help; certainly Iranian weakness could
                                only hinder. To be specific, I would like to let Shah know, of
                                course, quite discreetly, that Sadchikov’s representations furnish
                                not merely pretext but urgent motive for denouncing Articles V and
                                VI of Treaty of 1921, and to lead Prime Minister to think that his
                                thought of “keeping door half open” with Russians is dangerous in
                                that his alternative idea of complete but reasonable firmness is
                                what situation requires.</p>

                                Shah, Prime Minister and Razmara July 6:</p>
                            <p>1. We do not agree with Shah’s suggestion that Iran should denounce
                                1921 treaty, for following reasons: <list>

                                    <item>Public airing Iran-Soviet differences at this time might,
                                        in light overall Soviet position, provoke rather than deter
                                        further Soviet interference in Iran.</item>
                                </list>
                            </p>
                            <p>For your info only, Ala and Entezam are understood to have revived
                                their proposal of mid-April that Iran communicate to UN, for info
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, recent developments bearing
                                upon Iranian case still on <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> agenda.
                                In proposed communication, Iran would state that, in light of UN
                                charter, any state (USSR) which considers its security endangered by
                                activities of another state (Iran) is obligated to appeal to UN for
                                    <pb n="156" xml:id="pg_156" facs="0170"/>resolution of
                                difficulty and refrain from unilateral action which might endanger
                                peace. Ala does not recommend denouncing 1921, treaty. While we
                                agree that above position is in general correct, any situation
                                involving USSR prestige should preferably not be given publicity in
                                immediate future because Berlin crisis in East-West relations is
                                expected to reach climax in few days.</p>
                            <p>2. We agree with your feeling that keeping door half open, with
                                Russians is dangerous policy for Iran to follow and that Iran would
                                be well-advised to pursue “fixed, clear and definite” policy of
                                standing up for its independence and of carrying on its foreign
                                relations on basis of sovereign equality with other states, free
                                from coercion. Only by pursuing such course can Iran expect
                                effective support of peace-loving members of UN and sympathy of
                                world opinion. That course should be taken with firmness and no
                                retreat, but quietly for the time being.</p>
                            <p>We, of course, share your concern over recent developments in
                                Iran-Soviet relations, particularly Soviet notes, border incursions,

                                Iran and Soviet Union, including UN charter, and will transmit
                                document soonest. Iranian situation is under constant scrutiny here
                                and further guidance will be accorded in light your

                            <p>777. Saw Prime Minister for nearly an hour and Shah for nearly two
                                hours yesterday afternoon. Thoroughly covered ground as outlined in

                                Minister, I think is in complete agreement.</p>
                            <p>Shah insisted Ala has repeatedly urged denunciation Article Six
                                Treaty 1921. Ala had informed him that Department has frequently
                                complained to him of lack of clarity, vacillation and indecision of
                                Iranian foreign policy. Shah could not understand this since he
                                considers Iranian policy has been forthright and courageous. He
                                claimed that none of smaller countries of world has stood up more
                                resolutely to USSR than Iran. However, I am sure Shah will stay on
                                beam as indicated by Department. If, however, there are more Soviet
                                incursions Shah wants to give publicity in purely factual manner
                                without anything sensational and no propaganda. Publicity already
                                given to previous incidents has, in opinion both of Shah and Prime
                                Minister, had wholesome effect on Russians.</p>

                            <p>Both Shah and Prime Minister are most eager to accomplish something

                                clearly political. Shah believes that some money will be forthcoming
                                from <gloss target="#t_AIOC1">AIOC</gloss> but both he and Prime
                                Minister are very eager to get some credits from US for immediate
                                shipment cotton textiles and sugar. Shah claims prompt importation
                                foregoing commodities would have “tremendous effect” on Iran. Shah
                                is also very interested in importing American agricultural
                                machinery. Both Prime Minister and Shah seem very pessimistic about
                                feasibility of using Iranian financial resources in spite of what
                                appears to be more than flourishing condition of Bank Melli and good
                                condition governmental finances. Shah is very anxious to have arms

                                urgent. He states that with present supplies Iran Army should fight

                                remedy for alleged Iranian damage to Soviet prestige; and (2)
                                Iranian Govt might properly continue trade discussions with Soviet
                                Amb, insisting of course upon Soviet Govt meeting its outstanding

                                    >Deptel</gloss> 628, July 5, explaining that prior discussion

                                Tehran guidance before interviews scheduled July 6. Observing upon
                                Bevin’s draft instructions, Dept commented that while there was
                                apparent agreement between Brit and US concerning propriety
                                continuing Soviet-Iranian trade talks in Tehran, there would appear
                                to be difference of opinion concerning choice of alternative courses
                                of Iranian action posed by Hajir. Dept expressed its understanding
                                Iranian oil policy had been made clear in Majlis Law of Oct. 1947
                                and its belief that no useful purpose would be served by Iranians
                                pursuing that subject in further conversations with Soviet Amb. In
                                view of recent disturbing developments in Iran-Soviet relations,
                                Dept believed it highly important Iranian Govt continue maintain
                                “fixed, <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0174"/>clear, and
                                definite” policy of standing up for its independence by resisting
                                Soviet pressure.</p>
                            <p>In this connection, Dept expressed informally its concern over
                                reported Brit <gloss target="#t_FonOff1">FonOff</gloss> belief that
                                Soviet Govt did not appear to be very interested in Iran at present
                                moment. Dept believed, on contrary, that situation deserved constant
                                scrutiny of western powers interested in security of Iran. In
                                premises, therefore, Iran would be ill-advised to permit even
                                appearance of willingness to compromise its independence by
                                discussing with Soviet Amb at this time USSR desire for oil
                                concession in Iran.</p>
                            <p>In course of above conversation, Dept referred to Shah’s suggestion
                                that Iran denounce 1921 Treaty and cited reasons listed in <gloss

                            <p>206. For Loy Henderson from Wiley.<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1"
                                    >Ambassador Wiley left Tehran on July 7 for convalescence on a
                                    Turkish island in the Sea of Marmora (telegram 781, July 7, 10
                                    a. m., from Tehran, 123 Wiley, John C). He resumed charge of the
                                    Embassy on July 20.</note> For years in a loyal but fruitless
                                endeavor American efforts were devoted to gaining the confidence of
                                the Soviet Union. Certainly we are now at long last relieved from
                                the necessity of making any sacrifice or effort in order to preserve
                                a confidence that was never forthcoming.</p>
                            <p>I refer now to the official charges brought by the Soviet Government
                                against the activities of our military missions in Iran and to
                                Soviet references to Soviet Iranian treaty of 1921. These charges
                                are false, malicious and dangerous. They have been given widest
                                publicity and contribute to uncertainty of world opinion. To bring
                                up in connection with American activities in Iran the possibility of
                                the Soviet Union’s invoking treaty of 1921 is ominous blackmail.</p>
                            <p>[It is] True [that] Soviet charges have been denied categorically by
                                Iranian Government but all recall the Soviet allegations and none
                                remember the Iranian refutations. Why? Because we have remained
                                silent. Yet we are party of first part in all of this. Iran is
                                merely the locality, according to Soviet complaints, which we are
                                converting into a <hi rend="italic">place d’armes</hi> for
                                aggressive attack against USSR. Therefore, I feel that for us to
                                continue to maintain silence is innocently to collaborate <pb
                                    n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0175"/>with Soviet propaganda and
                                imprudently to further Soviet designs.</p>
                            <p>My instructions from Department then boiled down have been in
                                substance that Iran Government, should maintain a firm attitude
                                towards Soviet Union, should do nothing to wound Soviet
                                susceptibilities, should refrain from raising question of 1921
                                treaty. In my approaches to Ionian Government I have followed
                                Department’s instructions to the letter.</p>
                            <p>But why must we remain silent when false witness is borne against us?
                                Soviet intentions are clearly only to build up a fictitious
                                juridical case for marching into Iran if and when circumstances
                                permit. The USSR I fear is not thinking in terms of Azerbaijan
                                alone. Soviet sights are raised to Abadan<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d113fn2">Site of the refinery of the Anglo-Iranian Oil
                                    Company.</note> and Persian Gulf. Are we not running a grave
                                risk that our silence may be dangerously misinterpreted? May we not
                                be encouraging the prevalent legend that Iran lies within [<hi
                                    rend="italic">without?</hi>] area of our strategic concern?</p>
                            <p>I venture to suggest that for our policy to be truly prudent it
                                should not he timid. Crisis in Berlin, turmoil in Palestine and
                                confusion in Italy merely add to need of vigilance and a positive
                                policy everywhere, Iran included. We should avoid the vulnerability
                                of cautious indecision.</p>
                            <p>I am not pleading for provocative action nor for wounding Soviet
                                prestige in order to gain an imaginary point in some senseless game,
                                but we can not afford to permit grave and baseless charges against
                                us to pass unchallenged. And why should we? Further we should not
                                discourage the Iranian Government from seeking in a dignified manner
                                a juridical interpretation of the 1921 treaty which the Soviet Union
                                is now hanging over the Iranian head like the sword of Damocles.</p>

                            <p>678. As indicated in <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 628
                                July 5, we are in general agreement with Ala–Entezam proposal that
                                recent developments bearing upon Iranian case should be communicated
                                to UN for info <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, though not at
                                present moment. Keeping <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> abreast of
                                pertinent developments <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0176"
                                />conforms with Iran’s obligations as party to case on <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> agenda and failure to do so might be
                                prejudicial to subsequent consideration of Iranian case. Info which
                                Iran might transmit would, in our view, confirm correctness of US
                                position in having supported retention of Iranian case on <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> agenda.</p>
                            <p>While Ala and Iran Emb attorney agree with Dept that time is not now
                                propitious to communicate with <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>,
                                Ala is recommending to Shah that decision be taken and preparations
                                made which would permit immediate despatch of Iranian communication
                                to UN at first opportune moment. He feels that such communication
                                should refer to recent representations of Soviet Amb and increasing
                                incursions of Soviet armed bands, and would transmit translations of
                                notes recently exchanged between Iran and Soviet Union. He proposes,
                                further, that Iran Govt should take such occasion to refute by
                                implication Soviet Govt’s alleged right, so far not clearly refuted,
                                unilaterally to introduce troops into Iran under 1921 Treaty (<gloss
                                    target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 637, July 8).</p>
                            <p>As means to above end, Ala is recommending to Shah that he and
                                Entezam be furnished with data on recent Soviet representations and
                                border violations, together with texts of all pertinent notes
                                exchanged between Iran and Soviet Union. He is proposing, further,
                                that he and Entezam be instructed by Iran Govt very confidentially
                                to prepare exact wording of appropriate communication for info
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and to consult with Dept as to
                                most propitious moment for despatching it to UN.</p>
                            <p>Dept concurs with above proposals. In conversations with Shah and
                                    <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, Emb might take
                                occasion to indicate its approval.</p>

                                principal internal Iranian objective at this time appears to be
                                economic and social improvement and that other schemes should be
                                evaluated in terms of their contribution to that objective. Proposal
                                of constitutional change continues to appear unnecessary to

                                probably accentuate internal discord. Dept Rep added that persistent
                                Soviet threat was principal external Iranian problem at present
                                time, particularly in view world situation and sequence of recent
                                developments in Soviet-Iranian relations. In premises, Dept Rep
                                suggested Shah would be well-advised to proceed slowly, if at all,
                                in his desire for constitutional reform.</p>
                            <p>It was suggested to Brit Emb Rep that Shah’s conversations in London
                                might provide exceptional opportunity for UK officials to explain
                                successful though restrained role of monarch in Brit constitutional
                                system. In order that Shah might not feel rebuffed, Brit might wish
                                to make certain substitute suggestions of positive action which
                                would give vent to Shah’s energetic desire for national advancement
                                and, at same time, tend to unite divers elements Iranian population,
                                focus their attention upon most important issues, and increase
                                popular affection for King.</p>

                            <p>1366. I have just read Wiley’s telegram to Loy Henderson (Istanbul’s
                                206, July 16 [<hi rend="italic">15</hi>]) and cannot refrain from
                                saying a word in support, of points Wiley makes. Realize we are
                                likely to be criticized by certain sections of American press if we
                                indulge in content of polemics with Soviet Union but feel we tend
                                too much toward attitude of dignified reticence and letting facts
                                speak for themselves in face of completely false and malicious
                                charges which are so frequently typical of Soviet tactics. While in
                                most cases our comparative reticence gets support at home it is not
                                understood in large sections of Europe where the charges are heard
                                but the facts are unknown and even at home press which applauds our
                                dignified position one day is first to lacerate us for failing to
                                defend ourselves if reports from Europe make it appear Soviets
                                scored a point in cold war. The example Tehran brings tip is
                                particularly flagrant because we are officially coupled with the
                                Iranian Government in a Soviet allegation which is completely false.
                                My own feeling is that we should go a good deal further than we have
                                in past in rebutting constantly and vigorously false and
                                vituperative allegations by the Soviet Union and that we should
                                never under any circumstances refrain from immediate official
                                rebuttal when as in the present case the allegation is made
                                officially. Many times in conversation with Vyshinski and others, I
                                have had the comment made to me, “You did not deny our statement so
                                obviously it must be correct.”</p>

                                    then against Mediterranean and that any delay forced by Iran

                                    Shah suggested British reconnaissance party should be sent

                                <p>5. In light foregoing Shah will be told informally this week an
                                    amalgam of US and UK views as expressed above. It will be
                                    pointed out to him that neither US nor UK know how their future
                                    jet fighter production programs will develop and that source of
                                    aircraft should in any case be source of training, British will
                                    suggest that Iran had better plan for present to make out with
                                    US aircraft (Paragraph 4(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) above) for
                                    which US may be able to train. British will probably undertake
                                    to look into the possibility of the eventual supply British jet
                                    aircraft (see Paragraph 4(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) above).</p>

                                    attitude, asked Pyman whether His Majesty’s Government
                                    entertains idea of establishing British air mission Iran, Pyman
                                    replied that British Government has no idea of establishing
                                    either an air or other military mission in Iran. He said that
                                    even if this idea were contemplated, the difficulties <pb

                                    encountered would be a deterrent. Pyman said that UK wished for
                                    fullest cooperation with US on all military matters (including
                                    air) in Iran. When rivalry within Iranian air force between
                                    pro-American and pro-British factions was mentioned, Pyman
                                    deplored this possibility and hoped that Shah would return from
                                    London with sounder ideas (Paragraph 5 above) which might help
                                    reduce such feelings.</p>
                                <p>7. Pyman asked foregoing should be treated Top Secret because
                                    there has not been an opportunity to brief Creswell as above.
                                    This will be done but he would prefer American Embassy Tehran
                                    not to mention question to Creswell until latter has more

                            <p>899. Minister Agriculture Busheri has approached Embassy informally
                                requesting that we seek Department and Export-Import <pb n="167"
                                    xml:id="pg_167" facs="0181"/>Bank preliminary, views re
                                possibility Iran Government borrowing $10,000,000 for purchase
                                agricultural implements and plants to manufacture synthetic ammonia
                                and insecticides. If reaction favorable Minister contemplates
                                negotiation with two or three agricultural implement manufacturers
                                for up to 1,000 tractors for 1948 and undetermined amounts of other
                                implements which would be purchased and distributed by government.
                                Agreement would be made with manufacturers for establishing
                                servicing centers. Plans for synthetic ammonia and insecticide
                                plants are rather vague and in discussing plans Minister had to send
                                out for an assistant to recall name “synthetic ammonia” although he
                                did observe that such plants are the “very latest thing.”</p>
                            <p>Questioned as to where this program fitted in with seven-year plan
                                which Embassy understood was to be self-financed at least first
                                year, Minister observed this program was for immediate action and
                                anyway he did not see how seven-year plan could be started without
                                foreign borrowing.</p>
                            <p>In later discussion of foregoing with Ebtehaj Governor Bank Melli he
                                complained that he could not understand confused policy of present
                                government regarding foreign borrowing. He continues to oppose
                                piecemeal approach to development program and commented that if
                                Minister Agriculture obtained this loan every other Ministry would
                                have an “urgent” program. He questions intrinsic desirability of
                                program and feels it should be passed on by board of competent
                                experts.</p>
                            <p>As noted in joint American and British Embassy report (Embassy
                                dispatch 159, June 23<note n="1" xml:id="d119fn1">Not
                                    printed.</note>) Embassy does not consider that large-scale
                                importation of agricultural machinery would be desirable. In 1948
                                dealers are expecting to bring in up to 600 tractors which should be
                                enough considering there are probably not more than 200 in country
                                now. Ministers plan to concentrate on limited number makes and types
                                has merit from servicing standpoint but this could perhaps be
                                achieved without governmental entry into field on large scale. With
                                respect to proposed factories, Ministry’s nebulous plans should
                                receive study competent experts. Although they might be desirable
                                they could hardly be classed as high priority projects.</p>
                            <p>Embassy suggests reply along following lines: We are reluctant to
                                give serious consideration to present inquiry since we understand
                                legislation will soon be passed setting up planning board and
                                authorizing broad economic development program. Applications for
                                credit under this plan should more properly be directed to
                                International Bank. However, if Iran Government prefers to separate
                                present program from general program and submit to Export Import
                                Bank detailed <pb n="168" xml:id="pg_168" facs="0182"/>plans worked
                                out with American suppliers, Iran Government is assured that credit
                                request based on sound plan would receive careful consideration of
                                bank.</p>

                            <p>924. Had long interview with Prime Minister. He told me that day
                                before yesterday Sadchikov, the Soviet Ambassador, saw him for three
                                hours and half.</p>

                            <p>Sadchikov reviewed Soviet Persian relations since 1921, emphasized
                                extreme generosity of Soviet policy toward Iran, enumerated
                                concessions which Soviet Union had made, declared that Soviet Union
                                had made Iran the master of its own house. Sadchikov deplored the
                                present hostility of Iran towards the Soviet Union. Hostile
                                installations were being prepared along the frontier, and Iran had
                                fallen into the camp of the enemies of the Soviet Union. He spoke
                                specifically of the US. Between the Soviet Union and the US
                                relations were bad. There was possibility of war. Yet Iran, the
                                neighbor of the Soviet Union, was permitting the army and
                                gendarmerie to be taken over by the American Army. And through
                                credits and otherwise Iran had fallen under the economic sway of the

                                apparently made calm but vigorous denial of all of Sadchikov’s
                                charges, at the same time reviewing long list of Iranian complaints
                                against Soviet Union, particularly those having to do with
                                Azerbaijan, Pishevari, etc. Sadchikov continued that “insult” of the
                                question of oil in the north had to be “effaced.” He went on to say
                                that for Iran to be independent and master of its own house, Iran
                                must get rid of hostile foreign influences. He referred again to the
                                American military missions and the arms credit program. Then
                                Sadchikov produced glittering gem: not merely was the position of
                                the, Soviet Union in Iran impossible but the situation of Soviet
                                nationals in Iran had become intolerable. Soviet citizens were not
                                even permitted to study Persian. Indeed Soviet citizens were the
                                victims of “terrorism.” Moreover, any Persian official who deigned
                                to show an attitude of friendly collaboration towards the Soviet
                                Union was promptly eliminated.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister told Sadchikov that if he had any demands to make,
                                would he kindly formulate them in precise manner. Sadchikov replied
                                that he could not do this since the Soviet Union, by making its
                                desires precise, would be interfering in domestic affairs of Iran.
                                Prime Minister replied that the attitude of the Soviet Union towards
                                Iran, whether precise or not, ended up invariably in intervention in
                                internal affairs. Prime Minister emphasized desire of Iran to live
                                at peace with everyone. He vigorously denied Sadchikov’s assertion
                                that “certain foreign powers” had made promises to Iran with regard
                                to compensation from the “next war in which these foreign powers
                                would be the victors.” Prime Minister insisted that Iran had no
                                secret commitments with anyone. Sadchikov then suddenly turned to
                                question of airport at Tabriz which the Americans were building for
                                attack against Russia. Prime Minister replied that there was only
                                primitive <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0184"/>good weather
                                landing field at Tabriz. Sadchikov kept insisting on American use of
                                Iran as <hi rend="italic">place d’armes</hi> for attacking his
                                country.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister reproached Sadchikov for not maintaining contact with
                                Iranians. The Soviet Ambassador and his staff live “locked up” in
                                their Embassy. Prime Minister then appealed to Sadchikov fully to
                                inform his government of everything that he had told him during
                                their conversation. Sadchikov assured Prime Minister that he would
                                do so, adding that he intended on his arrival in the Soviet Union to
                                proceed to sanitarium for one month for treatment. He would then
                                discuss with his government situation as developed in their
                                conversation. He added that it was essential that Iran make some
                                definite gesture to indicate its removal from the Anglo-American
                                camp into position of true friendliness to the Soviet Union.</p>
                            <p>The conversation between the Prime Minister and Sadchikov terminated
                                in economic trivia.</p>
                            <p>That Sadchikov should make allegations re nonexistent American
                                activities at Tabriz airport is height of insincerity since Soviets
                                are Officially very well represented at Tabriz and know everything
                                that is going on.</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister seemed relieved that Sadchikov did not confront him
                                with something in the nature of an ultimatum.</p>

                            <p>2. Pyman said His Majesty’s Government attitude is that it would be
                                extremely undesirable for Iran to conclude such an alliance with UK
                                because of trouble it would cause with USSR and because it is
                                difficult to see what advantage it would be to either Iran or UK.
                                Pyman said it is conceivable that by “alliance” Shah may have had in
                                mind <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0185"/>granting strategic
                                facilities to UK, but this, too, would affect Iranian-Soviet
                                relations adversely and would be likely to produce unnecessary
                                trouble for UK.</p>
                            <p>3. Had Shah raised question His Majesty’s Government would have
                                replied that an alliance would be difficult and complicated matter
                                requiring considerable study.</p>
                            <p>4. Pyman said Top Secret letter on this subject is being sent British
                                Embassy Washington for discussion with Department. He is
                                particularly anxious that classification should be respected.</p>

                                Officer today. He says Razin, Soviet Military Attaché, before his
                                return to Russia made representations to him identical with those
                                made to Prime Minister by Soviet Ambassador (<gloss
                                    target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss> 924 August 5).</p>
                            <p>Razin said in substance: “We are dispersing our industry all over
                                USSR in anticipation of hostilities. These preparations are entirely
                                adequate save in one respect. We cannot disperse Baku. The vast
                                petroleum output of Baku is essential to all parts of Russia. We are
                                not afraid of Iranian Army as such but we are afraid of American
                                attack on Baku through Iran. Therefore we cannot permit the Iranian
                                Army to be integrated with US Army. The arms credit program must
                                therefore be cancelled and the American military advisers must go.
                                If action in this sense is not taken by Iran on basis our
                                representations, we shall be obliged to use other methods.”</p>
                            <p>I remarked to High Staff Officer that the conclusion of Razin’s
                                remarks sounded like a threat. Did Sadjikov similarly threaten Prime

                                threat was made to Prime Minister.</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_HSO1">HSO</gloss> conveyed no impression of
                                perturbation over situation but obviously seeks to use it as

                            <p>1025. Saw Shah for more than two hours yesterday. Almost entire
                                period was devoted to arms credit program with Shah manifesting
                                greatly aggravated discontent. As is inevitably the case in all such
                                conversations with him he persistently raised the question of Turkey
                                with, I think, erroneous and jealously exaggerated ideas of the
                                military and economic aid which the US is furnishing that country.
                                He alleged that it was obvious that in case of war with the Soviet
                                Union we were planning to use airfields in Turkey against the Soviet
                                Union and would let Iran go down the drain. He manifested deepest
                                concern that the US had apparently ignored completely the great
                                strategic importance of his country and felt moreover that we were
                                wasting invaluable time. He went into details as shown in transcript
                                of meeting on August 10 of Iranian purchasing commission with Army
                                and Air Force representatives. He described the furnishing of tanks
                                to Iran with inadequate ammunition as serving no useful purpose. He
                                went on to say that arms credit program as now set up would destroy
                                American prestige and greatly impair the friendship which had been
                                built up in Iran for the US. He regarded the situation as most
                                serious for him and Iran. He had made plans to defend the country
                                against Russian invasion. These plans were completely invalidated by
                                the inadequacy of American help. He had therefore seriously
                                considered changing his policy. He would abandon any idea of
                                organized resistance and in event of aggression against Iran he
                                would tell every Iranian to get his gun and fend for himself. He
                                emphasized and reemphasized what he considered to be the vital
                                importance to the US in the event of war for Iran to be able to
                                impede Soviet access to Absdan and the Persian Gulf.</p>
                            <p>During our conversation I used all possible counter arguments with no
                                apparent success. He is obviously obdurately stubborn. I insisted
                                that he should discuss military matters with General Grow since it
                                was field in which I was not qualified. He will see General Grow
                                tomorrow but he urgently requested that in meantime I inform you of
                                our interview.</p>
                            <p>The state of mind of the Shah is clearly something that should be
                                taken seriously.</p>

                            <p>1041. Forgot to report in <gloss target="#t_mytel1">mytel</gloss>
                                1037 September 2<note n="1" xml:id="d129fn1">Not printed; it
                                    reported information from the British Ambassador to Iran that
                                    while the Shah was in London, he had made Requests for jet
                                    planes, the training of pilots, tanks, and anti-tank guns with
                                    ammunition (891.20/9–248).</note> that Shah also made drive for
                                a large quantity 7.9. I think he talked of three billion rounds.
                                British told him they did not know whether this type small arms
                                ammunition was still available. They promised to investigate.</p>
                            <p>General Grow, chief military mission, received by Shah yesterday
                                afternoon. Grow has reported by telegraph directly. I again saw Shah
                                last night at an official reception. Though Shah apparently showed
                                an even temper and considerable understanding while talking to Grow,
                                with me he continued his plaintive jeremiad. After exhausting
                                question of tank ammunition, he then accusingly asked, “And how
                                about mortars?” Then he complained that he could not fight the
                                Russians with bare hands. Once again he insisted in minatory fashion
                                he would have to change his policy and revise his plans unless he
                                could learn exactly what we planned with regard to Iran. He clearly
                                wants some sort of joint staff work and is still aspiring to greatly
                                increased military assistance. I replied that since the US would
                                under no circumstances ever embark on policy of military aggression
                                our planning was necessarily defensive and that in his case if he
                                had only bare hands with which to defend his country we would expect
                                him in case of foreign aggression to use his bare hands to their
                                best advantage. Regarding arms credit program, I told Shah Iran was
                                getting very much for very little and referred to the fact that
                                program had to be whittled down some 30 percent in order to fit it
                                within the ten million authorized by Majlis. I then added that if by
                                delaying thing’s Iran had missed the big bargain counter rush it was
                                not our fault. Iran <pb n="177" xml:id="pg_177" facs="0191"/>had had
                                every kind of warning from US to strike while iron was hot. I
                                concluded, reminding Shah that Army was prepared gratis to furnish
                                all technical assistance necessary for Iranian procurement through
                                American commercial channels. He then asked “Who provides the money
                                for these purchases?” I answered, “You do”. Shah aggressively
                                retorted that Iran could not possibly finance commercial purchases
                                and he wanted to know what we would do about it. I explained very
                                patiently that we were not now in position to do anything about
                                it.</p>
                            <p>What the Shah discussed in London in the way of military equipment
                                and training would run into astronomical figures yet I have been
                                unable to obtain any indication that the question of financing was
                                even touched upon with the British. I shall discreetly make further
                                inquiries.</p>
                            <p>His attitude towards execution of our arms credit program is, I
                                think, unreasonable. Possibly moment has come for Shah to receive
                                gentle harpoon therapy. Perhaps instead of overlap of Grow and
                                successor the announcement of nomination Grow’s replacement and his
                                arrival might be slightly retarded. Such step might have wholesome
                                but noncommittal effect on thinking of Shah and Chief of Staff
                                General Razmara. Naturally, if Shah does not disclose his military
                                initiatives to advisory military mission, latter’s functions become
                                impossible of successful accomplishment.</p>
                            <p>I am unfavorably impressed that Shah has been entirely reticent with
                                us regarding his conversations in England. He is obviously entirely
                                unconscious of intimate US–UK relationship and retains traditional
                                Persian conviction that unique policy is that of playing off one
                                great power against another.</p>
                            <p>Wish to add that Shah last night reproached Military Attaché Colonel
                                Sexton that US had failed to live up to its promises. [Here follows
                                a personal observation.]</p>

                            <p>This Government would view with serious concern any action by Iran
                                which would have the effect of prejudicing the security of the
                                Persian Gulf area, or of aggravating unrest in that strategic part
                                of the world. Any attempt by the Iranian Government to press
                                formally or to place its claims to Bahrein before an international
                                forum might, in the opinion of the Department, will have such
                                effects. In this connection it will be recalled that American
                                representatives in Iran have taken every opportunity during recent
                                years to persuade the Iranian Government of the unwisdom of publicly
                                airing its asserted claims to Bahrein.</p>
                            <p>The Department has studied the memoranda prepared by the India Office
                                and the Foreign Office concerning the historical and modern <pb

                                    August 27 were two historical memoranda prepared in the India
                                    Office, which carried the story concerning Bahrein to the end of
                                    1946 and copies of notes exchanged with the Persian Government
                                    and the League of Nations from 1927 to 1934. These papers are
                                    not found attached.</note> Several studies have been prepared in
                                the Department during the past few years bearing upon this same
                                subject, which have also resulted in the conclusion that the Iranian
                                claim would be legally untenable if it were submitted to an
                                international body for judicial decision. However, the Department
                                concurs in the view of the Foreign Office that the present state of
                                international relations and the composition of the International
                                Court make it impossible to predict with certainty the nature of the
                                Court’s decision on the question of Bahrain if this issue were
                                referred to it for an advisory opinion.</p>
                            <p>The Department agrees in principle with the four recommendations of
                                the Foreign Office as to the course which should be pursued by Great
                                Britain and the United States, namely: (1) that we should not raise
                                the question in any international forum; (2) that we should continue
                                to discourage Iran from raising it in any manner; (3) that if Iran,
                                nevertheless, raises it in the United Nations, we should hope that
                                this would be in the Security Council rather than the General
                                Assembly; (4) that, if the matter should be raised either in the
                                Security Council or the General Assembly, it would be best to try to
                                direct the meeting towards a request for an advisory opinion from
                                the International Court.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the recommendation of the Foreign Office that the
                                United States and Great Britain continue to discourage the Iranian
                                Government from raising its claim, it is suggested that the Foreign
                                Office give consideration to the possible desirability of a parallel
                                formal approach to the Iranian Government by the British and United
                                States Governments. Such an approach might emphasize the following
                                points: (1) in our opinion the asserted Iranian claim is wholly
                                untenable both on political and legal grounds; (2) we believe that
                                the raising of the Bahrein question by Iran would lead to
                                undesirable and fruitless disagreement with the United States and
                                the United Kingdom, would have markedly unfavorable repercussions in
                                the Arab States, and would redound only to the benefit of the USSR;
                                (3) if Iran should raise the Bahrein question before any
                                international forum, we would be obliged strenuously to oppose such
                                Iranian claim.</p>
                            <p>In the event that Iran, despite such advice, should decide to submit
                                the Bahrein issue to the United Nations, this Government would be
                                prepared to lend strong support to a resolution requesting an
                                advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice. It is not,
                                however, proposed that the Iranian Government be so informed.</p>
                            <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0195"/>
                            <p>The Department believes that a formal approach as outlined above
                                would have considerable influence in deterring the Iranian
                                Government from an ill-advised course with respect to Bahrein, and
                                that it would serve as a matter of record for future Iranian
                                cabinets which might contemplate action in this regard. It is felt,
                                however, that the proposed approach should not be made unless a
                                situation should arise which appears to necessitate such action.
                                Such a situation might be created if the Iranian Government, acting
                                on its own initiative or under stimulus of irredentist propaganda or
                                because of Soviet pressure, should decide to press the Bahrein
                                issue. It is more probable, however, that a situation justifying
                                Anglo-American action may be precipitated when the proposals of the
                                British and United States Governments concerning jurisdiction and
                                control over the submarine resources of the Persian Gulf are
                                presented to Iran and other littoral states. It is, therefore,
                                suggested that the, proposed approach, to Iran be made at that time
                                if the Iranian reaction should appear to justify such action.</p>
                            <p>The views of the Foreign Office concerning the Department’s proposal
                                and the question of its timing would be greatly appreciated. In view
                                of the contemplated approach to the littoral states of the Persian.
                                Gulf in the near future with respect to offshore oil rights, it
                                would, seem advisable for the British and American Governments to
                                arrive at a final decision concerning the question of Bahrein at the
                                earliest possible date.</p>

                            <p>1117. In conversation Sunday afternoon with Minister of War Ahmedi, I
                                was informed Iranian Government desired continuation <gloss
                                    target="#t_ARMISH1">ARMISH</gloss> contract and had instructed
                                Iranian Embassy Washington so to inform Department before Tuesday,
                                September 21. Ahmedi added Iranians would propose certain changes,
                                in agreement which he would outline, in detail to <gloss
                                    target="#t_MA1">MA</gloss> Department on Monday. When he did so,
                                changes turned out to be so far-reaching that I am certain they will
                                not be acceptable to Department and Army, and have so informed
                                Ministry of War. Principal modification would be in Article 24 but
                                changes are also, proposed in articles 1, 5, 8, 10 and 12. I believe
                                we should firmly resist any changes at this time.</p>
                            <p>Foreign Office official Yekta asked Secretary of Embassy Wilson to
                                call yesterday just before closing time and showed draft of note to

                                later in day in above sense. He confirmed sending of instructions to
                                Embassy Washington. On my instructions Wilson stated proposed
                                modifications would not be satisfactory.</p>

                            <p>During the course of a conversation with Ambassador Ala today—at the
                                Embassy, in view of his continued illness—the following points of
                                interest emerged:</p>
                            <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Ambassador stated that he wished to convey to me
                                    informally the purpose of the conference presently planned for
                                    Monday, October 4, between Mr. Ebtehaj and himself for the
                                    Iranian Embassy and Mr. Satterthwaite and other officers for the
                                    Department. I was informed that Mr. Ebtehaj will wish to discuss
                                    political and military, as well as economic, aspects of
                                    U.S.-Iranian relations; in particular Mr. Ebtehaj and Ambassador
                                    Ala will inform the Department that the Government of Iran
                                    wishes to clarify its foreign policy, making clear its
                                    disposition no longer to placate the Russians or to pursue a
                                    policy of balance but to commit itself definitely to the cause
                                    of the western powers. In taking this new, positive position,
                                    Iran would, according to Ambassador Ala, be following the
                                    example of Turkey. Ambassador Ala explained that he had for long
                                    recommended this course of action to His Majesty the Shah and
                                    that Mr. Ebtehaj has also shared these views. It appears that
                                    the Shah and Prime Minister Hajir are now prepared to act
                                    affirmatively on these recommendations. It was understood that
                                    Iran’s new policy of commitment to the western democracies would
                                    soon be confirmed officially in Tehran by publicly announced
                                    requests for U.S. assistance to meet Soviet threats, “like
                                    Turkey”.</item>

                                <item>Against a background analysis of Iran’s important strategic
                                    position, which was considered similar to that of Turkey, the
                                    Ambassador said that his government was about to make specific
                                    requests <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0197"/>of the U.S. In
                                    the military line, Iran would request more U.S. officers “to
                                    reform the Iranian Army”, apparently by detailing U.S. military
                                    personnel to the divisional level. It is the hope of the Iranian
                                    Government that Iran might be so equipped as to offer effective
                                    delaying action to the Soviet Union in the event of
                                    hostilities.</item>

                                <item>Overall political assistance will be sought through the medium
                                    of a regional pact which Ambassador Ala envisaged as comprising
                                    Iran and eastern Mediterranean states. The Ambassador has had
                                    several talks with the Turkish Ambassador in Washington and at
                                    least one conversation with the Greeks and Egyptians. The
                                    purpose of such regional arrangement, in effect an extension of
                                    the Saadabad Pact, would be mutual defense. Its effectiveness
                                    would depend upon the extension of the Marshall Plan aid. The
                                    Ambassador referred to recent press reports of Ambassador
                                    Griffis’ statement in Cairo.</item>

                                <item>Economic assistance through established media will be sought
                                    from the International Bank, with which Mr. Ebtehaj has already
                                    been in conversation; the Eximbank, covering credits for
                                    agricultural machinery; Smith–Mundt Act arrangements for the
                                    detail of U.S. Government and other technicians; and U.S.
                                    private investment in local Iranian enterprise under Iranian
                                    Government guidance. The Ambassador stated that he would like
                                    the Department’s views concerning the Prime Minister’s request
                                    to Mr. Wiley with regard to possible credits up to $80 million
                                    covering consumer goods for the purpose of reducing the cost of
                                    living in Iran. I referred to the observations which Ambassador
                                    Wiley had made to the Prime Minister in Tehran, together with
                                    considerations of our financial experts in Washington which
                                    recommended against the economic validity of such a means for
                                    achieving the admittedly worthwhile objective.</item>

                                <item>In view of the prospect of Mr. Ebtehaj and Ambassador Ala
                                    making elaborate requests for U.S. assistance along the above
                                    lines, I reminded the Ambassador that American resources were
                                    not unlimited; that we appreciated the desire of other free
                                    nations to associate themselves with the western democracies in
                                    opposing the spread of Communist totalitarianism; that this
                                    government was disposed to share its resources, insofar as
                                    possible, with foreign governments pursuing a similar policy;
                                    that this government, in the final analysis, had to take
                                    responsibility for deciding where and when its assistance might
                                    best be accorded; that the wisdom of its decisions had been
                                    demonstrated by situations which have developed and are emerging
                                    abroad at the present time; that U.S. assistance in all events
                                    was premised upon the conscientious effort of recipient
                                    countries to make every contribution to their defense possible
                                    within their own competence; and that, in the case of Iran, we
                                    were conscious of our commitment under the Tehran
                                    Declaration.</item>

                                <item>Concerning the Shah’s expressed desire to visit the U.S., the
                                    Ambassador stated that His Majesty wishes to come in the spring,
                                    but that Ambassador Wiley has suggested next September as more
                                    advisable. When asked the Department’s views in this connection,
                                    I told the Ambassador that we had long been of the opinion that
                                    the mutual interests of our two countries would be well served
                                    by a visit from the Shah at the earliest appropriate opportunity

                                result of my conversation with Shah he and General Razmara Chief of
                                Staff studied army mission contract in detail. Two days ago Razmara
                                informed Colonel Sexton that only point of issue was a minor change
                                in Article 4 which is acceptable, and elimination of Article 24
                                which is, we think, completely unacceptable. Razmara categorically
                                stated that Iranian law required submission of contract to Majlis
                                and due to local political conditions it could not possibly pass.
                                He, speaking for the Shah, suggested submission of present contract
                                less Article 24 to the Majlis with Article 24 being covered by a
                                secret exchange of letters.</p>
                            <p>I consider such procedure inacceptable and yesterday at lunch with
                                Razmara it was brought out that he was acting under instructions
                                from the Shah who, he reluctantly admitted, opposed Article 24.
                                Unquestionably the Shah’s opposition is based on his hope of
                                obtaining British equipment and instructors as a result of his
                                London conversations. The Shah’s intent apparently is to shop for
                                munitions and although I am convinced there is no Russian influence
                                involved, the Shah is guilty of undue reticence in informing us of
                                his plans and possibly intends if his plans proceed to establish a
                                supplementary British mission here.</p>
                            <p>It was made plain to Razmara that if our mission is to remain in Iran
                                there would be no change in the mission contract. He was advised
                                that if the Iranians deem it necessary to submit the contract as
                                written to the Majlis, we would certainly make no objection, but
                                that many <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0199"/>complications
                                would be avoided if the renewal could be arranged by an executive
                                exchange of letters. He was told that according to our
                                interpretation of the basic act authorizing the mission, further
                                submission to the Majlis is unnecessary. He promised to study the
                                matter and get in touch with Colonel Sexton on Saturday
                                (unquestionably after he has talked to the Shah who returns from
                                Isfahan that day).<note n="2" xml:id="d135fn2">Ambassador Wiley
                                    expressed his conclusion, in telegram 1174, October 5, to the
                                    Department that the “crux of matter is Shah’s desire introduce
                                    British Air Mission into Iran in connection his Vampire plane
                                    program.” Later in the same message, he advised of information
                                    from Ambassador Le Rougetel that the British reply to the
                                    Iranian request would be along the following lines: “(<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) Due to world situation, short-range
                                    planning is predominate over long-range planning and it is
                                    impossible to state at this time whether Vampires will be
                                    available in 1950 or not. Matter of jet pilot training program
                                    is equally problematical. <p>“(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                        However, British Government desires cooperate with Shah’s
                                        wishes in every respect and has placed jet matter before
                                        Combined Chiefs of Staff. If Britain is unable furnish jet
                                        planes to Iran, possibility their being supplied by US will
                                        be explored.</p>
                                    <p>“(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) If at the appropriate time it is
                                        determined jets are available from both UK and US, Shah will
                                        be free to choose which he prefers.” (891.20

                                        Ebtehaj on October 4. The latter stated that the “Shah,
                                        Hajir, Ala, and other responsible Iranians shared his
                                        conviction that Iran should abandon ‘neutral’ policy toward
                                        Great Powers and commit Itself openly to cause of Western
                                        democracies. He feels Iran at present suffers all
                                        liabilities of contemplated alignment (i.e., Soviet
                                        opprobrium) without commensurate benefits (i.e., assurance
                                        US aid).” The Department officers gave the Iranians the
                                        substance of telegram 948, which Mr. Ebtehaj called “one of

                                advantage of Shah’s visit to UK they would like to make available a

                                as early as Iranians could be trained to fly jets. According Pyman,

                                deeply concerned by his plan for constitutional reform. I said I was
                                not disturbed by plans themselves but by timing. This was, I said,
                                the moment of the 28th veto.<note n="1" xml:id="d141fn1">Presumably

                                    advised that “At present moment in world situation, I think Shah
                                    would be well advised to concentrate on foreign affairs and
                                    control of army both of which at present he has fairly firmly in
                                    his hands, and postpone his ideas for far-reaching changes in
                                    domestic political structure and let government retain primary
                                    responsibility for social and economic reforms.”
                                    (891.00/10–2748)</note>) should be foreign affairs and national
                                defence, both of which are firmly in his hands. To take an
                                initiative that would jeopardize his position, would, I thought,
                                [be] unnecessarily hazardous. In other words, I urged Shah not to
                                use threat of abdication (<gloss target="#t_Embtel1">Embtel</gloss>

                                weapon with which to coerce Majlis. I added that psychologically a
                                threat was not good political instrument.</p>
                            <p>Shah remained unhappy and noncommittal. It is clear he has his mind
                                very definitely made up to correct a situation which has been unduly
                                exaggerated in his thinking.</p>

                                ground, reiterating that as I had made clear to Shah, I had no

                                though moment was inopportune for drastic political initiative and
                                repeated to Prime Minister that I felt Shah should concentrate on
                                foreign affairs and national defence. Referring to Shah’s apparent
                                intention to give a four months’ ultimatum to the Majlis before
                                abdicating, I suggested that during four months in question the
                                enemies of Iran and opponents of present dynasty would be given an
                                opportunity to carry out an effective propaganda and agitational
                                campaign, which Shah had apparently had no plans for combating.
                                Prime Minister expressed his enthusiastic approval that Shah’s
                                proposed initiative should be postponed.</p>

                                the interested agencies of the government.</p>
                            <p>Your letter and the enclosed memorandum have been brought to the
                                attention of the competent officers of the Department, who are
                                informing the other appropriate agencies of the government.</p>
                            <p>I am authorized to inform you that the Department believes this
                                question should be given further attention and would be glad to
                                receive from you a detailed analysis of all factors bearing on it,
                                together with such detailed plans as it may be possible for your
                                staff to prepare and such further general observations and
                                recommendations as you may wish to submit. The Department requests
                                that, for the time being, you refrain from discussing with the Shah
                                the possible formation of a “free government” or resistance
                                movement. It is feared that any approach you might make in this
                                regard would be taken by the Iranians as an implied promise of
                                American support and assistance in executing the suggested plan,
                                whereas the appropriate agencies in Washington have not yet had an
                                opportunity to give even initial consideration to the question.
                                Furthermore, it seems likely that any discussion with the Shah of
                                plans for a resistance movement would lead into broader questions of
                                the role Iran plays in American strategic thinking and the political
                                and military guarantees or assurances which we are willing to give
                                that country. We are not yet prepared to answer such questions in
                                any manner which could be expected to satisfy the Shah. We believe
                                any decisions as to the time or manner of approach to the Iranian
                                authorities or other elements who might take part in a resistance
                                movement should be deferred until the American Government has
                                decided whether it is desirable to encourage and support such a
                                movement when and if the need arises. It is felt that this decision
                                cannot be made until we have received from you a further analysis
                                and a more detailed plan, including the military and intelligence
                                plans referred to in Mr. Dooher’s memorandum.</p>
                            <p>The Department would like to have your views regarding the
                                desirability of consultation with the British Government on this
                                subject. On preliminary consideration, it appears to us that the
                                British should be brought into the picture at some early stage, in
                                view of our community of policy in Iran, the important political
                                influence of the British in Iran, and the intimate knowledge of the
                                country and wide experience in dealing with all elements of its
                                population possessed by officials of the British government. Since
                                the British have such large material interests at stake and are in
                                such close contact with many segments of the population, including
                                especially the southern tribes, it would seem that failure to
                                coordinate with them in advance of the <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194"
                                    facs="0208"/>anticipated emergency might result in great
                                confusion as well as neglect of the real positive contribution which
                                they might be able to make. We will, however, take no action with
                                respect to the British pending receipt of your recommendations.</p>
                            <p>We await with much interest your further reports on this important
                                subject.</p>

                                opinion that “we go a good deal further than we have in the past in
                                rebutting instantly and vigorously false and vituperative
                                allegations by the Soviet Union and that we should never under any

                                the present case the allegation is made officially.” (<gloss

                                    >reftel</gloss>, I can appreciate that our denials might be more

                            <p>In any case, I consider Iran the most sensitive point on the Soviet
                                periphery requiring our most continuous and careful attention. Lack
                                of oil in sufficient quantities for modern warfare is probably the
                                most serious weakness in Soviet war potential and one likely to
                                become more marked as the USSR acquires (from Italy) and builds the
                                fleet it obviously wants to increase its strength and influence in
                                the <gloss target="#t_Black1">Black</gloss> Sea and Mid-East areas.
                                Not only is the oil to cover this shortage available in Iran, but
                                also the simultaneous possibility of large-scale denial of Mid-East
                                oil to the Western Powers. Moreover, the instability and
                                ineffectiveness of the Iranian Government and its lack of the same
                                direct US support extended to Greece and Turkey inevitably aggravate
                                the constant temptation for the Kremlin to go after this prize.</p>

                            <p>Soviet charges re alleged American military activities in Iran are
                                being repeated and expanded daily in ever accelerated and shriller
                                tempo by Soviet radio and press. Ambassador Sadchikov has returned
                                to Tehran. Simultaneously a large Rumanian diplomatic set-up has
                                arrived, dedicated to Cominform activities. Policy of frontier
                                incursions has been vigorously revived by the USSR. Then our arms
                                credit program is on very eve of being implemented, something which
                                Soviet Military Attaché says his government will under no
                                circumstances tolerate. I therefore feel more strongly than ever
                                that the situation, irrespective of what Iran may or may not do,
                                compels that we immediately refute in the most vigorous, forthright
                                and official manner entirely false and fantastic Soviet accusations
                                which have been made over so long a period with obviously carefully
                                planned, ominous and evil intentions. We should no longer hesitate
                                but act at once. We may have no time to lose. It is in my opinion of
                                secondary importance when or how Iran acts.</p>

                            <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0211"/>
                            <p>In event of war with Soviet Union involving Iran and US, Iran may be
                                assumed of all assistance compatible with US resources in a global
                                conflict. It must be clear from recent history that US devotes its
                                full and unrelenting power, in cooperation with its loyal allies, to
                                achieve total victory over those who bring war to the world. On our
                                part, we have complete confidence as to favorable outcome of any
                                future conflict in which US may be involved.</p>
                            <p>US is, naturally, interested in Iranian defense capabilities. In
                                event of war of Soviet aggression, USSR, would enjoy initial
                                advantages accruing to aggressor.</p>
                            <p>It is logical therefore that Iranians formulate their plans on basis
                                of resistance as effective and prolonged as possible, including, if
                                necessary, extensive and extended guerrilla-type warfare.</p>
                            <p>If pressed by Razmara or if you think it necessary, you may say we
                                cannot be more specific in our advice or assurances<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d146fn1">The Department, on October 28, had instructed

                            <p>All above predicated on assumption that U.S. as well as Iran is at
                                war with USSR. It does not answer question, which we understand
                                Razmara is not raising, namely, whether U.S. would go to war
                                immediately if Iran were attacked by USSR.</p>
                            <p>All communications to Iranians this subj should be oral. Nothing

                                speak “plainly and clearly” to State and Army Depts re plans Shah
                                and Govt if Iran attacked.</p>
                            <p>Instructions emphasized Iranian orientation to West, necessity of
                                “strengthening the line”, and of putting Iran, through provision
                                adequate materiel, in position join resisting Soviet attack. Ala
                                said Shah and Govt “are determined to defend home soil and desire to
                                join in resisting any aggression undertaken by Soviet”.</p>
                            <p>In presenting case Mazhari said history of Azerbaijan and oil
                                concessions proved Iranians are capable resisting Soviet pressures
                                and worthy of independence. Therefore US should now give Iran
                                assistance comparable to that provided China, Turkey and Greece. He
                                emphasized vulnerability of Iran, strategic importance and potential
                                as anchor for defensive line extending eastward from Belgium through
                                Turkey to Himalayas. He said he was prepared discuss matter with and

                            <p>Ala mentioned Dept previously advised caution to avoid provoking
                                Russians. However, Iran had already given Russians various reasons
                                to be provoked including rejection of oil agreement and recent

                                strictly secret. If Shah recd indication US willingness assist he
                                would consult <gloss target="#t_PriMin1">PriMin</gloss>, Council

                                Ala said “Majlis and people are absolutely and entirely in favor
                                defending Iran”. He stressed however that Shah must have advance

                            <p>Dept pointed out no defensive line existed and Amer aid to various

                                to be frank and open in discussing problems involved, he may often
                                appear negative. In conversations where consideration given such a

                                effect on Amer economy must be weighed (demands are far larger than
                                US can hope to meet); strategic questions must obviously be studied

                                        communication refuting Soviet charges against US and
                                        supporting Iran position that any alleged threat against
                                        Soviet Union from Iran should be referred to Security
                                        Council. We naturally wish to know in advance position Iran
                                        will take in order be sure we can conscientiously support
                                        it. (This connection we have never had clarification of

                                Highness said he was glad learn US Government felt this way as he
                                believed satisfactory revision Anglo-Iraqi Treaty would be important
                                factor in promoting stability Middle East. As result progress made
                                in preliminary discussions with British, he was hopeful that
                                mutually beneficial agreement would be reached during Prime
                                Minister’s visit to UK. Weather permitting Prime Minister was
                                scheduled depart January 6.</p>
                            <p>I mentioned that local press and several prominent political leaders
                                had been bitterly attacking government for Iraq’s treaty
                                relationship with Great Britain and had been demanding that no
                                arrangement be made that would infringe Iraq’s “sovereignty and full
                                independence”. His Royal Highness responded by saying that treaty
                                revision was designed to benefit both countries and that “my people
                                must take into consideration the realities” of existing conditions
                                in the world which for security reasons requires sound treaty
                                relationship of this nature with friendly power.</p>

                                clashed with the police. The following day, an Iraqi delegation

                            </p>
                            <p>Prince Feisal said he had in mind that Britain should conclude
                                treaties with other Arab states by which they would all be treated
                                alike, and in particular Hashimite states should not be favored.
                                Proposed British-<gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> treaty went
                                beyond this idea. He added British Ambassador had been recently
                                Riyadh and was returning there on twenty-seventh when Feisal himself
                                expected to be there. It was very likely British proposals would be
                                discussed in detail at that time. In view fact that US was closest
                                foreign government to Saudi Arabia Prince Feisal had come to Jidda
                                to acquaint me with foregoing and asked if I had any comments.</p>
                            <p>I said I had two: (1) I felt my government would be most gratified
                                with confidence reposed in it by <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                >SAG</gloss>; (2) I felt my government would be favorably disposed
                                toward conclusion of any treaty arrangements by <gloss
                                    target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> which promoted peace and security
                                in Middle East without touching <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                >SAG</gloss>’s independence and liberty of action. I said any other
                                comments would have to come from my government.</p>
                            <p>Feisal said in view of Riyadh meeting on twenty-seventh it was most
                                important His Majesty have by that time any comments which US <pb
                                    n="213" xml:id="pg_213" facs="0227"/>Government might have to
                                make on the problem as he had outlined it to me. I promised I would
                                communicate urgently with my government and would endeavor to have
                                reply before he left for Riyadh.</p>
                            <p>Department will find foregoing development at variance with my
                                estimate situation in Legtels 16, January 13 and 23, January

                                    expects to receive comments (and very likely approval) of all
                                    interested British Departments on Friday, January 23. Thereafter

                                Department, to even greater extent than re Iraqi negotiations, would
                                probably like to have comprehensive information re draft treaty and
                                negotiations with <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>. Pyman said
                                Foreign Office has this very much in mind and consequently is
                                sending Department preliminary British draft. Trott has been
                                instructed to keep Minister Childs fully in picture.</p>
                            <p>6. After King sees draft it will be decided whether negotiations will
                                be in London with Feisal, due here February 5, or in Riyadh.</p>
                            <p>7. Foreign Office appreciates Department’s helpful preliminary
                                reaction to idea negotiation Anglo-Saudi treaty telegraphed by
                                British Embassy, Washington, and hopes to receive at early date
                                Department’s second thoughts, particularly re Dhahran area. Embassy
                                believes Department has unusual opportunity at this stage to make
                                full Department thinking available to Foreign Office. After draft is
                                handed Ibn Saud January 28, communication problem will make it
                                difficult, even for Foreign Office’s last minute ideas, to be taken
                                into account.</p>

                            <p>Minister Childs, on January 24, sent a note to King Ibn Saud which
                                read: “I have great honor referring Your Majesty’s communication of
                                    <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0230"/>December 13, 1947. I
                                duly communicated full text Your Majesty’s communication to me to my
                                Government by telegram. I am now in receipt telegram dated January
                                23, 1948 stating careful consideration being given by my Government
                                Your Majesty’s request for training mission and reply would be
                                communicated as soon as decision may be formulated. It is added
                                urgent attention being given this question”. On February 2, Amir
                                Faisal handed to the Minister the King’s reply of January 31, in the
                                form of a memorandum. The King called attention to his request of
                                the previous December for a military mission and stated that it was
                                “unreasonable” for the United States to provide such a mission
                                without furnishing arms and other essentials for training Saudi
                                Arabian forces (telegram 46, February 3, 10 p. m., from Jidda,
                                890F.20 Missions/2–348).</p>
                            <p>Jidda, on February 3, transmitted a translation of a second
                                memorandum from the King in telegram 45, not printed. The date of
                                the second memorandum was not given. It declared that the British
                                had encouraged the Iraqis to agitate and propagandize “against us”,
                                in order to disturb relations, between the United States and Saudi
                                Arabia. The memorandum declared it “almost certain” that the purpose
                                of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was to move Saudi Arabia away from the
                                United States and to place it in a position where the British would
                                easily gain “what they desire”. It then requested the United States
                                to prepare a statement of its attitude regarding these matters and
                                to state whether it was prepared to come to an “understanding” and
                                “agreement” with Saudi Arabia to preserve its sovereign
                                interests.</p>
                            <p>At the time that Amir Faisal handed the two memoranda from King Ibn
                                Saud to Minister Childs, he stated that Saudi refusal to conclude a
                                treaty with the British might result in their use of the Hashemites
                                to create a disturbed situation. It was to guard against such an
                                eventuality that the King desired to strengthen his realm. Minister
                                Childs pointed out the previous assurances of the United States to
                                support unqualifiedly the territorial integrity and the political
                                independence of Saudi Arabia. The Amir Faisal replied that he was
                                seeking something more practical than these assurances, namely the
                                supplying by the United States of the military requirements
                                essential to defending Saudi sovereignty and maintaining internal
                                stability (telegram 47, February 3, 10 p. m., from Jidda).</p>
                            <p>The Department, on February 9, authorized Jidda to inform the King,
                                if he brought up the subject discussed in telegram 47, that “we are
                                convinced Brit are not inciting Iraq into acts unfriendly to Saudi
                                Arabia” (telegram 35). The telegrams cited above are filed under
                                741.90F/2–348.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Trott notified Minister Childs that he had discussed the
                                proposed Anglo-Saudi treaty with Saudi officials and then with <pb
                                    n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0231"/>the King. Ibn Saud “stated
                                in effect he would have none of it. Trolls was able to pacify him in
                                explaining draft was tentative one which would be left with King for
                                study”. The Ambassador suggested further discussion after the King’s
                                examination (telegram 38, January 30, 3 p. m., from Jidda,
                                741.90F/1–3048).</p>

                            <p>The text of a proposed treaty between the British Government and the
                                Government of Saudi Arabia has been sent to the Department by the
                                American Embassy in London, where it had been received from the
                                British Foreign Office. This treaty is almost identical with the
                                treaty signed last week at Portsmouth, England, between the United
                                Kingdom and Iraq, a treaty whose terms have stirred up such
                                resentment in Iraq that it may not be ratified.</p>
                            <p>From the American point of view, the most important clauses in this
                                proposed treaty (a copy of which is attached)<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d167fn1">Not found attached to file copy.</note> are to
                                be found in the Annexure, Article 1. This reads in part: “His
                                Majesty the King of Saudi Arabia and His Britannic Majesty will each
                                appoint expert delegates, who will meet together … to agree upon the
                                essential strategic installations whose construction and maintenance
                                are necessary to enable His Britannic Majesty to discharge his
                                obligations . . . . His Britannic Majesty will meet the cost of
                                construction of these essential strategic installations and, in
                                order to maintain them at all times, whether of peace or of war, in
                                the necessary state of operational efficiency, His Britannic Majesty
                                will provide the necessary technical staff and equipment, and … will
                                meet the cost of such, maintenance.” The treaty sets up a Joint
                                Defence Board which will determine “which are the essential
                                strategic installations” to be constructed or maintained by the
                                British.</p>
                            <p>As you are aware, the oil resources of Saudi Arabia are being
                                developed by the Arabian American Oil Company, a wholly owned
                                American corporation, which has brought four oilfields into
                                production, erected a refinery, and built a town of 4,000 Americans
                                along with a network of highways, powerlines and other public
                                utilities. A deep water pier is being built on the Persian Gulf and
                                a railroad pushed inland across the oil coast by this firm. The
                                Airport at Dhahran, which <pb n="218" xml:id="pg_218" facs="0232"
                                />was built by the US armed forces and completed in 1946, is now
                                being operated by the Air Transport Command, in an Agreement with
                                the Government of Saudi Arabia which lasts until March of 1949.
                                Furthermore, there is a US Air Force Mission now at Dhahran training
                                a selected group of Saudi Arabian students to operate this airport.
                                The Saudi Arabian Airlines is American operated and American firms
                                are carrying on an extensive development program throughout Saudi
                                Arabia. In contrast to this, British interests in that country are
                                of minor importance.</p>
                            <p>King Ibn Saud has repeatedly asked for closer military and economic
                                ties with the US. Only a month ago he requested American mechanized
                                equipment and airplanes, and an American training mission to enable
                                him to adequately protect the American pipeline to the Mediterranean
                                and the oilfields on the Persian Gulf.<note n="2" xml:id="d167fn2"
                                    >This request was conveyed to the Department in telegram 568,

                                armed services apparently desire to retain a preeminent position in
                                Saudi Arabia, they have thus far been unwilling to meet the King’s
                                requests. It is now obvious that something concrete in the way of a
                                training mission or materiel, or both, will have to be provided
                                Saudi Arabia if our position there is to be maintained in the face
                                of this British offer of an alliance plus technical personnel.
                                Because of its implication to the American position in the area, we
                                have asked the British to defer negotiations on this treaty with the
                                Government of Saudi Arabia until the views of the US Armed Services
                                can be obtained.<note n="3" xml:id="d167fn3">The request was made in

                                Armed Services.</p>
                            <p>With respect to proposed Anglo-Saudi treaty you should inform King
                                that both US and UK have common purpose of promoting security of
                                Middle East and of supporting political independence and territorial
                                integrity of all countries of that area including Saudi Arabia. In
                                principle, therefore, US would view with sympathy security
                                arrangements entered into between <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                    >SAG</gloss> and Brit for purpose of achieving this aim,

                                arrangements to be in Saudi interest, (2) such arrangements are not
                                inconsistent with. US-Saudi agreement regarding Dhahran Airbase, (3)
                                such an arrangement would not preclude free development of political
                                military and economic relations between Saudi Arabia and US, and (4)
                                such arrangements would be in harmony with UN charter.</p>
                            <p>As regards specific Saudi request above mentioned, you should state
                                US regards security of Middle East and particularly of Saudi Arabia
                                as necessary for maintenance of world peace and desires to implement
                                its attitude as concretely as possible. At this particular moment

                                    >SAG</gloss>’s suggestion of difficulty reaching decision at
                                present time will make it easier to point out our own
                                difficulties.</p>

                                is in all our dealings with <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>, I
                                would feel very hopeful in being able persuade King to request us to
                                remain at Dhahran after March 1949. King, however, as Department
                                aware, is under heavy attack in Arab world for what is regarded
                                already as his excessive leniency toward US interests, in view of
                                what is regarded as our hostility to Arab world by our Palestine
                                policy. Even if he desired us remain Dhahran, as he probably does,
                                after that date he is likely find it particularly difficult make
                                such request at this extremely unpropitious moment.</p>
                            <p>I see no reason, however, why subject should not be explored with
                                him. It is entirely possible he may feel question of extension
                                should remain in abeyance for some months until Palestine issue has
                                become clearer and our own relation to Arab world better defined in
                                Arab eyes. I think it important that we make plain our interest in
                                assisting him to the extent of spending considerable sums Dhahran
                                and, as such expenditure obviously cannot be made if our occupancy
                                at Dhahran is to be terminated next year, it seems desirable from
                                point of view of indicating to King our willingness assist him, that
                                question of airport agreement be raised.</p>

                            <p>76. [The first seven paragraphs conveyed word from Minister Childs
                                that he had given to King Ibn Saud a memorandum containing the
                                comments of the United States Government on the proposed Anglo-Saudi
                                treaty, as set forth in Department’s telegram 32, February 6, and
                                that he had summarized the memorandum at the request of the King.
                                The latter was said to have “expressed great satisfaction” and then
                                to have expounded his views on Hashemite machinations and on his
                                rejection of the “humiliating” treaty with the British. He then
                                sought, by the next day, the views of the Minister on these
                                subjects.]</p>
                            <p>I replied I would give him my views at once explaining when I was
                                doubtful about matters he raised with me I always told him so but I
                                felt able give him comments at once without necessity deliberation.
                                I could say that at the beginning of His Majesty’s remarks I was
                                somewhat fearful but I had been reassured by what he said concerning
                                desirability of our working in close concert with British. I had <pb
                                    n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0237"/>every reason to believe my
                                government had been at great pains assure itself British were not
                                lending themselves Hashemite intrigues against His Majesty. US was
                                deeply concerned with interests of Saudi Arabia. I could assure him
                                that fact and I could assure him likewise we would not advise him to
                                pursue policies we did not conceive to be in his interest. We had
                                strong common interests. We were also convinced we could best serve
                                his interests and our own by working in close contact with British.
                                In doing so we were pursuing the course consonant with his own
                                interests and ours. I emphasized I had no doubt these were the views
                                of my government and I therefore did not need time for reflection to
                                inform His Majesty that the views I had expressed concerning the
                                desirability of our working closely together with British in concert
                                with him represented the considered views of US as well as my own
                                personal objective views.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty stated that while he adhered strongly to his friendship
                                for Britain they could not always be trusted and reverted to thought
                                they might attempt egg on Hashemites to adventures in western Saudi
                                Arabia. I then recalled that under instructions my government I had
                                communicated with him after my last visit in December (letter
                                December 13 for which see Legations despatch 434, December 15<note
                                    n="1" xml:id="d171fn1">Not printed.</note>) and had assured him
                                of my government’s unqualified support of territorial integrity and
                                political independence Saudi Arabia. If, therefore, he had at any
                                time any apprehensions with reference to British Hashemite designs
                                he had only to communicate them to my government for necessary
                                appropriate action and I could assure him we meant what we said.</p>
                            <p>His Majesty’s eyes sparkled and he said “I have no doubt about
                                that”.</p>
                            <p>I have rarely seen him in so pleasant a mood. He was obviously
                                pleased. When I began to proceed with question military aid he said
                                “time is now late. I wish you’d discuss at length with Fuad Bey and
                                after that we can review together tomorrow.”<note n="2"

                                After informal exploratory discussion with Fuad Bey Hamza<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d172fn1">Saudi Arabian Minister of State.</note> who in
                                turn consulted King it was thought best not to raise at this time
                                formally with His Majesty subject paragraph <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                                in reference telegram.</p>
                            <p>I gathered from Fuad he does not consider for various reasons
                                including question Palestine, recent rejection Anglo-Iraq treaty and
                                King’s rejection similar Anglo-Saudi treaty present moment opportune
                                one discuss Dhahran air base.</p>
                            <p>After Fuad talked with King he said we need have no concern
                                whatsoever that these and other facilities would be granted US
                                freely by <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> in case of any
                                “emergency”. In response to my questions he said further <gloss
                                    target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> might be prepared at an early date
                                discuss nature of this and other aid <gloss target="#t_SAG1"
                                    >SAG</gloss> would be prepared to offer US in case of an
                                emergency or imminent threat of one. When I pointed out some
                                decision would have to be reached before March 1949 regarding
                                operation air base he assured me this question could be dealt with
                                in due time. He admitted <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> would
                                not be able operate air base alone and would need guidance. He gave
                                me as strong assurances as I believe he could under circumstances
                                that if we had faith in <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> and
                                showed our confidence some formula could be found satisfactory to us
                                both.</p>
                            <p>Fuad said after my first audience with His Majesty, King had
                                developed further idea in private talk with him on a tripartite
                                agreement under UN between US, Great Britain and Arab states
                                possibly through Arab League which would attain same security
                                objectives British had sought in their proposed bilateral treaty
                                with Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Such an arrangement would ease
                                the problem of those Arab states in making individual arrangements
                                and would facilitate objectives we all sought. He did not have any
                                precise ideas as to form but thought we should be giving thought to
                                it.</p>
                            <p>Fuad said he agreeable to visit high ranking air force officer adding
                                King desired I be present at this and all other visits official
                                Americans Riyadh. He also said he thought we could work out together
                                formula for assignment Colonel Seeds Legation.<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d172fn2">On the evening of February 20, Fuad Bey brought
                                    to Minister Childs a private memorandum, with whose content the
                                    King was said to be acquainted, which stated in effect that “we

                                    military aid Saudi Arabia settled satisfactorily. Fuad
                                    emphasized we should not separate parts of a whole.” (telegram

                                    <item>King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia has recently been under very
                                        great pressure from other Arab States, particularly Iraq and
                                        Transjordan, to cancel the American oil concession in his
                                        country, a concession from which the United States Navy is
                                        now drawing approximately 40 percent of its oil and from
                                        which it is expected that to a considerable extent the
                                        Marshall Plan will be oiled. King Ibn Saud has so far
                                        resisted this pressure. He is, however, now asking for
                                        certain assistance from the United States and for evidence
                                        of United States Government interest in Saudi Arabia.
                                        Rehabilitation of the rundown installations at Dhahran would
                                        be a concrete instance of United States Government interest
                                        in Saudi Arabia and one which would be helpful at this time
                                        in our negotiations with him.</item>

                                    <item>The Government of Great Britain is endeavoring to work out
                                        an agreement with the Government of Saudi Arabia in regard
                                        to the maintenance and use of the strategic installations in
                                        Saudi Arabia, Although the United States welcomes British
                                        moves to stiffen the defenses of the Near East,
                                        nevertheless, the British proposal to King Ibn Saud will
                                        prove embarrassing to this government, unless we are in a
                                        position to show our own interest in the strategic
                                        facilities of Saudi Arabia. The Dhahran Airbase is the most
                                        important “strategic facility” in the area, and its
                                        rehabilitation along the lines mentioned above would be very
                                        helpful in strengthening our position in a country whose oil

                                    of January 16 to Mr. Henderson, Mr. Merriam stated that “Ten

                                    Arabia beginning in August 1946. This money was used for such
                                    items as cereals, sugar, textiles, automotive equipment,
                                    agricultural equipment and hospital supplies”. Mr. Merriam
                                    concluded his memorandum with the following observations: “(<hi
                                        rend="italic">a</hi>) For many years foreign governments and
                                    private firms have been making money available to King Ibn Saud
                                    to cover his ever increasing deficits. Unless this practice is
                                    checked it will go on until a financial crisis is induced in
                                    Saudi Arabia of a magnitude far greater than the present serious
                                    but limited emergency. <p>“(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) In view of
                                        King Ibn Saud’s ever growing income there is no reason why
                                        he cannot put his financial house in order and obtain loans
                                        on their economic merits and not on the basis of
                                        politics.</p>
                                    <p>“(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) The Department would be happy to
                                        see the Export Import Bank ask the Government of Saudi
                                        Arabia to produce a budget and other data such as is
                                        demanded of governments requesting loans from banks.</p>
                                    <p>“(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) If sufficiently accurate data of
                                        this sort can be obtained and if the bank feels that on the
                                        basis of this information, this would be a sound loan, the
                                        Department would have no political objection to the loan
                                        unless in the meantime new political factors bearing on the
                                        matter should supervene.” (890F.51/1–1648). A marginal
                                        notation by Mr. Henderson gave his approval of the

                                said that the $15,00,000 was needed for development projects in his
                                country, such as public utilities, airport expansion, etc. and that
                                the $5,000,000 was to cover purchases which have already been made
                                by the Government of Saudi Arabia in this country. Although some of
                                these purchases were electrical equipment, they were mostly made up
                                of grains, other foodstuffs and various non capital items, such as
                                trucks and textiles.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Merriam told the Minister that his request would be given earnest
                                consideration. Although it was probable that the Minister’s request
                                for a $15,000,000 loan for development projects would meet with
                                favorable consideration, Mr. Merriam said that in his opinion the
                                Export-Import Bank was not now in a position to finance current
                                noncapital imports such as foodstuffs.</p>
                            <p>It was agreed that Sheikh Asad al-Faqih would make a formal
                                presentation of this request to the Export-Import Bank; and that the
                                Department would have explanatory conversations regarding these
                                matters with the Export-Import Bank.</p>

                                to me of multilateral pact embracing US, Great Britain and perhaps

                            <p>When Azzam Pasha, Secretary General Arab League, visited Jidda last
                                month we discussed subject at some length and Azzam expressed
                                himself to me as heartily in favor such multilateral mutual defense

                                to me very useful purpose such pact would serve relieving countries
                                such as Iraq and Egypt from criticism which might be made by
                                extremist elements those countries of subservience sovereign

                                He thought if such strategic facilities granted under multilateral
                                arrangements to US and Britain, this criticism would disappear. (See

                            <p>My Syrian colleague has expressed himself to me recently as very much
                                in favor such arrangement and it is believed by me quite certain in
                                view foregoing it would be particularly welcomed by Saudi Arabia. If
                                multilateral pact were not considered feasible comprising US,
                                Britain, Arab States and perhaps subsequently France, consideration
                                might be given bilateral pacts as suggested in Arab League

                            <p>It is recognized there are certain obvious disadvantages to inclusion
                                even eventually France in such pact in view low esteem in which
                                France held by Arab States. At same time it occurs to me association
                                France would have very helpful psychological value in France itself
                                in attaching that country more closely to US and Great Britain and
                                propaganda value such inclusion could perhaps be made convincing at

                            <p>King Ibn Saud, Lebanese, Syrian and Iraqi leaders, and Azzam Pasha
                                (Secretary-General of the Arab League) have indicated to our
                                representatives that they feel the nationalistic leaders in the Arab
                                world have got themselves into a box. The latter will not sign
                                treaties of alliance with the British on terms which will permit the
                                British to carry out their end of the obligation. Therefore, the
                                broader-gauged Arab leaders consider that the Arab countries might
                                enter into a treaty or some kind of arrangement with Great Britain
                                as a group, thus accomplishing together what domestic politics do
                                not allow them to accomplish singly. The possibility of making a
                                group arrangement with the United States as well as with Great
                                Britain is also being considered by the Arabs. There is no doubt
                                that they fear that an alliance between the Arab countries and Great
                                Britain might well, in view of present British weakness, be more of
                                a liability than an asset unless the United States was associated
                                with it in some way.</p>
                            <p>For their part, the British consider that an Arab League-Great
                                Britain arrangement (with the United States added if we are
                                agreeable) might possibly solve the present impasse. However, they,
                                do not want a vague alliance which will commit Great Britain to the
                                defense of the Arab Near East unless facilities are granted enabling
                                them to carry out their commitment. The British will shortly point
                                this out to Ibn Saud and to the Lebanese. The working-level view in
                                the Foreign Office is, that the best plan would be an Arab League
                                resolution forming an umbrella under which the British could go
                                ahead with their bilateral treaties. (This transparent device would
                                probably not appeal to the Arabs.)</p>
                            <p>It is, of course, clear that the United States should not give any
                                encouragement to any idea that we would participate in an alliance
                                arrangement with the Arab Near East. On the other hand, we are
                                interested in the security of the area and should keep informed on
                                the development of Arab ideas coming in so that we can throw cold
                                water on any unrealistic plans before they become formalized, and
                                encourage any trend that coincides with our interests and
                                capabilities. The last part of the telegram is directed to this

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Attached is a copy
                                of a letter from Mr. T. E. Bromley, First Secretary of the British
                                Embassy in Washington, to Mr. Gordon P. Merriam, Chief of the
                                Division of Near Eastern Affairs, Department of State, dated March
                                24, 1948,<note n="1" xml:id="d177fn1">Not printed.</note> which it
                                is requested be referred to Major General Alfred M. Gruenther,
                                Director [Joint Staff] of Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
                            <p>You will note that in this letter Mr. Bromley states that it has been
                                decided in London that it would be better not to resume negotiations
                                with King Ibn Saud until it can be seen how the situation will
                                develop in Iraq. In the opinion of the British this period of delay
                                provides a good opportunity to decide in detail exactly what
                                strategic facilities the British and Americans require from Saudi
                                Arabia.</p>
                            <p>You will recall that the British previously approached the US Chiefs
                                of Staff, through the British Joint Services Mission in Washington,
                                and that after discussion the Joint Chiefs of Staff replied that
                                they would prefer that the document should receive prior
                                consideration by the Department of State.<hi rend="superscript"
                                    >2</hi> With this in mind the Foreign Office has now asked the
                                British Embassy in Washington to obtain the considered views of the
                                Department on this question, together with those of the US Chiefs of
                                Staff. [Here follows comment on a British, paper concerning British
                                strategic requirements in Saudi Arabia.]</p>
                            <p>Comments of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on this paper and their
                                decision as to what strategic facilities the United States will
                                require in Saudi Arabia will be appreciated. When they have come to
                                a conclusion on this matter it might be well to hold a meeting with
                                members of the Division of Near Eastern Affairs and the Joint Chiefs
                                of Staff to review and coordinate our positions before response is
                                made to the British.</p>

                            <p>125. Dept assumes Brit Minister has informed you of his definite
                                instructions from London re resumption treaty talks with King. These
                                appear to have as principal purpose to explain reasons behind nature
                                of original Brit proposal, to invite specific counter-proposal from
                                    <pb n="232" xml:id="pg_232" facs="0246"/>
                                <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>, and, while giving some
                                encouragement to Arab League as contrasted with bilateral concept,
                                to discourage development of Arab League security concept in a form
                                which Brit would consider ineffective.</p>
                            <p>In your forthcoming conversation with King Ibn Saud you are
                                authorized to say in your discretion that we believe Brit are
                                sincere in their desire to work out treaty arrangements with Arab
                                countries including SA which will contribute to security of Middle
                                East and that we continue to be hopeful that arrangements which are
                                mutually beneficial and acceptable will be consummated. HM’s idea of
                                an Arab League approach to the problem is an interesting one but
                                obviously requires careful thought and friendly consultation at all
                                stages if it is to bear fruit. There would be no gain if Arab League
                                countries were to work out a system of security which would require
                                backing if such a system would be considered impracticable by the
                                British.</p>
                            <p>You should add that you have reported to your Govt HM’s thought that
                                US might in some way participate in <gloss target="#t_ME1"
                                    >ME</gloss> defense arrangements, and that similar thought has
                                been expressed in other Arab quarters. While US Govt cannot give any
                                assurances whatever in this regard, it would be glad to be kept
                                apprised of development of ideas Arab Govts on security matters of
                                common interest to them.</p>

                                I flew there fifteenth and sixteenth returned. I saw His Majesty
                                twice and conferred at length with Shaikh Yusuf Yassin.</p>
                            <p>Shaikh Yusuf showed me a British communication which had already been
                                subject discussion between Trott and me, and I was shown translation
                                His Majesty’s reply and asked state my views. It is presumed
                                Department will obtain text from British Ambassador Washington but
                                if not available, Legation will telegraph.</p>
                            <p>I cleared up first of all serious misapprehension gained from British
                                memorandum re British desire bring about better relations <gloss

                                Transjordan on other. Shaikh Yusuf had interpreted British
                                memorandum to mean that unless <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>
                                would accept treaty similar British-Transjordan and British-Iraqi

                                    xml:id="pg_233" facs="0247"/>I informed Shaikh Yusuf I felt sure
                                it was not intention British Government insist on conclusion treaty
                                similar to rejected British-Iraqi treaty. Britain in its present
                                memorandum was merely justifying its previous offer of treaty to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> along lines Iraqian [<hi

                                for <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> than manifested for Iraq and
                                Transjordan. I pointed out to Shaikh Yusuf that what British in fact
                                had stated in memorandum was that since their previous efforts to
                                bring about better understanding had not been successful, they were
                                now inquiring of <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> for its own
                                suggestions as to how relations might be improved between <gloss
                                    target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> on one hand and Iraq and
                                Transjordan on other.</p>
                            <p>I plainly indicated to Shaikh Yusuf my disappointment with paragraph
                                6 <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>’s reply to British. This reads
                                in translation as follows:</p>
                            <p>[Here follows a translation of this paragraph, which asserted that
                                the way to help the Arabs was to provide them with “arms and
                                necessary factories”, as well as training facilities. The King
                                expressed his view that it would be futile for the British to
                                restrict their help to sending troops to occupy Arab countries,
                                which they would not accept. The ideal plan was to follow the
                                example of the aid granted to Turkey. If similar aid were extended
                                to the Arabs, they would, without formal commitment, effect the
                                necessary cooperation.</p>
                            <p>Then follows another paragraph in which Shaikh Yusuf quoted the last
                                paragraph of the reply, which in general was a summation of the
                                previous paragraph.]</p>
                            <p>In long discussion, I presented following essential points: We had

                                in first two world wars. We and British had planes and ships and
                                motorized equipment. Arab states had very little. First brunt of
                                defense would fall on those powers now in state of preparation. It
                                might take several years to bring forces of Saudi Arabia and other
                                Arab states to point where they could share burden of defense. First
                                and most important task confronting problem of defense measures was
                                providing adequate facilities to those powers capable of taking
                                immediately defensive measures. I expressed also strong hope that
                                insistence upon question of sovereignty or of freedom of territories
                                from occupation did not necessarily mean that in elaboration of any
                                plans necessary facilities for adoption defensive measures would be
                                denied. I cited fact repossessed bases in British and Portuguese
                                sovereign territories, amongst others, which did not detract <pb

                                countries, and were not considered a servitude.</p>
                            <p>I expressed strong personal hope, His Majesty would use his influence
                                with Arab League induce League pass resolution along lines indicated
                                in British memorandum. His Majesty stated he was prepared conclude
                                treaty with both US and Great Britain, and added in consideration
                                very close relations with US our treaty should contain supplementary
                                protocol providing following special circumstances incident to our
                                close relations. Shaikh Yusuf added that His Majesty would be
                                prepared use his influence along lines suggested. Shaikh Yusuf, who
                                appeared impressed by my arguments stated fundamental principles set
                                forth in last paragraph British memorandum quoted above are, of
                                course, subject to discussion and interpretation. He said “we are

                                    of May 18 to Mr. Lovett, Mr. Henderson stated that the decision
                                    to withhold military aid from Saudi Arabia “should be looked
                                    upon as representing a temporary position held by this
                                    Government. At such time as a settlement for Palestine is
                                    reached, it will then be necessary for us to know what are to be
                                    our strategic interests in Saudi Arabia, in order that our
                                    diplomacy may work to protect such interests. To that end, a
                                    study is now being made by the Department of National Defense,
                                    and the problem will shortly be discussed by the Joint Chiefs of

                                exchanges views with Thaikh Yusuf Yassin, Deputy Foreign Minister.
                                His Majesty could not have been more cordial in his welcome of us
                                and spoke with great frankness and spirit utmost friendliness his
                                defense problems about which he is deeply concerned. His Majesty
                                exhibited keen realization of threatening world situation and
                                recognized Saudi Arabia might well become one of centers of
                                operations in any world conflict. He stressed present vulnerability
                                and defenseless character in particular oil installations.</p>
                            <p>General Harper outlined at length what Department Air Force able
                                offer in way funds and training Dhahran air base.<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d182fn4">In telegram 111, April 6, 7 p. m., the
                                    Department had informed Jidda that $1,500,000 had been allocated
                                    to recondition the Dhahran Air Base (890F.7962/4–248).</note>
                                His Majesty listened most attentively and asked pointedly, “Is that
                                all?” When General Harper assented, His Majesty expressed great
                                disappointment and said he was going to speak frankly as one friend
                                to another. He then said he had requested US Government some months
                                ago for concrete military aid. With present acute situation, he
                                stated Saudi Arabian needs as consisting of four Saudi Arabian
                                groups of 20,000 men each, fully equipped and trained in mechanized
                                warfare. Implicitly we [<hi rend="italic">he?</hi>] recognized that
                                he would rely on US for any defense against a major power but
                                emphasized Saudi Arabian forces he had in mind would not only assist
                                our defense plans but would be available to him for use in
                                developing defense his borders against Hashemites whom British were
                                arming. It was stated in event attack by Russia, there was no doubt
                                in His Majesty’s mind but what we would come immediately his defense
                                but suppose, by way of example, Saudi Arabia were attacked by
                                Bahrein. We would probably be content to refer matter to UN.</p>
                            <p>King stated, “Truly and actually, I never believed US Government
                                would give me this kind of reply to my request for aid. What General
                                Harper has to offer is satisfactory for a time of civilization and
                                peace but it is not for today. There are hostilities all around us.
                                War may be with us very soon. If the Americans are to arrange to
                                give such training as offered at Dhahran, at Nejd, and elsewhere in
                                Saudi Arabia, that would not be useful in such critical
                                circumstances. I do not know of any other government except the
                                British from which I can get help. In the past, British have been my
                                friends and have given me considerable assistance but since
                                discovery of oil and granting oil concessions to Americans, British
                                have changed in their attitude. They are now supporting Hashemites.
                                Truly I am in a critical situation. British themselves will not harm
                                me but Hashemites groups will. My enemies are saying I have given
                                Saudi Arabia over to the Americans. My enemies in Islamic countries
                                spread rumors I have even permitted <pb n="237" xml:id="pg_237"
                                    facs="0251"/>Americans occupy holy places. If the Americans are
                                really my friends they must change the offer that General Harper has
                                brought. America must help me at least as the British are helping
                                the Hashemites”.</p>
                            <p>It is our thought Departments of State and Defense should draft
                                without delay informal agreement using existing Dhahran air base
                                agreement as basis in which there would be incorporated provisions
                                relating not only continuance our use Dhahran but other airport
                                facilities as well, and in which provision would be made for
                                specific military aid we may be in position furnish for defense
                                Saudi Arabia. One of striking statements made by Shaikh Yusuf was
                                “You should think of Saudi Arabia as your own territory in
                                elaborating your defense plans”. As reported previously, His Majesty
                                is averse to treating question continuance our occupancy Dhahran air
                                base apart from broad general question Saudi Arabian defense. One of
                                reasons for this and perhaps controlling one is that if we furnish
                                him specific military aid he has in mind he can then justify to Arab
                                world facilities he is prepared and entirely ready to grant to US at
                                Dhahran as well as elsewhere. Such an agreement, it is believed
                                would satisfy His Majesty’s request for mutual defense pact and
                                would have other obvious advantages.</p>
                            <p>Attitude His Majesty may best be summed up in statement “do something
                                concrete now or tell us that you are going to do nothing”. Under
                                these circumstances we suggest the various studies now being carried
                                on in Washington regarding US defense plans in Saudi Arabia be
                                pushed to a rapid conclusion. If decision these studies is negative
                                King should be so informed as quickly as possible. If on other hand
                                it is decided we will take active steps to defend the Arabian
                                Peninsula we suggest that a party of American technicians under
                                auspices Department Defense come to Saudi Arabia and confer with
                                King and his advisers, and be prepared submit cost program to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> which they would be expected to
                                bear. It is opinion His Majesty and our opinion the time for talk
                                has passed and it is imperative group which is sent to Saudi Arabia
                                should be empowered to make commitments which might be incorporated
                                in agreement referred to above.</p>
                            <p>To summarize in words Shaikh Yusuf, “if US should offer adequate
                                military aid US Government may ask what help it may need and His
                                Majesty will grant it. In fact His Majesty will not wait for you to
                                make requests. He will make the offers to you when needed”.</p>
                            <p>We are confident if problem Dhahran air base treated on foregoing
                                basis we need have no concern regarding our ability obtain
                                facilities Saudi Arabia we may desire for our own defense needs.</p>

                                        in dollars at the rate of $12 per sovereign. It was the
                                        contention of <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>,
                                        during the negotiations, that dollar payments should be
                                        calculated at the selling price of the gold sovereigns in
                                        the United States, i.e., $8.24. The Saudi Arabian
                                        negotiators insisted on payments at the rate of the
                                        sovereigns at Jidda, which fluctuated between 16 and 20
                                        dollars. The company finally presented the controversy to
                                        King Ibn Saud, after which agreement was reached at the $12
                                        level (despatch 95, April 3, from Jidda, 890F.51/4–348).

                                        sovereigns. An acute dollar shortage resulted, together with

                                Arabian Government.</p>
                            <p>Immediately upon Mr. Polkas arrival Shaikh Abdullah as-Sulaiman,
                                Minister of Finance, was informed of his presence by the Legation
                                and it was stated that Mr. Polk was at the disposition of the
                                Minister of Finance and of his advisers for any discussions which
                                they might care to have with him concerning their particular
                                problems. I have reason to believe that both the Minister of Finance
                                as well as His Majesty, were extremely gratified by the promptness
                                with which Mr. Polk made his services available and, as I had
                                anticipated, the peculiar nature of the problems confronting the
                                Saudi Arabian Government as a result of an influx of gold sovereigns
                                made the Minister of Finance peculiarly receptive to a discussion of
                                Saudi Arabian financial problems with Mr. Polk. Mr. Polk had several
                                initial conversations with: the Minister of Finance and his
                                principal assistant, <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0253"/>Shaikh
                                Mohammed Suroor, at which Second Secretary Donald C. Bergus and
                                Third Secretary T. Andrew Galambos were present. Mr. Polk requested
                                certain information of the Government to enable him to pursue his
                                inquiries, and Mr. Polk informed me that he was very much encouraged
                                by the very sincere effort made by the Government to supply him with
                                the information which he desired.</p>
                            <p>Toward the close of his visit Mr. Polk consulted with me concerning a
                                draft communication to Shaikh Mohammed Suroor embodying certain
                                personal suggestions which he felt it would be desirable to offer
                                the Saudi Arabian Government in meeting its financial problems. It
                                was both my view and Mr. Polk’s that these suggestions should be
                                made in the most informal manner and that every appearance should be
                                avoided of pressing the Saudi Arabian Government to adopt any
                                particular course of action or to employ financial experts or
                                counselors of American nationality. It was felt that the more
                                disinterested our informal advice was framed, the more likely the
                                chances of such advice being given serious consideration. Local
                                considerations regarding the need for presenting currently
                                unpalatable advice in a manner which might leave the Ministry of
                                Finance in a receptive mood for further patient exposition by their
                                own advisors of the need for future implementing measures largely
                                indicated the form in which the memorandum was cast.</p>
                            <p>I enclose a copy of the suggestions as finally framed by Mr. Polk,
                                which were communicated to Shaikh Mohammed Suroor on April 30,
                                    1948.<note n="3" xml:id="d183fn3">Not printed.</note> It will be
                                observed from the enclosed memorandum that Mr. Polk has made an
                                analysis of prospective revenues of the Saudi Arabian Government for
                                the ensuing four years, from which it appears that dollar revenues
                                alone may total in 1948 56 million dollars, in 1949 70 million
                                dollars, in 1950 100 million dollars, and in 1951 120 million
                                dollars. Mr. Polk next analyzes the present losses of the Saudi
                                Arabian Government through its currency and exchange operations and
                                he makes certain suggestions for avoiding these losses, including
                                the giving of consideration to the reduction of the silver content
                                of the riyal and the eventual introduction of a paper currency. Mr.
                                Polk also recommends the employment of carefully chosen foreign
                                experts who might prove exceedingly useful in setting up operating
                                and accounting procedures. Finally, Mr. Polk points out the
                                desirability of the employment by the Saudi Arabian Government of
                                one or more foreign consultants who might advise the Saudi Arabian
                                Government concerning its monetary problems.</p>
                            <p>On May 1, 1948, Mr. Polk, in company of Mr. Donald Bergus and Mr. T.
                                Andrew Galambos, presented his memorandum to Shaikh <pb n="240"
                                    xml:id="pg_240" facs="0254"/>Mohammed Suroor. At this conference
                                Shaikh Mohammed Suroor indicated his general agreement with the
                                points made by Mr. Polk in his memorandum but expressed
                                disappointment that it did not deal with the specific problem of
                                dollars which Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman had raised originally with
                                me. I had anticipated that this would be the first point raised by
                                the Saudi financial authorities and Mr. Polk pointed out that the
                                monetary problem arising from a decline in the premium rate on
                                sovereigns was not a genuine dollar problem of the Government. Mr.
                                Polk emphasized that Saudi Arabia’s dollar problem was not really a
                                problem of needing credit, but rather a problem of the effective and
                                wise use of the Saudi Arabian Government’s very rapidly growing
                                dollar revenues.</p>
                            <p>On May 2, 1948, Mr. Polk in company with Mr. Galambos called on
                                Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman to discuss the memorandum previously
                                presented by Mr. Polk to Shaikh Mohammed Suroor. At this conference
                                the Minister of Finance expressed a desire for Mr. Polk’s opinion on
                                how the Saudi Arabian Government could best market its sovereigns.
                                Mr. Polk replied that he was incompetent to advise him on this point
                                but expressed willingness to refer his question to the Chase
                                National Bank representative for the Middle East in Cairo.</p>
                            <p>Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman then outlined his general plans for handling
                                Saudi Arabian finances. He stated that it was the Government’s
                                purpose to establish a central bank in which the Saudi Arabian
                                Government would deposit 214 million paper riyals, an amount
                                equivalent to the recently published budgetary expenditures of the
                                Government. The Government would draw on these riyals against the
                                deposit of gold sovereigns at the rate of 65 riyals per
                                sovereign.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Polk stated that he was gratified at the direction of Shaikh
                                Abdullah’s thinking, but that he was worried over the notion of
                                stabilizing the riyal in terms of the sovereign, inasmuch as the
                                sovereign itself has a fluctuating value. Shaikh Abdullah stated
                                that he would in any event make no decision without first obtaining
                                the advice of competent experts. The Minister of Finance added that
                                the Government proposed to obtain Egyptian advisers, and Mr. Polk
                                mentioned as a suitable candidate Darwish Bey. Shaikh Abdullah asked
                                Mr. Polk if he would approach Darwish Bey to ascertain whether he
                                would be interested in the post of consultant.</p>
                            <p>In concluding the interview the Minister of Finance stated he had
                                great respect for American financial opinion and knew our advice was
                                disinterested. He reminded Mr. Polk he had first turned to the
                                “friendly American Government” when he needed advice on financial
                                problems, and he assured Mr. Polk he would again turn to the
                                “friendly American Government” for its comments on such advice as
                                the consultants whom he might employ would have to give him. I <pb

                            <p>I believe a very useful start has been made in the turning of the
                                thoughts of the Saudi Arabian Government seriously to a
                                consideration of the modernization of its currency and financial
                                problems. I wish to express my great appreciation of the extremely
                                valuable services rendered by Mr. Polk to the Legation in this
                                instance. I have expressed to Mr. Polk the hope that in the event
                                the wish should be expressed at any time by the Saudi Arabian
                                Government for his presence in Jidda for consultation he make every
                                effort to accede to such desire. I feel strongly we have an
                                exceptional opportunity presented to us at the present time and that
                                if we are prompt in taking advantage of it and prudent in our
                                approach to the Saudi Arabian authorities we may accomplish a great
                                deal in the way of assisting the Saudi Arabian Government to the
                                effective solution of its monetary and financial problems.<note
                                    n="5" xml:id="d183fn5">Mr. Polk made a second report on Saudi
                                    Arabia’s financial situation on May 31. A copy was transmitted
                                    to the Department by Jidda in despatch 160, June 5
                                    (890F.5151/6–548). The report, as quoted in the despatch, stated
                                    in part: “Saudi Arabia’s financial problem is how to convert the
                                    revenues from oil into lasting production gains. The problem is
                                    dramatic because of the size of prospective aggregate
                                    earnings—at least $2½ billion and possibly as much as $15
                                    billion. The problem is sobering because of the very real
                                    difficulties in finding promising lines of economic development
                                    in so barren a land. The problem is urgent because oil is a
                                    depletable resource—its benefits will accrue for perhaps 25 to
                                    50 years. As far as it is now known, there is nothing to take
                                    oil’s place once it is gone. So the problem may be more
                                    definitely stated as how to translate $2½–$15 billion into as
                                    big a gain in production as possible, and to do so within a
                                    generation or two.”</note>

                                    >b</hi>) if we permit credit to expire without extension this
                                would be considered further evidence of unfriendliness on our

                            <p>3. Eximbank naturally reluctant to grant extension without request
                                from borrower. Strong pressure from Dept might overcome this <pb

                                assurance on this point nor do we believe at present Dept should
                                exert such pressure.</p>
                            <p>4. If <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> requests extension before
                                July 14 Dept believes chances very good that Board will act
                                favorably.</p>
                            <p>5. Even without extension Bank would consider loan applications for
                                specific projects on their merits. Thus, no substantive loss to
                                    <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> through expiration except
                                remote possibility Bank funds will approach exhaustion.
                                Nevertheless, Dept believes expiration without adequate explanation
                                in advance to <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> would
                                unnecessarily strain relations between US and <gloss

                                Riyadh. He referred to inquiry made by Department of Saudi Arabian
                                Government Legation Washington whether Saudi Arabian Government
                                intended take up balance 15,000,000 loan from Exim Bank. Finance
                                Minister stated question had been considered by His Majesty two days
                                ago and it has been decided that no part of remaining loan available
                                would be taken up. He added “decision had been reached in view of
                                attitude taken at this time by US Government”. No specific reference
                                was made to Palestine but meaning was obvious. Finance Minister said
                                he had been instructed by King to acquaint me with foregoing.<note

                            <p>In accordance with the memorandum from your office dated 14 April
                                1948, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the letter attached
                                thereto from the Acting Secretary of State dated 13 April 1948.…</p>
                            <p>In the formulation of the statement of views requested by the Acting
                                Secretary of State concerning the strategic facilities required by
                                the United States in Saudi Arabia, the Joint Chiefs of Staff found
                                it necessary to appraise the position and security interests of the
                                United States not only with respect to Saudi Arabia but of the
                                entire area of the Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean.</p>
                            <p>Because of the changing and critical world conditions, criteria for
                                assessing strategic facilities requirements are difficult to
                                formulate in other than general terms. A summary of the criteria is
                                as follows: <list>

                            <p>1. Question extension agreement discussed with Lt. Col. Rhea
                                representing Col. O’Keefe and Col. Snyder last week in Jidda. We are
                                in agreement that it would be most impolitic raise question with
                                    <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> now. I am strongly of
                                opinion we should wait until last possible moment in hope future
                                developments may make <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> more
                                receptive to extension and may even induce it to take initiative in
                                raising question with us. <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> has
                                already intimated to me that we may have extension provided we are
                                ready to treat airport as part of larger defense strategy this
                                country and are prepared to give <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>
                                assistance in equipping and training its forces. I presume that
                                under present situation in Middle East we are not in a position to
                                make any commitments in this regard at this time. This being the
                                case, we would risk either an outright rejection of our request for
                                an extension to be made at this time or would have to face a request
                                from <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss> for military assistance
                                which we would have to reject. In my opinion, we should not consider
                                raising question extension with <gloss target="#t_SAG1">SAG</gloss>
                                before early 1949 unless in meantime situation had so radically
                                changed to make it appear time and circumstances more propitious
                                than those at present.<note n="1" xml:id="d189fn1">The Department

                                        either the British or the United States Government, the

                            <p>There is no assurance that recommendations that might be made by a
                                U.S. technical mission within the framework of U.S. monetary policy
                                would be acceptable to the Saudi Arab Government, or if acceptable
                                would be effectively implemented by that Government. The Saudi Arab
                                Government has at best only a vague notion of the requirements of
                                modern monetary policy but undoubtedly is seriously determined to
                                take maximum advantage of its present gold position which is
                                supported by the payment of oil royalties in British gold
                                sovereigns. Although the British gold sovereign is worth only $8.24
                                at the official U.S. Treasury price for gold, Saudi Arabia has been
                                disposing of its current accruals of gold sovereigns through the
                                Banque de L’Indo-Chine at $12–14 per sovereign. Recent efforts to
                                maintain this advantage have involved the establishment of
                                unrealistic exchange rates between the Saudi Arab silver riyal, the
                                U.S. dollar, and the gold sovereign.</p>
                            <p>The United States’ economic and strategic interests in Saudi Arabia
                                are considerable. While <gloss target="#t_Aramco1">Aramco</gloss>
                                has been somewhat disadvantaged by the recent monetary decrees in

                                representatives, lies in the progressive development on the part of
                                the Saudi Arab Government of an intelligent understanding of its
                                monetary requirements and problems and of a gradual reform of its
                                complicated monetary arrangements in the direction of a single
                                national currency with a fixed foreign exchange rate in terms of
                                gold and the U.S. dollar and with adequate controls over the
                                internal supply of money and the disposition of foreign exchange

                                not prepared to act or could not act promptly enough. It is evident
                                from discussions between officers of the Department and
                                representatives of the oil company that in fact the <pb n="250"

                                arisen, however, I am suggesting the following alternative which has

                            <p>Mr. Eddy should go to Saudi Arabia for a period of two to three

                                purpose of having informal discussions with Saudi Arab officials
                                concerning their monetary and financial problems. Mr. Eddy should
                                probably be accompanied by one or more representatives of other
                                agencies including a representative of the State Department (<gloss
                                    target="#t_OFD1">OFD</gloss>). Such representatives, it would be
                                clearly understood, would be in a position if the opportunity arose,
                                to give such technical advice and to make such recommendations
                                concerning Saudi Arabia’s monetary problems as, in the light of
                                their previous study, experience and technical competence seem
                                appropriate to them, possibly on an <hi rend="italic">ad

                                participate in any discussions or negotiations between the oil
                                company and the Saudi Arab Government. It would be made plain to the
                                Saudi Arab Government that the United States Government would have
                                no responsibility for the success or failure of any policies adopted
                                by the Saudi Arab Government on the basis of such recommendations

                            <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a result of still further studies, have
                                come to additional conclusions as to action which should be taken in
                                Saudi Arabia to improve the strategic position of the United States.
                                Their views as expressed to me are as follows: <quote
                                    rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“The Joint Chiefs of Staff have recently completed an
                                        analysis of the strategic requirements of the United States
                                        in Saudi Arabia, which was forwarded to you on 10 August
                                        1948. In elaboration of this analysis, they desire to
                                        express the opinion that our world-wide strategic position
                                        would be greatly improved if, in the event of war, the means
                                        could be developed to defend successfully, and to conduct
                                        sustained air operations from Dhahran Air Base. An initial
                                        step in achieving this ultimate objective would be to
                                        introduce into the area at the earliest feasible moment
                                        additional U.S. military personnel. It is believed that this
                                        initial increase in personnel could be effected by expanding
                                        the Air Force Training Mission now stationed at Dhahran Air
                                        Base through the addition of Army and Navy contingents.</p>
                                    <p>“The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider it highly desirable that
                                        the Secretary of State be advised of their views and aims in
                                        this respect and of their conviction that an approach should
                                        be made to the Saudi Arabian Government at the earliest
                                        possible moment consistent with diplomatic considerations in
                                        order to obtain its consent to such an expansion of the Air
                                        Force Training Mission. At such time, they would be most
                                        willing to provide representation if the Department of State
                                        so desires, to participate in any planning which may be
                                        necessary to determine the exact details of the diplomatic
                                        approach to be adopted in order to secure a favorable
                                        reaction on the part of the Saudi Arabian Government.</p>
                                    <p>“In order to effect this contemplated expansion, it will be
                                        necessary for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the appropriate
                                        time to make provision in the Military Establishment budget
                                        for the necessary supporting funds. They would therefore
                                        appreciate being informed at such time as it appears to the
                                        Secretary of State that diplomatic negotiations with the
                                        Saudi Arabian Government concerning this expansion can be
                                        undertaken.”</p>

                                later repeated by me in writing. King said words not enough, wanted
                                deeds. I replied (1) our cooperation Dhahran airbase would be
                                helpful both sides as beginning longer term military collaboration
                                two governments and (2) speaking personally and without attempt

                                <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Your letter of
                                November 8th has been received setting forth further conclusions of
                                the Joint Chiefs of Staff as to action which should be taken in
                                Saudi Arabia to improve the strategic position of the United States.
                                I note with interest their opinion that our world-wide strategic
                                position would be greatly improved if the means could be developed
                                to defend successfully, and to conduct sustained air operations from
                                Dhahran Air Base, and that an initial step in achieving this
                                ultimate objective would be to introduce into the area at the
                                earliest feasible moment additional U.S. military personnel,
                                possibly by expanding the Air Force Training Mission. Also, that the
                                Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that an approach should be made to
                                the Saudi Arabian Government at the earliest possible moment
                                consistent with diplomatic considerations in order to obtain its
                                consent to such an expansion of the Air Force Training Mission.</p>
                            <p>As you are aware, the agreement between this Government and the Saudi
                                Arabian Government covering our rights at the Dhahran Airport
                                expires on March 15, 1949. The Department of State now plans to
                                bring up the question of extending this agreement the latter part of
                                November or early in December.</p>
                            <p>It is the desire of this Department to have our Minister to Saudi
                                Arabia, Mr. J. Rives Childs, who will conduct the negotiations with
                                King Ibn Saud, as fully informed as possible regarding this problem.
                                Thanks to your letters to me dated August 16th<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d196fn1">Not printed, but see footnote 1, <ref
                                        target="#pg_244">p. 244</ref>.</note> and November 8th of
                                this year, it is possible to inform Minister Childs of the position
                                of the National Military Establishment regarding its interest in the
                                Arabian Peninsula as a whole and in the Dhahran Air Base in
                                particular.</p>
                            <p>Incidentally, I should like to point out that civil aviation rights
                                are now contained in the Air Base Agreement, as amended by an
                                exchange of notes dated December 20, 1945 and January 2, 1946,<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d196fn2">Neither printed, but for summaries, see

                                While as a general policy civil and military rights should be
                                contained in separate agreements, it may be that such a course of
                                action will not prove practical in this case. It is our intention to
                                instruct Minister Childs to remind King Ibn Saud of the continued
                                interest of the United States, first expressed in 1945, in
                                concluding a Civil Air Agreement. However, should the Government of
                                Saudi Arabia not be prepared to conclude a Civil Agreement at this
                                time it would be <pb n="256" xml:id="pg_256" facs="0270"
                                />satisfactory if the present civil air provisions of the Air Base
                                Agreement are extended for a reasonable period of time.</p>
                            <p>It may well be that King Ibn Saud will wish to bargain in regard to
                                an extension of this agreement. If this happens, the answers to
                                various questions such as the following, should be known in advance:
                                (1) Is the extension sufficiently important to justify the
                                expenditure of additional sums by the Air Force on the development
                                of this base, and if so how much might those sums be? (2) How long
                                an extension would be required in order to justify such
                                expenditures? (3) Is the National Military Establishment prepared,
                                provided the embargo against shipments of arms to the Near East is
                                lifted, to supply the Government of Saudi Arabia with arms and other
                                military equipment? King Ibn Saud has made repeated requests to this
                                Government for equipment for his Army and it is believed that he may
                                repeat his request as a bargaining weapon when we discuss air base
                                renewal with him. (4) How large an expansion of the Air Force
                                Training Mission, mentioned in your letter of November 8th, might be
                                undertaken at Dhahran? (5) Would the National Military Establishment
                                be prepared to extend the scope of the training provided Saudi
                                Arabia to include instruction in fields other than aviation?</p>
                            <p>Because the answers to these and similar questions may well require
                                time to prepare, I hope it will be possible to have the benefit of
                                your conclusions in time for them to be made available to the
                                American Minister in Saudi Arabia at the earliest practicable date.
                                As suggested in the fourth paragraph of your letter of November 8th,
                                the Department of State would welcome the immediate assignment of a
                                representative of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to participate regularly
                                in further planning on this subject.<note n="3" xml:id="d196fn3">On

                                <p>Thinking of Nat Mil Estab has not crystalized re Dhahran. US
                                    strategic planners do not at present know extent commitments
                                    they may be called upon to enforce, such as possible aid to

                                    carry out above. Dept has had almost daily talks with various
                                    Air Force and Nat Mil Establ planners but because difficulties
                                    outlined can get nothing definite on such questions as expanding
                                    facilities and personnel Dhahran Air Base, increasing training
                                    given there, and possibility eventually furnishing mil equipment

                                    these and similar questions. Therefore, Dept has reluctantly
                                    come conclusion that best course approach is to point out
                                    importance Dhahran to King and show extent assistance we are
                                    granting him by maintaining and operating air field and air
                                    base. If he should counter with certain specific requests other
                                    than general tripartite agreement, mentioned above, these will
                                    be presented Nat Mil Establ for consideration. For your info
                                    only, at present Air Force considers Dhahran important but not
                                    vital and is in no position make extensive commitments re
                                    expansion training, or providing mil equipment if such should be
                                    required for extension of Agreement.</p>

                                    accession was in dispute, received the intermittent attention of
                                    the Security Council during the spring of 1948. Security Council
                                    action was limited by the general feeling that the accession of
                                    Junagadh to India was not of sufficient importance to justify
                                    distracting the Council from the more pressing issues involving
                                    Kashmir. For summary of Indian and Pakistani statements before

                                developments in Kashmir situation. Among other things he said <gloss

                                    >Sir Alexander Cadogan, United Kingdom Permanent Representative
                                    on the United Nations Security Council.</note> had been

                                as Cadogan knows of actual filing of such an appeal by India, he is
                                to take steps to assure that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                considers matter as soon as possible (retel 6668 from London, Dec,

                                has today told us that <gloss target="#t_UKDel1">UKDel</gloss> in
                                New York has already made an informal approach to UN Secretariat on

                            <p>Allen then said his Govt was inviting attention of US to possibility
                                of taking similar steps and that Cadogan had been apprised of this
                                also.</p>
                            <p>Dept. informed Allen later in day that while US agrees Indian appeal
                                should be heard as expeditiously as possible, we believe this can be
                                accomplished by informal methods rather than by any formal approach
                                such as a letter to <gloss target="#t_SecGen1">Sec. Gen.</gloss> or
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> President. We observed further
                                that since Belgian is now <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                President, it should be possible to approach him informally and
                                accomplish the desired result with no difficulty.</p>
                            <p>Dept does not believe it desirable or wise at outset of this case to
                                make political issue of time or speed with which <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should deal with matter. We are,
                                however, willing to support informal methods of obtaining immediate
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> consideration of the case. We
                                recognize that after <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> commences
                                such consideration Pakistan may desire stay in proceedings pending
                                completion of preparation of case or arrival of additional
                                personnel. In such an eventuality we believe <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> should adhere to well-established practice of
                                permitting parties reasonable period of time to make such

                                in Kashmir entering Pakistan inadvertently. Bucher said this was
                                highly improbable since troops must stay on highways and boundary
                                was clearly defined.</p>

                            <p>Nehru assured me <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had no intention

                                would cause situation deteriorate further. I asked Nehru what he
                                thought was most dangerous factor in existing situation. He replied
                                that larger part of west Punjab was now for all practical purposes
                                “tribal territory” and that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>
                                could neither disarm nor control tribesmen. He said <gloss

                                action against <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> but that he
                                feared Kashmiri irregulars might raid into west Punjab in
                                retaliation raids into Jammu by tribesmen from west Punjab.</p>
                            <p>No written reply to Embassy note yet received but I consider Nehru’s

                                without those items Mohan Singh could do little. He said east west

                                    determination, it is probable that this will be done at the
                                    instigation or inspiration of the British delegation and will
                                    take the form of proposing a “conservatory move” (provisional
                                    measure) under Article 40 of the Charter to freeze the
                                    situation, this proposal presumably to be followed by the early
                                    establishment of a United Nation’s Commission to proceed to the
                                    area. The United States would not oppose such a procedure
                                    provided that it would lead to the general objective indicated
                                    in para one above. To this end any resolution adopted by the
                                    Security Council should recognize the existence of a dispute
                                    between India and Pakistan related to the ultimate affiliation
                                    of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and the willingness expressed
                                    by both governments to have this problem resolved by a fair
                                    determination of the will of the people of the state when
                                    conditions in the area permit. The resolution should recommend
                                    that the two Govts take all necessary action in cooperation to
                                    restore peace and order in the area, and to bring about a
                                    situation in which the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir
                                    can be freely determined. The role of a Commission would thus be
                                    that of performing good offices between the two Govts.</item>

                                <item>It is apparent from the strength of the advisory group being
                                    sent to New York from London to supplement the present UK
                                    delegation at the United Nations in connection with the Indian
                                    complaint that the British are seriously concerned over the
                                    implications of the current situation. Indications are, however,
                                    that the British delegation, because of the peculiar position
                                    which the United Kingdom occupies vis-à-vis India and Pakistan,
                                    wishes to avoid assuming the overt leadership in any program
                                    adopted by the Security Council. Nevertheless, as the most
                                    directly concerned third govt, the British will find it
                                    difficult to avoid taking the lead in the present situation.
                                    Examination of other possibilities among Security Council
                                    members would point to the United States as the virtually
                                    inevitable second choice and, as between the British and
                                    ourselves, there is clearly no doubt that from the standpoint of
                                    both background and direct concern British initiative would be
                                    indicated. The Dept therefore feels that we should approach the

                                        them to the Security Council, there is ample evidence of the
                                        efforts made by the Government of India to settle this
                                        matter by friendly negotiation with the Government of
                                        Pakistan and of the patience which they have shown in the

                                        territory. They feel that they would have been within their
                                        rights in entering Pakistan territory in order to strike at
                                        bases, situated in that territory, from which the invaders

                                        invasion and thus enabled to determine their future by their

                                        of the United States of America will help in the speedy

                                that will stop the present fighting as quickly as possible. There
                                may be elements of agreement between Pakistan and India permitting a
                                decision by the UN. Such a decision should be firm and promptly

                                troops would be the most suitable. This observation is based on the
                                conclusion that the one indispensable condition of peace in Kashmir
                                is to guarantee the security of the Moslems. The whole affair

                                reprisals by the troops he took political refuge by requesting the
                                accession of Kashmir to India. The only effective guarantee of the
                                security of Moslems in the view of the tribes would be supervision
                                by Pakistan troops.</p>

                            <p>I replied that I would not exclude the possibility of the US

                            <p>45. Dr. P. P. Pillai brought Dr. Gopalaswami Ayyangar, who will
                                present India’s case on the Kashmir question before <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, in to call on me this afternoon.</p>
                            <p>Ayyangar was very moderate in expressing his views. He alluded to the
                                “right end” India would have under international law in crossing
                                Pakistan territory as a measure of self-defense against raiders
                                penetrating Kashmir. However, <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                realized that under present state of affairs, this might precipitate
                                war with Pakistan. In an earlier day there was no international
                                organization, no <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to which matter
                                could be referred. Since we now have <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>, the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> preferred
                                to bring matter to the Council and avoid thereby, if possible, risk
                                of conflict with Pakistan.</p>
                            <p>Ayyangar said that prompt action by Council was necessary. He said
                                that most important thing was to put a stop to the fighting. He <pb
                                    n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0293"/>confirmed that a plebiscite
                                or referendum might provide the ultimate solution. Because of
                                weather and other physical conditions, it would probably not be
                                possible to initiate action looking towards a plebiscite until
                                April. Thereafter, electoral rolls would have to be prepared and
                                this would take some time.</p>
                            <p>He thought that the Prince would soon establish a government with
                                Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah as Prime Minister. This government,
                                supported by local forces, would be responsible for maintaining law
                                and order during period of preparation of plebiscite; alternatively
                                Indian forces might be employed.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah was the head of a national party which cut across religious
                                lines. Only other political party in area is Moslem conference
                                organized on fanatically religious lines. Only 10 or 15 per cent of
                                people had the franchise. Under a plebiscite this would, of course,
                                be extended to cover the entire adult population. Taking account of
                                high degree of illiteracy, methods had been devised which could be
                                applied in Kashmir to guarantee effectiveness of the secret
                                ballot.</p>
                            <p>Ayyangar was moderate in statements to effect that Pakistan nationals
                                might have joined forces with tribal raiders. In any event,
                                principal question was whether Pakistan Government was willing and
                                able to control these raiders. He implied in his statements that he
                                thought the Pakistan Government was willing. He said that the Prime
                                Minister of Pakistan had indicated to him very recently that his
                                principal difficulty was the adverse public opinion reaction in
                                Pakistan, should Pakistan forces be employed against fellow Moslems.
                                There was a good deal to be said, Ayyangar went on, for the idea of
                                an <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> order which would give the

                                    competition with UK plan but rather as something to be

                                    capabilities. Nor does Dept wish to eliminate possibility that
                                    parties may reach agreement in NY on a more complicated plan

                            <p>On the first point, Sir Zafrullah claims that the security of Kashmir
                                and Jammu ought to be guaranteed by an agreement that all armed
                                forces withdraw from Kashmir and Jammu. This includes Indian forces.
                                This is subject, however, to a proviso that enough joint forces of
                                both India and Pakistan be permitted to garrison Kashmir and Jammu
                                to insure the withdrawal of the tribesmen, and to maintain peace and
                                order.</p>
                            <p>Pakistan claims that if the principles should be agreed upon now for
                                the political settlement, the tribesmen would accept the assurance
                                of India and Pakistan that it is safe for them to withdraw, and that
                                an impartial interim government would provide a fair and uncoerced
                                method of holding a plebiscite to permanently decide such questions
                                as the accession to either India or Pakistan, and the form of
                                government that would give relative liberty to the population of
                                Kashmir and Jammu.</p>
                            <p>Other areas are involved in the political issue. Pakistan claims they
                                should be considered also.<note n="1" xml:id="d221fn1">On January
                                    15, Zafrullah Khan submitted to the Security Council three

                                    resulted in a decision at the 231st meeting of the Council on
                                    January 22 to change the agenda designation of the dispute from

                                and 10:00 p. m. this evening at the urgent request of Minister Aziz
                                upon his return to this country under instructions from his
                                government. Mr. Aziz stated that his government had noted the terms
                                of reference of the UN-Kashmir commission, which included
                                consideration of issues between the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                                government to serve notice to the Security Council as follows: If,
                                in the course of Kashmir discussions, any question involving the
                                future status of the tribal areas should emerge, Afghanistan must be
                                represented and participate therein from the outset on a basis

                            <p>In answer to a question by Mr. Henderson, Mr. Aziz stated that he
                                intended to bring this Afghan position to the attention of the
                                Security Council in the immediate future. Mr. Henderson stated the
                                interest of the United States in a permanent and equitable solution,
                                as to issues between the two countries, which would not jeopardize
                                peace and which would promote stability in the area. Minister Aziz
                                indicated he was aware that the peace of the area and the stability
                                of Pakistan might be involved in any position taken by Afghanistan,
                                but that principles involved in relations between Afghanistan and
                                related peoples to the eastward did not allow Afghanistan to remain
                                silent at this point. Since the Afghan stand might involve a serious
                                train of developments, Mr. Henderson cautioned Minister Aziz that
                                his historical and legal grounds for injecting Afghan interests into
                                the question should be carefully prepared. Aziz indicated he would
                                not wait to prepare a case but would state the position as soon as
                                possible, and support it in due course.</p>
                            <p>The major portion of the interview followed the general lines of
                                Public Works Minister Ludin’s exposition of Afghan views as set
                                forth in previous memoranda on this subject. Of his general remarks,
                                the following are of principal interest: (1) Seemingly, Ludin’s
                                observations were based upon a briefing and instructions from Aziz.
                                (2) Anti-Pakistan feelings on the part of the Afghan representatives
                                were again in evidence. (3) In addition, Aziz’s remarks indicated a
                                strongly anti-British attitude. He said that British military
                                control has not been withdrawn in the frontier area as advertised;
                                that the British in effect guide Pakistan’s policy to the northwest;
                                that British political agents, including Sir George Cunningham,<note
                                    n="2" xml:id="d225fn2">Governor of the North-West Frontier
                                    Province, 1937–1946, 1947–1948.</note> were responsible for
                                involvement of tribesmen in the Kashmir disturbances; and that
                                British money and British arms had been supplied to the tribes for
                                this purpose. (4) Afghanistan had nothing to do with this movement,
                                was not interested in the Kashmir question, nor in political issues
                                between Pakistan and India, except as they bear upon the future
                                status of the Pushtu-speaking peoples. (5) If an agreement results
                                between Pakistan and India calculated to suppress and control the
                                tribesmen according to former methods, Afghanistan will resist. (6)
                                Aziz stated his personal view that any consideration of establishing
                                diplomatic relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan must be
                                preceded by settlement of the Northwest Frontier Province question,
                                and that he, personally, was ready to abrogate the British-Afghan
                                treaty of 1921.</p>

                            <p>The interview tended to confirm our impression that the Afghans are
                                maintaining an intransigent attitude toward Pakistan in the belief
                                that they have a strong hand. Factors upon which such assurance may
                                rest include the following; (1) Ability to initiate Jihad through
                                the Northwest Frontier Province. (2) Possibility of a coalition with
                                the Abdul Ghaffar Khan<note n="3" xml:id="d225fn3">Leader of the

                                activities with possible efforts of <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> to bring about the collapse of Pakistan.</p>
                            <p>The question how Afghanistan would survive in the event of chaos in
                                Pakistan is unanswered. The implication, of which we are repeatedly
                                reminded, is that this would necessarily involve resort to
                                cooperation with USSR.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Henderson directed that a careful analysis of the situation be
                                communicated to our representatives at the United Nations at
                                once.</p>

                            <p>2. This position dictated by Dept’s belief that (1) attention of

                                raise is in essence a problem which would require separate
                                consideration, and (3) Afghanistan hopes to use this occasion to
                                “fish in troubled waters” and agitate, for creation of a separate
                                Pathanistan.</p>

                            <p>105. Following is an account of conversations this morning with
                                various individuals as indicated on the Kashmir case.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah, my first caller, initiated our conversation by giving me
                                brief account of discussions between Indian and Pakistan
                                representatives with President of Council over past few days. He
                                said these discussions had broken down because of Pakistan
                                insistence on two points which were unacceptable to India, namely,
                                the provision of an interim administration and armed forces to
                                maintain law and order. He said that he came to seek advice and
                                guidance; his whole attitude and approach being obviously to seek US
                                support for Indian viewpoint.</p>
                            <p>He said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was committed to a fair
                                and impartial plebiscite to determine whether Kashmir would go to
                                Pakistan or India and so far as he was concerned he would certainly
                                abide by the decision. He indicated he did not see that fairness and
                                impartiality would require interim administration which would set
                                aside sovereignty of the Maharajah. Kashmir was a sovereign state.
                                In acceding to India it had merely delegated to <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> powers over foreign relations,
                                defense and communications. Only question before <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> was to put end to fighting inspired
                                by Pakistan. Kashmiri Government would then be in position to carry
                                out fair and impartial plebiscite.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah was unable or unwilling to see that fairness and
                                impartiality in eyes of world would not be possible with one of
                                parties in control of administration. He was likewise unable or
                                unwilling to see that there was no question of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> imposing against sovereign will of
                                Maharajah a government on Kashmir in contrast with free exercise of
                                sovereign will of Maharajah in establishing an interim
                                administration which would command respect of entire world for its
                                fairness and impartiality.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah pressed for my ideas of what kind of interim administration
                                there might be. I made clear to him I was not advising him nor
                                expressing a US position. A possibility, however, would be a
                                balanced administration including representatives of two major
                                parties in Kashmir together with three man commission already
                                provided for. <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0306"/>In this way
                                UN would hold a balance and fairness and impartiality would be
                                assured. On other hand a UN commission charged with responsibility
                                for fair and impartial plebiscite but without any administrative
                                control could readily be a sham.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah hedged in reply to our question whether his forces were able
                                to maintain law and order in event raiders were withdrawn on one
                                side and Indian army withdrawn on other. The clear implication of
                                his remarks on this question indicated the feeling that Indian army
                                should stay, in effect that he had no other effective forces to rely
                                on.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah replied with considerable heat to a question regarding
                                possibility of Pakistan troops sharing in military administration of
                                country during plebiscite period. He said he would fight to his
                                dying breath to prevent entry of any Pakistan troops into
                                Kashmir.</p>
                            <p>It is possible that principal purpose of Abdullah’s visit was to make
                                clear to US that there is a third alternative, namely, independence.
                                He seemed overly anxious to get this point across, and made quite a
                                long and impassioned statement on subject. He said in effect that
                                whether Kashmir went to Pakistan or India the other dominion would
                                always be against solution. Kashmir would thus be a bone of
                                contention. It is a rich country. He did not want his people torn by
                                dissension between Pakistan and India. It would be much better if
                                Kashmir were independent and could seek American and British aid for
                                development of country.</p>
                            <p>I, of course, gave Abdullah no encouragement on this line and I am
                                confident when he left he understood very well where we stand on
                                this whole matter.</p>
                            <p>Ibrahim accompanied by Tameer came in immediately after Abdullah’s
                                departure. Ibrahim represented himself not only as head of Moslem
                                Conference Party but also as President of Free Kashmir Government.
                                He claimed authority over two-thirds of area and stated that all of
                                Moslems in state (more than three million) supported him. Abdullah
                                has no backing at present except among the non-Moslems. Territory
                                claimed by Ibrahim to be under his control includes all of northern
                                Gilgit area, the provinces on western border to and including
                                Mirapur; his capitol was at Tarrarkhad in Poonch. He claimed an army
                                of one hundred thousand.</p>
                            <p>Ibrahim’s idea of an impartial administration to prepare for and
                                supervise a plebiscite would be one in which neither India nor
                                Pakistan, Moslems or non-Moslems, would participate. On other hand,
                                he had considered possibility of a joint administration with a
                                neutral as Prime Minister. His concept of a neutral would be
                                possibly a Swiss, possibly an American, certainly not any
                                representative of a “colonial” power. He emphasized Indian
                                reluctance to agree to an impartial administration and withdrawal of
                                Indian <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0307"/>army was based on a
                                certainty that if these two objectives were accomplished the
                                plebiscite would unquestionably be in favor of accession to
                                Pakistan. Personally he is in favor of accession to Pakistan;
                                however, in unlikely event that plebiscite should go other way he
                                would accept verdict.</p>
                            <p>Ibrahim seemed wholly disposed, in contrast with Abdullah’s attitude,
                                to submit wholly to any decision by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss>.</p>
                            <p>In course of our conversation and in response to our question Ibrahim
                                emphatically said Kashmir could not remain independent; it could not
                                stand on its own feet. This led him and Tameer to considerable
                                discussion of fact that Kashmir in north borders on Russia through
                                caravan routes in a “no-man’s land” at extreme eastern end of Afghan
                                boundary. Sadig, Abdullah’s deputy, is a Communist. Abdullah, they
                                implied strongly, is next door to one.</p>
                            <p>Zafrullah Khan followed Ibrahim. He gave us report on consultations
                                with President of Council, bringing out clearly two fundamental
                                points of difference, namely, Indian objection to combined Pakistan
                                and Indian forces and Indian objection to interim impartial
                                administration.</p>
                            <p>He had pointed out in consultations that no impairment of Maharajah’s
                                sovereignty was involved. In first place interim administration
                                would be temporary and for a specific purpose. In second place the
                                Indian objection to neutral outsider as Prime Minister did not hold
                                water since present Prime Minister is an outsider. Ayyangar himself
                                who was Prime Minister of Kashmir for some eight or nine years was
                                an outsider and there have been other illustrations.</p>
                            <p>I asked Zafrullah if there were neither Pakistan nor Indian forces in
                                the country whether the Moslem forces claimed by Ibrahim would be
                                able to police the country. He replied quite honestly that this
                                would not do because it would not give security to non-Moslems in
                                country.</p>
                            <p>Zafrullah said he saw no signs of Indians moving from their first
                                position. Pakistan on other hand is between two fires, their
                                northern border on one side and India on other. Therefore they
                                urgently desire a settlement. They are prepared to request <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to recommend terms of settlement. In
                                response to our question he said he thought there was still room for
                                further consultations with objective of seeing if both parties would
                                not request Council to recommend terms. As in case of Ibrahim and in
                                contrast with Indian position, Zafrullah seemed disposed to go very
                                much further in accepting UN jurisdiction. Before leaving he said
                                our conversation had confirmed him in his intention at <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> meeting this afternoon to press in
                                this direction.</p>
                            <p>Noel-Baker followed Zafrullah and stated his feeling Indians now
                                taking even more stubborn position perhaps as bargaining device. He
                                cited various statements of Nehru both public and in confidential

                                were necessarily restricted unless, one, both parties requested

                            <p>117. I have had two talks with Bajpai in past two days and he in turn
                                has talked to Nehru. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> (Government
                                of India) is very anxious for settlement Kashmir matter and very
                                anxious to do what our government feels they should do in the
                                circumstances. In my first talk with Bajpai I told him very frankly
                                there was a feeling in Washington and at Lake Success that <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was most anxious to hold to Kashmir
                                and that the plebiscite offer was eyewash to justify their making
                                the accession to India stick because they know how difficult a
                                proper plebiscite will be and how strong the presumptions are in
                                favor of a verdict for the government controlling the country at the
                                time of the plebiscite. Bajpai communicated this to Nehru and Nehru
                                replied that personally he was most anxious to keep Kashmir in the
                                Indian union but on the other hand he was equally desirous that the
                                will of the people determine the matter, and that he wished to have
                                an honest plebiscite to ascertain people’s desires.</p>
                            <p>In my second talk with Bajpai we discussed the analogy between
                                Kashmir situation and that of Greece. Two situations are not
                                completely comparable, but there are elements in both which make it
                                possible to approach Kashmir question with the Greek experience in
                                mind. In Greece we dealt with interim governments or what were
                                called service governments. It seems to me that the present
                                emergency or interim government of Abdullah is in same category of
                                service governments in Greece. His government represents Kashmir
                                National Conference, the largest and most important political
                                organization in Kashmir and <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                naturally queries what the alternative would be in <pb n="296"
                                    xml:id="pg_296" facs="0310"/>terms of an interim government or
                                how it would be set up if Abdullah and his government are to be
                                displaced. It seems to me it would be hardly practicable for a UN
                                commission to set up a service government in Kashmir. Service
                                governments in Greece were set up by the Regent who derived his
                                power from the King. Abdullah acquires his power from the Maharaja
                                who is the only one able to exercise such power as well as to
                                exercise the power of determining accession under present
                                circumstances. If plebiscite can be conducted in a manner to give
                                assurances of fairness to Pakistan, question of the service
                                government becomes of lesser importance.</p>

                                and property there so that those who have fled Kashmir can return
                                and participate in establishment of parliamentary government. I
                                believe interim government should promptly take necessary steps for
                                a parliamentary election, once the matter of law and order in
                                Kashmir is established. Setting up of machinery for a parliamentary
                                election would take some months but should not be too difficult a
                                task since Kashmir has not in the past ever had a popular election
                                and there would not be the problems that we faced in Greece where
                                comprehensive election machinery was already fairly definitely set
                                up. Machinery for the election in Kashmir could be simplified and
                                still be effective.</p>
                            <p>UN commission should scrupulously observe and study the methods and
                                machinery for the parliamentary election and report to the council
                                whether they believe the election was fair and represented the will
                                of the people. Their observation of the methods, etc., would be a
                                definite check on any disposition of the interim government to do
                                other than carry out a fair ballot. If report of the commission to
                                the council is satisfactory, a plebiscite could then be held with
                                the commission again observing. They would again report to council
                                whether they believed plebiscite was fair and representative of the
                                will of the people. It seems to me that if some such plan as this
                                were carried out, natural suspicions of having one of the parties at
                                interest conduct the election would be allayed as the UN commission
                                would be final determinant of legitimacy of the balloting.</p>
                            <p>Strength of our position in Greece was that the service government in
                                power at the time was most anxious for favorable verdict from the
                                allied observing mission. I think this can be the case in Kashmir.
                                Bajpai has since discussed with Nehru these points which I outlined
                                to him purely in a personal and tentative way and Nehru has
                                approved. Indian delegate at Lake Success will doubtless be
                                instructed attempt solution Kashmir problem along these lines.
                                Department is in no way committed to these suggestions if it sees

                                (Langenhove) had met with the Indian and Pakistani delegations and

                            <p>Mr. Noyes stated that Ambassador Austin and he both strongly felt
                                that the Indian request for an adjournment should be turned down,
                                and he wanted to have the Department’s concurrence on this point.
                                However, the principal need for guidance is with respect to what
                                steps the Department believes the American representatives should
                                now take in regard to future action by the Council on this case. Mr.

                            <p>Mr. Noyes said that he and Ambassador Austin were considerably
                                dismayed by the contents of telegram No. 117 of February 7 from New
                                Delhi in which Ambassador Grady, while taking at the outset a firm
                                stand on the Kashmir question, ended up by giving his support to a
                                procedure which is almost exactly like the original Indian position
                                in the Security Council. This action by Ambassador Grady might, Mr.
                                Noyes thought, be one factor in the apparent Indian refusal to
                                continue discussing the question in the Security Council. Mr. Noyes
                                hoped that our Embassy in New Delhi was getting full information
                                with respect to the proceedings at Lake Success and pointed out that
                                Ambassador Austin was rather far out in front on the question of an
                                interim question in Kashmir before and during a plebiscite, whereas
                                Ambassador Grady has taken an entirely different attack. Mr. Noyes
                                hoped that we would straighten New Delhi out in this respect.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Noyes stated that the text of the proposals put before the
                                Indians and Pakistanis this weekend as well as the text of the
                                Indian <pb n="299" xml:id="pg_299" facs="0313"/>letter, would be
                                telephoned down as soon as received. In the meantime he hoped that
                                the Department would give urgent and serious consideration to the
                                problem presented by the Indian letter and would communicate its
                                recommendations to New York today.</p>

                                adjourned consideration of the Kashmir question on February 12 to
                                allow the Indian delegation to return to New Delhi for consultation.

                                9th, the Council considered other aspects of the India-Pakistan

                                complicate peaceful solution and furthermore that UN role in

                            <p>Kashmir interim administration could be given impartial flavor either
                                by establishment of a “service government” composed of technically
                                qualified administrators, or of a coalition government composed of
                                representatives main political parties. View Abdullah’s fierce

                                not to be responsible for adoption recommendations which British
                                from wealth of their experience might consider unworkable and to
                                which they would not give their full support.</p>

                                17. I saw Bajpai yesterday and he expressed a desire which he said
                                had full concurrence of Nehru that our govt take initiative in
                                attempting to find a solution for Kashmir problem. <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> recently received a wire from
                                Attlee which irritated Nehru and Bajpai very much. It was
                                patronizing and pressed the India Govt (and undoubtedly the same
                                wire went to Pakistan) to stop being “bad boy” and to straighten out
                                Kashmir matter with Pakistan. Gordon Walker, deputy to Noel-Baker in
                                    <gloss target="#t_CRO1">CRO</gloss> (Commonwealth Relations
                                Office) arrived New Delhi yesterday en route from Ceylon. He saw
                                Nehru last night and is to see Bajpai today. Bajpai said both he and
                                Nehru would give Walker a “piece of their mind” on the general
                                attitude of <gloss target="#t_HMG1">HMG</gloss> on Kashmir
                                dispute.</p>
                            <p>Abdullah talked with me later in the day and also stressed importance
                                of <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> initiative. He expressed
                                opinion our delegation was blindly following British lead and that
                                we should independently and energetically take the leadership.</p>
                            <p>Bajpai said that he and Nehru had been giving further thought to
                                Kashmir problem since my conversations with him before leaving for
                                Ceylon and outlined new proposals. In order to have them exact, I
                                requested him to commit them to writing and quote verbatim his
                                letter to me written after our conversation: <quote

                            <p>Bajpai’s verbal statement was somewhat more “liberal” than his
                                written. For example, he said with reference to point (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) two or three members of the Muslim
                                Conference instead of one or two. He again stressed the fact that no
                                one has come forth with practical suggestions as to how and by whom
                                an interim govt could be set up if Abdullah were eliminated. In any
                                case it is clear to the Embassy that there is little possibility of
                                getting Abdullah eliminated and I am convinced that it would be
                                equally impossible to get the Indian Govt to accept the suggestion
                                in your telegram 101 of February 19 [<hi rend="italic">17</hi>] that
                                Abdullah might fit into the picture of a coalition govt other than
                                as head. The suggestion of a coalition govt in paragraph (<hi
                                    rend="italic">a</hi>) assumes that it will function with
                                Abdullah at the head.</p>
                            <p>With regard to (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) he said that suggestion of
                                Indian delegation with respect to a parliamentary election prior to
                                plebiscite was designed to give people of Kashmir opportunity to
                                “throw out” Abdullah if they wished to do so. They are not now
                                pressing the matter of a parliamentary election before the
                                plebiscite.</p>
                            <p>With regard to (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) whole machinery can be
                                worked out by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or administrator and
                                deputies which will be appointed by Govt of Jammu and Kashmir state.
                                However he said that appointment in this manner was to preserve
                                constitutional proprieties. He assured me that any administrator and
                                his assistants that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> would
                                recommend would be formally appointed by Govt of Jammu and Kashmir.
                                I asked him if report to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> on
                                plebiscite which would be made by administrator would receive
                                whole-hearted support of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> if
                                plebiscite went against India. He replied very emphatically that it
                                would because <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> is committed to
                                accept verdict of people based on plebiscite.</p>

                                talk with Sheikh Abdullah yesterday evening re Kashmir problem
                                during which he made several observations of significance.</p>
                            <p>First he said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would never accept
                                suggestion <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> forces replace

                                India or Pakistan there would be large minority—he said 40 to 45
                                percent—in opposition majority view. Consequently he offers as
                                suggested solution Kashmir problem that state be independent so far
                                as internal affairs concerned and that defense, foreign affairs and

                                north. When asked if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would agree
                                such a proposal Abdullah replied he did not know but felt it would
                                accept provided US Government took lead in presenting suggestion. He
                                said he would be glad furnish any elucidation this proposal should

                            <p>107. Sheik Abdullah’s estimate of opposition in event accession
                                Kashmir to Pakistan far exceeds any figures we have heard here. His
                                proposal re joint defense <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> against aggression from north
                                sounds attractive (Delhi’s 150, February 21 to Department) but in
                                view unwillingness <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> accept <gloss

                                period, it seems questionable whether atmosphere is such two
                                Dominions could later agree on joint defense or effectively
                                implement it. In any case, it seems to us undesirable for US take
                                lead in presenting any such proposal at this time.</p>

                            <p>It was agreed at the outset that we should begin the discussion by
                                further exchange of views with respect to the use of Pakistan troops
                                during interim period. The US representatives pointed out that they
                                were disturbed by the possibly far-reaching implications of a
                                Security Council resolution recommending the use of foreign troops
                                from one <pb n="307" xml:id="pg_307" facs="0321"/>party to a dispute
                                in the territory of another party to the dispute. Reference was made
                                to possible analogous situations in Turkey, Iran, Greece, and China.
                                The British representatives at first attempted to minimize such an
                                analogy by asserting that Kashmir was “territory in dispute.” The US
                                representatives agreed that Kashmir was a state about which a
                                dispute had arisen between India and Pakistan but stated that they
                                found it difficult to deny the legal validity of Kashmir’s accession
                                to India. In the end, the British representatives agreed with the US
                                point of view that we had to proceed on the assumption for the time
                                being at any rate India had legal jurisdiction over Kashmir.</p>
                            <p>When it was pointed out that a second objection to a <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> recommendation that Pakistan troops
                                be used in Kashmir was that it was extremely doubtful that India
                                would permit the implementation of such a recommendation, the
                                British hastened to state that, of course, they had assumed that
                                India would in the last analysis agree to the use of Pakistan troops
                                but only if “morally compelled” to do so by virtue of a UN
                                recommendation. The US representatives said that they wished to make
                                it clear that they agreed with the British that the entry of
                                Pakistan troops into Kashmir would be in itself a desirable thing in
                                that it would no doubt help to bring about a better psychological
                                situation both for the withdrawal of the tribesmen and for the
                                holding of an impartial plebiscite. We felt, however, the furtherest
                                    [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] we could go would be to envisage
                                the use of Pakistan troops as a result of an agreement between the
                                Government of Kashmir and the Governments of India and Pakistan.
                                When the British asked what provision we had in mind for the
                                maintenance of law and order in areas where fighting had taken place
                                (and from which presumably both Indian troops and irregular forces
                                had withdrawn), we stated that it was our thought that local militia
                                could be set up in these areas on a provisional basis.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the discussion of Pakistan troop question, we referred
                                to several other features of our proposals for an interim regime in
                                Kashmir. The British appeared to be more favorably inclined to the
                                concept of a coalition government than they had previously and they
                                were particularly interested in the proposal for the placing of an
                                outsider in the Kashmir Government with jurisdiction over such
                                functions as the police, courts, etc. There was a brief but
                                inconclusive discussion with respect to the role to be played by the
                                plebiscite marshal and the plebiscite magistrate. With regard to the
                                coalition government proposal, the British seemed very reluctant to
                                agree to any scheme whereby Sheikh Abdullah would remain Prime
                                Minister even if only on a nominal basis. On the other hand, the
                                British commented that if we could get an outsider in the Kashmir
                                Government, he would hold the balance of power in any voting.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the meeting we turned over to the British several
                                copies of our draft resolution,<note n="1" xml:id="d240fn1">Not

                                transmit it immediately to London. They stated that the
                                Parliamentary Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d240fn2">C. P. Mayhew.</note> was returning from Ceylon
                                via New Delhi and Karachi and that he would be in London during the
                                early part of the first week of March with the latest information on
                                Indian and Pakistani thinking. They promised to give us the reaction
                                of their government to the US proposals by March 2nd or 3rd.</p>
                            <p>In response to an inquiry of the British we told them that we had
                                discussed with the Chinese the principles involved in our proposals
                                and that we did not contemplate further discussions with the Chinese
                                until we heard more from the British. The British seemed
                                particularly anxious to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with us
                                before discussion of detailed plans was undertaken with other
                                delegations. The British made it clear that their own proposals,
                                including those with respect to Pakistan troops, were to be
                                considered as extremely fluid and subject to revision.</p>

                                    >SC</gloss>. Nehru says privately as justification for
                                submission he felt case so strong there could be no doubt of
                                outcome. <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> feel matter a simple
                                one of invasion with the demonstrable assistance of Pakistan and
                                that <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> should only have considered
                                evidence this point and enjoined Pakistan to desist its aid to
                                tribesmen and make every effort to get them out of Kashmir. Kearney
                                feels that a defeat for Nehru before <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> might well lead to fall his government and I agree.
                                Plebiscite defeat would not have this effect. As
                                indicating-possibility Pakistan being effective in helping keep law
                                and order in Kashmir, Abdullah stated his belief tribesmen would
                                shortly be returning home for the sowing their spring crops. Once
                                they leave, problem of keeping them out, especially if Pakistan made
                                clear to them it would not continue assistance from West Punjab,
                                would be greatly simplified.</p>
                            <p>Referring your suggestions 1 to 8 inclusive, would stress the
                                importance from standpoint <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> of
                                maintaining strictly constitutional procedure. As you know, <gloss

                                grounds. I have little doubt <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> can

                                program <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> agrees to. They would
                                wish the appointment of administrator and his assistants to be
                                formally made by emergency coalition government. I am convinced
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> will continue to insist
                                Abdullah remain head of any coalition government that might be set
                                up. General feeling here is Abdullah has the confidence of people of
                                Kashmir as no other Kashmiri could possibly have. I believe if
                                authority of administrator and staffs is entirely confined to the
                                plebiscite and matters directly connected with the plebiscite and
                                the absolute authority of the emergency coalition government is
                                recognized, that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> might accept
                                your suggestions.</p>
                            <p>Drawing analogy Greek situation, I believe coalition government would
                                have every reason to wish to have favorable verdict rendered as to
                                fairness of the elections by the UN Commission and therefore be
                                meticulous in its conduct. This should be reassurance to Pakistan. I
                                believe your plan the basis upon which a solution may be worked out
                                keeping in mind the points I have made in my endeavor to appraise
                                the situation.</p>

                            <p>178. ReEmbtel 148 February 21 and 170 February 28. When Kearney
                                talked with Bajpai several days ago, Bajpai outlined to him same
                                plan as covered in his letter transmitted to you in telegram 148
                                February 21.</p>
                            <p>Kearney asked Bajpai if <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would
                                consider an alternative which would be agreement two dominions for
                                plebiscite solely on question of Kashmir independence, and second
                                plebiscite on preference accession if vote was against independence.
                                Bajpai expressed interest and said he would discuss matter with
                                Nehru. Kearney saw Nehru last night and has just talked with me.
                                Nehru said he favored plebiscite for independence based on joint
                                guarantee both dominions maintenance independence of Kashmir. Nehru
                                stated he preferred what we may call plan two (plebiscite on
                                independence) as against plan one (my telegram 148 February 21)

                                cooperation two dominions. When matter first mentioned to me by
                                Kearney, the other day, I expressed my fears of northern aggression
                                through infiltration of independent Kashmir. Nehru minimizes such
                                danger. When asked by Kearney what he thought outcome of a
                                plebiscite on independence in Kashmir would be, Nehru replied he
                                thought it would be favorable. Kearney wired today his government
                                giving comprehensive report his conversation with Nehru. Department
                                will doubtless wish to discuss this matter with Canadian

                                                India’s present legal jurisdiction over Kashmir

                                                Obvious conclusion is that only available facilities

                                In view President’s invitation to parties for them to submit
                                amendments in writing, suggest that you use friendly influence with

                                lines indicated above and also discuss with Chinese representative
                                possibility his amending his own resolution in these respects.</p>

                            <p>After a short discussion on Palestine and a few remarks regarding
                                Korea in which Bajpai noted that we had asked their Government to
                                support us on the Korean case, we got down to a discussion of the
                                Kashmir question. Ambassador Austin told them that we thought the
                                Chinese proposals with a certain number of amendments to strengthen
                                it up might form the basis of a settlement of the case, which we
                                were very anxious to see happen. He referred to the four points in
                                the telegram of March 22<note n="1" xml:id="d247fn1">Telegram 158,
                                        <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>.</note> as points in which we
                                would like to see a strengthening of the resolution. The Indians
                                agreed to point <hi rend="italic">a</hi> without any difficulty. As
                                regards item <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in respect to forces being
                                constituted locally, there were several objections. The Indians
                                raised the difficulty of anything which would give any recognition
                                to the provisional Azad Government or which would in any way give
                                authority to such a Government or its forces. Bajpai said this was
                                like asking the poacher to turn into the gamekeeper. He repeated
                                several times that <hi rend="italic">after</hi> law and order had
                                been established, the Indian forces would be perfectly agreeable to
                                withdrawing from the areas concerned and making appropriate
                                arrangements so as not to interfere with the Plebiscite. He <pb
                                    n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0329"/>stated that they were
                                making plans to reorganize the State troops and that of course they
                                would be made up, as they had been, of elements all over the State.
                                He also referred in this connection to the desirability of the
                                police in the State taking over the responsibility in local areas
                                for law and order. Ambassador Austin indicated that we had two
                                things in mind on this point: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>
                                        <hi rend="italic">First:</hi> That elements from outside the
                                        Azad area might not be welcome if they came in there and
                                        attempted to maintain law and order; and</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Second:</hi> That the Plebiscite Director
                                        should have the powers with regard to the maintenance of law
                                        and order. (Item <hi rend="italic">c</hi> in our list.)</p>
                                </quote>
                            </p>
                            <p>Not much headway was made on the first point. On the second, however,
                                many protestations were made that the Indians were quite willing
                                that the Plebiscite Administrator should have certain functions with
                                relation to law and order. They said that of course if he requested
                                the Indians to help him maintain law and order they would be very
                                glad to make their troops available to him. Ayyangar also made it
                                quite clear that they would not wish to use their troops in any way
                                which the Plebiscite Administrator felt amounted to action adversely
                                affecting the fairness of the Plebiscite. I do not recall that any
                                specific reference was made to the Plebiscite Administrator’s powers
                                over the police or the State troops. This may well have been
                                implicit in the Indian remarks.</p>
                            <p>Bajpai did, however, to my mind, water down the value of Ayyangar’s
                                remarks by referring to the fact that if the Plebiscite Director
                                needed an additional staff to <hi rend="italic">observe</hi>—in
                                addition to the eight regional directors—the Indians would of course
                                have no difficulty whatever in agreeing to his having as large a
                                staff of observers as he required. My impression was that he made a
                                clear distinction between a regular staff to run the Plebiscite and
                                to control the police, and simply observers who would report what
                                was happening.</p>
                            <p>As far as our item <hi rend="italic">d</hi> was concerned, there was
                                no difficulty. They agreed entirely.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Austin asked them about the position when they first
                                brought up this case. Ayyangar indicated that there might well have
                                been real trouble between India and Pakistan if the Security Council
                                had not been available. Ayyangar also referred in this connection to
                                the present situation, saying that the Indian Army was fighting and
                                that it was of the greatest importance that a political settlement
                                should be reached before any substantial change in the military
                                situation could take place. He intimated that the fighting could
                                result in a clinching crisis which might settle the issue.</p>

                            <p>Zafrullah Khan said he was very disturbed about the present situation
                                before the Security Council. He said that apart from the substance
                                of the Chinese amendment, he felt he had been very unfairly used in
                                the matter of procedure. On March 11 he had lunch with Tsiang who
                                had discussed generally with him the concept contained in his
                                resolution with respect to the Plebiscite Administrator. Zafrullah
                                Khan had made no substantial comments or commitments. On March 18 he
                                was again asked to see Tsiang at 12:15, to have lunch and drive out
                                with him. This was the first time he had seen the Chinese draft. The
                                placing of this draft before the Council with this background, he
                                thought, was most unfair; was a method different than followed by
                                the previous Presidents who had taken great pains to present a draft
                                to both parties at the same time and to ask for their comments in
                                front of each other. In this case he was convinced that the Indians
                                had had a great deal to do with preparing the draft. Tsiang had told
                                him that he understood the Indians would accept it except for
                                certain minor details. In spite of British protestations, he knew
                                they had been in consultation with Tsiang on the draft. Tsiang had,
                                in front of Zafrullah Khan, told Noel-Baker that one of the
                                provisions was put in at the suggestion of Noel-Baker. He was
                                concerned at the close parallel between the newspaper story which
                                appeared in India early in March and the President’s draft
                                resolution.</p>
                            <p>Zafrullah was worried about the English position. He said they had
                                changed their tone. He had had a talk with Attlee<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d248fn1">British Prime Minister Clement R.
                                    Attlee.</note> in London who had tried out on him some of the
                                ideas contained in the Chinese draft. He was personally convinced
                                that Mountbatten also had a hand in it and indicated that
                                Mountbatten was concerned that Britain by her previous stand had
                                come close to forcing India to renounce her dominion status.</p>
                            <p>Zafrullah Kahn handed Ambassador Austin a copy of a telegram from the
                                Azad Government<note n="2" xml:id="d248fn2">Telegram from the Free
                                    Kashmir Government, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note> to the
                                Security Council. (Copy attached) He said that the Chinese
                                resolution was entirely unacceptable to him as a basis of
                                discussion. He had passed it along to his Government <pb n="317"
                                    xml:id="pg_317" facs="0331"/>presumably with this comment. He
                                said if his Government felt differently about it he would not resign
                                but would carry on loyally.</p>
                            <p>He wanted to emphasize one particular aspect of the matter to us. In
                                looking at the map it was quite clear that Kashmir was essential to
                                the strategic defense of Pakistan and was of vital interest to it.
                                From many points of view, the people of Pakistan had a great

                                        fair plebiscite should be agreed upon. Under these
                                        circumstances if the plebiscite verdict went to India, the
                                        people of Pakistan and the Government would accept it and
                                        that would be the end of the issue.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> that a plebiscite should be
                                        held which the people of Pakistan could not accept as fair
                                        and that the verdict in such a plebiscite should go to
                                        India. Under these circumstances the dispute would remain
                                        and the people of Pakistan would be smarting under a feeling
                                        of having been done out of what was legitimately theirs. The
                                        situation might easily deteriorate to the point of war
                                        between the two dominions which might spread and be a danger
                                        to other States.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <hi rend="italic">Third</hi> that there was no settlement at
                                        all. In this case again the situation might deteriorate and
                                        result in fighting between the two dominions. However, if
                                        Pakistan had to choose between the latter two, Zafrullah
                                        Khan intimated that it might well choose the last course
                                        since it would have nothing to gain from a plebiscite which
                                        it considered would be a farce. He said that a Pakistan
                                        which was not satisfied and whose people were thoroughly
                                        upset about a situation as vital to them as Kashmir would
                                        constitute a serious danger to India not only in itself
                                        because Pakistan essentially was the only protection of
                                        India from the northwest—meaning the Russians. Zafrullah
                                        Khan made a strong statement of the position of Pakistan
                                        with relation to the U.S.S.R. He said that Pakistan was not
                                        sympathetic with Communism and that their position was taken
                                        in the event of any major struggle. They could not go along
                                        with the U.S.S.R. If, however, Pakistan lost a plebiscite
                                        which it considered unfair, he asked whether the Pakistan
                                        people would have any heart to fight against the U.S.S.R. If
                                        the U.S.S.R. cross through the Khyber Pass into Kashmir, the
                                        Indians would have no defense whatever unless Pakistan was
                                        with them. He said that throughout history the Moslems had
                                        not cherished luxury. They were not rich people. If a
                                        conflict arose between their honor and their desire to
                                        obtain their worldly goods, they would undoubtedly choose
                                        their honor. However, they did not wish to be driven to that
                                        choice.</p>

                            <p>Zafrullah Khan then came back to the Chinese resolution. He said that
                                the main objective was Abdullah. He pointed out that the main reason
                                for talking about safeguards was that the Chinese resolution allowed
                                Abdullah to remain and therefore placed the entire governmental
                                machinery in the hands of a very partial person. If Abdullah were
                                taken out, very few safeguards, if any, would be necessary, but <pb
                                    n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0332"/>having made this concession
                                to the Indians it was obvious to everyone that very substantial
                                safeguards would be necessary.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Austin then outlined the four points contained in the
                                draft telegram of March 22. Zafrullah Khan said again that the main
                                difficulty was Abdullah and that if he is left in his present
                                position Pakistan would not attempt to persuade the Azad Government
                                that they should enter a coalition with him. If the Azad Government
                                (which he doubted) was able to reach agreement on their own hook
                                with Abdullah on a coalition, Pakistan would not raise any
                                particular objections. Zafrullah Khan also remarked that it would be
                                esssential to keep the Indian, Army out of the situation so that it
                                could not affect the result of the plebiscite.</p>
                            <p>Zafrullah Khan said that he had received no word from his Government
                                and doubted whether he would receive any in the immediate future as
                                the Governor General was in East Pakistan and was not expected back
                                immediately. He said he had sent him the Chinese draft with the
                                request that they do not issue any wild public statements which
                                might make matters more difficult.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Austin said we were working on the case as a whole and we
                                thought we would probably be talking with Zafrullah on details
                                before taking any final position.</p>

                                <p>China’s Resolution on Kashmir as put before the Security Council
                                    is absolutely unacceptable to the Azad Kashmir Government. We
                                    have always affirmed unequivocally that we will accept any
                                    proposal which will lead to a fair plebiscite under a neutral
                                    and impartial administration but the Chinese proposal gives to
                                    India what India has failed to achieve in the battlefield. It is
                                    a preposterous idea that the Hindu Army of India is necessary
                                    for the maintenance of law and order in our country. We know the
                                    peace that the Indian Army can bring to Kashmir; it [is] the
                                    peace of the grave. We will fight to the last man to resist such
                                    a dishonourable peace the very presence of Sheikh Abdullah at

                                    soil of Kashmir will make the free exercise of vote an
                                    impossibility and any plebiscite held under such conditions will
                                    be an utter farce in the eyes of the Azad Kashmir people. It
                                    will not end war. We warn the members of the Security Council
                                    that they will defeat the very aim which they seem so anxious to
                                    achieve by coming to any agreement to which the Azad Kashmir
                                    Government is not a party. <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319"

                            <p>At the request of Dr. Tsiang, as President of the Security Council,
                                the above representatives met this morning in Tsiang’s offices to
                                discuss the Chinese draft resolution on the Kashmir question
                                introduced in the Security Council on March 18. Invitations to
                                participate in the meeting were extended to those Delegations which
                                had presented resolutions regarding the India-Pakistan question or
                                which had submitted suggestions to the President of the Council in
                                connection with his resolution. On this basis, Mr. Lopez (Colombia)
                                was invited to attend but presumably because of pique over the scant
                                attention given his resolution by the Council did not attend the
                                meeting.</p>
                            <p>The only paper was that submitted by the British which, as Sir Paul
                                explained, contained several United States suggestions. The British
                                document, in fact, incorporated the amendments on which informal
                                agreement had been reached between ourselves and the British in
                                discussions in the Department on March 20.<note n="1"
                                    xml:id="d249fn1">Memorandum of conversation not found in
                                    Department of State files.</note> Discussion on the British
                                paper was virtually restricted to the representatives of China,
                                United Kingdom, and the United States. In general, Tsiang expressed
                                his agreement with the amendments suggested but appeared to be
                                somewhat reserved with respect to British amendments dealing with
                                the distribution of Indian troops.</p>
                            <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0334"/>
                            <p>In connection with the proposed amendments expanding the powers of
                                the plebiscite administration with reference to maintenance of law
                                and order, Tsiang explained that he had discussed this question with
                                the Indian Delegation and that the latter had expressed its
                                willingness to place at the disposal of the plebiscite
                                administration both such troops and police as might be necessary for
                                any powers granted him in this category.</p>
                            <p>After completion of the discussion regarding the detailed amendments,
                                Tsiang raised the question of how he should proceed in endeavoring
                                to obtain the support of the parties to this resolution. In this
                                connection, he emphasized the importance of broadening the base of
                                support for his resolution as amended and inquired whether the
                                Delegations represented at the meeting would be willing to join him
                                in sponsoring the amended resolution. At this point, the Canadian
                                Representative said that he had been instructed to state that Canada
                                must enter a reservation regarding its position, that he could not
                                make any commitment whatsoever, and that the Canadian position had
                                always been that we should strive towards the achievement of an
                                agreement between the parties. He clearly indicated that Canada did
                                not wish to join in the sponsoring of a resolution to which one of
                                the parties was not willing to give its approval. Thereupon Nisot
                                (Belgium) stated that his position was very much like that of
                                Canada, and he entered a similar reservation. The British
                                representatives mentioned that they did not wish to participate
                                formally in the sponsorship of the resolution, and Nisot then turned
                                to the United States representatives and said that while he could
                                understand the British reluctance, he did not see why the United
                                States could not give its formal support to a resolution. He clearly
                                implied that if the United States was willing to take such a step,
                                Belgium might follow suit. Mr. Thurston said that he also would have
                                to reserve the position of his Government on the amended resolution
                                but that the possibility of United States joining like-minded
                                Delegations in a formal support of such a resolution as the one
                                under consideration was not entirely excluded.</p>
                            <p>The question of sponsorship was left unsettled, and it was agreed
                                that representatives of China, United Kingdom, and United States
                                would meet in the afternoon to work out refinements in the wording
                                of the draft resolution. The representatives of Belgium and Canada
                                stated that they would be unable to attend because of a shortage of
                                personnel. Mr. Tsiang, indicating that he would not need to have the
                                formal approval of the Governments of those representatives, stated
                                that he would undertake to discuss the resolution, as amended, with
                                the represetatives of Pakistan and India in an effort to obtain the
                                greatest possible measure of agreement. Earlier in the meeting,
                                Tsiang <pb n="321" xml:id="pg_321" facs="0335"/>had emphasized that
                                while it would probably never be possible to obtain complete
                                agreement of both parties, the effort of the Council should be
                                directed toward narrowing the area of this disagreement to the end
                                that the parties would at least acquiesce in a settlement along the
                                lines under discussion.</p>
                            <p>In a brief discussion with the British after the completion of the
                                meeting in the offices of the Chinese Delegation, it was agreed that
                                there could be no objection to the Chinese representative
                                approaching the parties with his amended resolution, and telling the
                                parties, if necessary, that his resolution, together with the
                                changes made therein had the informal approval of the United States
                                and the United Kingdom Delegations.</p>
                            <p>In the afternoon meeting, attended by representatives of China,
                                United Kingdom, and United States, proposed amendments to the
                                Chinese resolution, as contained in the attached draft,<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d249fn2">Not printed. This draft, and later amendments
                                    to it, were discussed in the week that followed in similar,
                                    semiformal meetings with a varying list of individual and
                                    country participants. Memoranda of conversations of March 25,

                                and informally agreed to. Dr. Hsu indicated that he would have to
                                discuss certain of the amendments with Tsiang, particularly those
                                relating to the disposition of troops, before he could undertake
                                Chinese sponsorship of them. Mr. Thurston stated that he entertained
                                some doubts regarding the necessity of stipulating detailed
                                provisions with respect to the disposition of Kashmir State troops
                                in view of the other safeguards on this point contained in the draft
                                resolution.</p>

                                probably be regarded as having status analogous to that of trade

                                Representative or foreign trade mission, would be obliged to use

                            <p>US policy re princely states remains unchanged, and Department will

                                protect people in certain areas of Kashmir. They are particularly
                                incensed with Pakistan because they have recently captured some
                                howitzers that could only have been brought into Kashmir over
                                bridges. On questioning Iengar as to whether what he said meant
                                intensification of military operations by Indian Army, he said “no
                                but military steps would inevitably have to take place”.</p>
                            <p>Iengar apparently desired to impress upon me that change in policy he
                                was describing should not be construed as any sort of threat or
                                ultimatum. Nevertheless it is difficult for me to interpret his
                                statement other than as warning India intends to pursue military
                                campaign in Kashmir energetically in future.</p>

                            <p>371. For <gloss target="#t_SOA1">SOA</gloss>–Thurston from Ross.
                                Referring to our phone conversation this noon, Zafrullah Kahn at his
                                request, came in to see Ambassador Austin at noon today and spent
                                about an hour with us discussing the current situation in the
                                Kashmir case. He allowed us to read two telegrams he had received
                                from Jinnah. The first long telegram he had received two or three
                                days ago on the basis of the first Chinese draft resolution. It was
                                very strongly worded and developed the following line: discussion of
                                this whole matter in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to date was
                                more than sufficient to indicate all the facts and requirements of
                                the situation. If the Council were to act on the basis of the
                                Chinese resolution, it would be performing a complete about-face.
                                This resolution was the product of a small and willful group
                                instigated by the British. Whenever a situation reached the point of
                                crisis the British abandoned Pakistan in favor of India because they
                                somehow felt that Indian support in the world was more important.
                                Pakistan could not agree to any solution of this problem that did
                                not involve the complete withdrawal of Indian troops and the
                                replacement of Abdullah.</p>
                            <p>The second very brief telegram of instructions was dated March 31
                                after the meeting of the Pakistan Cabinet on this question and was
                                received here that night. This telegram in effect repeated what the
                                longer telegram had said but in a somewhat milder language. It was
                                    <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0338"/>based on consideration
                                not only of the original Chinese draft but also of the first revised
                                    draft.<note n="1" xml:id="d252fn1">This draft, not printed, is
                                    the first of many revisions of the March 18 Chinese draft
                                    resolution.</note>
                            </p>
                            <p>Zafrullah’s attitude towards these instructions was that they of
                                course stated an extreme position and [if] he in his position here
                                at the moment, reminding us that he had quite wide latitude, was to
                                find a way of dealing with the practical political realities of the
                                situation, some formula must be found to deal with these essential
                                points.</p>
                            <p>As the situation was developing Pakistan would be obligated to
                                perform three tasks. They must make arrangements for cessation of
                                fighting, they must get the tribesmen out of Jammu-Kashmir, and they
                                must keep them out. In order to get the tribesmen out and keep them
                                out it was essential that Pakistani troops be permitted to go into
                                the Azad-Kashmir area.</p>
                            <p>The second point Zafrullah made was that any troops in Jammu and
                                Kashmir, whether Pakistani or Indian, must be under the control of
                                the Commission.</p>
                            <p>As a matter of practical politics, Pakistan could no more expect
                                their view to prevail than the Indian view. They consider that Jammu
                                and Kashmir are economically and strategically far more important to
                                Pakistan than to India. They could not expect the Indians ever to
                                agree to this principle, however, so he was trying to find ways of
                                equalizing the situation. He then went on to discuss some of the
                                specific language of the draft resolution dated March 30.<note n="2"
                                    xml:id="d252fn2">The March 30 draft was, according to a summary

                            <p>In the course of the discussion with Zafrullah, the Senator asked him
                                how much chance he thought there would be of the Indian Government
                                accepting the changes along the lines of those indicated. Zafrullah
                                replied quite frankly that he thought it might be difficult but that
                                he did not know. Before leaving, Zafrullah repeated that he would
                                send us this afternoon revised language which he also said, in
                                response to my question, he planned to present to President López
                                this afternoon. He did not think any useful purpose would be served
                                in having a Council meeting at this stage. [Ross.]</p>

                                the position in the Kashmir case. He had talked separately with each
                                of the two delegations. He had received a letter from the Indian
                                delegation containing a statement of their position together with
                                changes which they stated would be required in the March 30 Chinese
                                revised draft resolution before they could accept it.<note n="2"

                                    meeting of the Council on April 19. López informed the Council
                                    that he had received them on April 5 and 7, respectively. For

                                which he read, the Indians stated their position very flatly and
                                seemed to have withdrawn certain concessions which they previously
                                made. The delegate of Pakistan had also submitted to the President a
                                redraft of the Chinese proposal, a copy of which has been forwarded
                                to the Department.<note n="3" xml:id="d253fn3">Not found in

                                parties’ positions were further apart at this time than previously
                                and he was very pessimistic. This view was shared by several other
                                members present. The consensus of opinion was that the Indians over
                                the weekend had substantially hardened their position. They were no
                                longer talking about acquiescing in a <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                                    <item>The President stated that there was no commitment as to
                                        what action those present should take after that

                            <p>The Chinese representative stated that he would be unable under his
                                present instructions to propose the March 30 redraft of his
                                resolution by himself. It would be necessary that other delegations
                                join in sponsoring this draft resolution. No other delegations
                                offered to sponsor the resolution. I said that all the other
                                delegations present should consider this question of sponsorship and
                                should be ready at an early date to inform their colleagues whether
                                they were or were not in a position to sponsor this resolution or
                                some modification of it. The British representative, Noel-Baker,
                                said that if the parties did not agree this would place his
                                government in a peculiarly delicate position. He already had,
                                however, asked for instructions on this point.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese representative seemed to be expressing the consensus of
                                opinion when he said that the March 30 draft seems to be about
                                halfway between the positions of the two parties and that from that
                                point of view it was an excellent draft to be placed before the
                                Council as a basis for its proposed action.</p>
                            <p>There was also agreement that time was an important factor; that the
                                parties seemed to be drifting apart and with the spring weather it
                                was quite possible that they would turn to other solutions of the
                                problem. The Chinese delegate urged strongly that the Indians might
                                well give up hope very soon that they could get any solution from
                                the Council, and turn to unilateral measures. The President
                                expressed his view that time was on the side of India because she,
                                so to speak, had possession. It was unanimously agreed that some
                                decision before April 16 when the special session<note n="5"
                                    xml:id="d253fn5">Second Special Session of the United Nations
                                    General Assembly.</note> on Palestine starts was essential.
                                Noel-Baker said that if it was not done, it would be impossible to
                                hold a plebiscite before the snow falls in October.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese suggested that it would be necessary in undertaking this
                                new course for the members of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                to do some real missionary work not only with the delegations of the
                                parties here in New York but also through diplomatic channels in
                                India and Pakistan in order to persuade the two governments to
                                acquiesce in any recommendation which the Council makes. He
                                suggested that we should not finally pass a resolution in the
                                Council until we had through these channels satisfied ourselves that
                                the two parties would be likely to acquiesce in a specific
                                recommendation.</p>
                            <p>It was also agreed that the parties should not be asked at this stage
                                to come before the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> to state their
                                positions publicly as this might commit them to fixed positions.</p>
                            <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0341"/>
                            <p>In our view we must now proceed with a recommendation under Article
                                37 of the Charter. For this purpose it will be important to reach
                                agreement on the introduction of a resolution along the lines of the
                                March 30 Chinese draft. I believe it likely that if the US indicates
                                its willingness to be a co-sponsor of this draft, the British,
                                Canadians and Belgians will do so as well. This may mean some
                                difficult negotiation, particularly with the British. I therefore
                                recommend that I be authorized to be a co-sponsor of the March 30
                                draft. My intention would be to use this authority to obtain the
                                agreement of the other three, also to be co-sponsors. I have in mind
                                taking a particularly strong line with the British on the ground
                                that this is their problem and that they must face up to the
                                responsibilities involved.</p>

                                    of March 30 draft. Quite possibly they may be willing accept

                                thrown into lunatic asylum? Before he could induce Kashmiris and
                                tribesmen stop fighting, he must convince them there would be fair
                                and honest plebiscite, and that he could not do since they knew
                                meaning Chinese resolution as well as he did.</p>
                            <p>He continued, suppose Chinese resolution passed and tribesmen and

                                since he did not have such force. Suppose further he then said to
                                India “I can’t stop them. You come and do it.” Did anyone suppose
                                Indian Army was in position to take on half million tribesmen when
                                well armed and officered British had not dared attempt such feat? He
                                stressed Pakistan policy not oppressing tribesmen by force but
                                endeavoring civilize them through education, economic and social
                                development, and said he was convinced that was surest way keep them
                                quiet. Using force against them in Kashmir dispute would open
                                Pandora’s box, result of which no one could foresee.</p>

                                tribesmen and Kashmiris cease fighting. Given anything less he could
                                accomplish nothing.</p>

                            <p>225. Prime Minister asked me call today discuss Kashmir. Since I had

                                telegraphed from New York and somewhat garbled we lacked
                                authoritative text. However, Prime Minister was definite that
                                resolution was unacceptable <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss>. He
                                said it showed complete lack understanding Oriental psychology, that
                                as long as Abdullah remained in charge Kashmir Government populace
                                would not dare risk voting against him since they would consider he
                                would remain in power wreak vengeance on them. This plus presence
                                Indian troops made impartial plebiscite impossible.</p>
                            <p>I pointed out that presence new Ministers Abdullah Government
                                presence <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> commission and
                                possibility Pakistan troops being invited help maintain order
                                Kashmir gave reasonable guarantees fair vote. <pb n="336"
                                    xml:id="pg_336" facs="0350"/>He replied this might appear be
                                case to western mind but it would not impress Kashmiris who were to
                                be asked lay down their arms. He was certain they would refuse stop
                                fighting on such flimsy guarantees, particularly since they now felt
                                they had military advantage which they would not give up for “vague
                                promises”. I asked what sort settlement he considered would be
                                acceptable <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> and Kashmiris within
                                framework Chinese resolution. He replied (1) definite statement in
                                resolution that Pakistan forces were to be invited help maintain
                                order not vague procedure outlined point 4 <gloss

                                Abdullah with neutral outside administrator head of coalition. I
                                pointed out that this was not far different from what I understood
                                revised draft resolution provided since plebiscite administrator had
                                broad powers. He replied if <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> really
                                intended such solution let resolution clearly show intention. I
                                urged that confidence be placed fair intentions <gloss

                                said, if the instructions were clear and unequivocal on two points
                                mentioned above.</p>
                            <p>Finally he pointed out that <gloss target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> had

                                “delicate stage”. Following is substance information given Donovan
                                by Layard of UK High Commissioner’s Office:</p>

                                <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has told Hyderabad responsible
                                government must be introduced immediately and that constitution must
                                be framed by elected Constituent Assembly, also that communal armies
                                must be dissolved. Symon<note n="1" xml:id="d263fn1">A. C. B. Symon,

                                Hyderabad is compelled to accede by undue pressure, serious civil
                                disturbances will occur. V. P. Menon<note n="2" xml:id="d263fn2"
                                    >Secretary of the Ministry of States, India.</note> told
                                Mountbatten recently that if Mountbatten <pb n="337" xml:id="pg_337"

                                been settled by this time. Layard interprets Menon’s remark to mean
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has refrained from drastic
                                measures because of Mountbatten’s presence.</p>
                            <p>Layard said 300 British residents in Hyderabad city had worked out
                                their own defense scheme which includes 14 Americans residing there.

                                and he admits that even if riots occur, foreigners might not be
                                molested but points out and Embassy agrees that population of
                                Hyderabad at such times frequently reacts in violent and

                            <p>257. 1. Dept considers that Kashmir Plebiscite Administrator must be
                                man outstanding qualifications with established reputation India and
                                Pakistan. This would seem limit choice to Brit nationals or US
                                nationals known to India and Pakistan leaders through military or
                                other service in area. In view delicacy Brit position designation
                                Brit national probably impracticable. Dept is therefore willing have
                                US national designated Plebiscite Administrator.</p>
                            <p>2. In event <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> Pres must appoint
                                member or members to complete Commission, Dept does not wish US to
                                be so appointed and Pres should be so informed. If Pakistan does not
                                appoint its nominee within ten day period, Dept believes Turkey
                                would be sound choice for appointment by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> Pres as fourth Commission member. New Zealand or
                                Scandinavian state would be appropriate fifth member whether
                                appointed by Pres with Turkey or singly as a result of India and
                                Pakistan nominees failing to agree on fifth member.</p>
                            <p>3. As exception to first sentence, para 2, Dept considers US could
                                scarcely refuse appointment by <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                Pres as neutral fifth member Commission if it is clear that US
                                national is not to be designated Plebiscite Administrator.</p>
                            <p>4. If Pakistan does appoint its member Commission and if that member
                                and Czechoslovakia choose US as fifth member Commission, Dept
                                considers that US responsibilities as UN member would require
                                acceptance.</p>
                            <p>5. Dept does not consider it desirable for US national to serve as
                                Plebiscite Administrator and for US to serve also as Commission
                                member. However, if US is chosen Commission member pursuant to para
                                4, it may be necessary for US fill both posts.</p>

                                        administrator, is number one job. Patrick hopes and expects
                                        American to be elected chairman and believes chairman should
                                        proceed by air to Srinagar at earliest possible moment
                                        without stopping either at Delhi or Karachi. He thinks
                                        chairman should depart if necessary before other commission
                                        members ready to go and later convene commission Srinagar.
                                        Presence chairman, preferably with personal guard 10 or 20
                                        US Marines to build up his prestige, would in Patrick’s
                                        view, go far steady situation. Another prestige builder
                                        would be to fly chairman Srinagar in US military or
                                        presidential airplane.</item>

                                    the Resolution of April 21 but that if the Council should still
                                    decide to send out the Commission, the Government of India would

                            </p>
                            <p>Mr. V. P. Menon, Secretary of the Ministry of States, told an officer
                                of the Embassy that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> was
                                prepared to receive and cooperate with the United Nations Commission
                                and that the Indian Government had great hopes that the Commission
                                would be able to offer a constructive plan for the solution of the
                                Kashmir problem.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Menon said that the Government of India would be willing to
                                accept a solution based upon the partition of the State. According
                                to him the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would be willing to
                                let the areas of Mirpur and Poonch go to Pakistan. In reply to a
                                question he said that Gilgit could also go to Pakistan, which would
                                make that Dominion responsible for the defence of this area of the
                                world against Soviet aggression. He expressed his great fear of
                                Soviet infiltration through Gilgit and expressed doubt that Pakistan
                                would effectively prevent such infiltration. Mr. Menon said that the
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would never suggest the
                                partition of Kashmir as outlined above but would accept such a
                                solution if it should be made by the United Nations Commission. He
                                anticipates that if a solution is arrived at on the basis of
                                partition no plebiscite would be held.</p>
                            <p>In reply to a question, Mr. Menon admitted that it was true that
                                there were some Communists in the Kashmir National Conference but
                                that he was certain that their influence was not extensive.</p>
                            <p>In the opinion of the Embassy, Mr. Menon’s statement that the
                                Government of India would accept a solution of the Kashmir problem
                                based on partition is significant since in their past utterances
                                both Pandit Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah have declared that they were
                                unalterably opposed to partition. The Embassy believes—particularly
                                since Mr. Menon emphasized that, if the solution of partition is
                                adopted, no plebiscite will be held—the <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> is beginning to doubt that it would win a
                                plebiscite of all the inhabitants of the State on the question of

                                during official conversations in Karachi was informed that three
                                brigades Pakistan troops are inside Kashmir frontiers. India has not

                            <p>The Department will recall from this telegram that Sardar Patel
                                stated that the Government of India had now withdrawn its recent
                                offer to Hyderabad<note n="2" xml:id="d282fn2">Reference here is to

                                    between Hyderabad and the former Governor-General of India, Earl
                                    Mountbatten, who relinquished that position to Shri Chakravarti
                                    Rajagopalachari on June 21.</note> and that the State must now
                                accede to the Indian Union under the same conditions as all the
                                other Indian States. One of the officers of the Embassy called upon
                                Mr. V. P. Menon, Secretary of the Ministry of States, on July 17 in
                                order to ascertain definitely if the Government of India had
                                officially withdrawn the terms recently offered to the Nizam. Mr.
                                Menon stated that the offer had been withdrawn because it had been
                                rejected by the Nizam, and the Government of India did not feel that
                                it could hold its offer open for an indefinite period. Mr. Menon
                                added however that if the Government of India considered it
                                advisable it might offer the Nizam equally advantageous terms in the
                                future. It is the belief of the Embassy that Mr. Menon’s remark can
                                be interpreted only as an indication that the Government of India
                                will not insist that the Nizam must accede on precisely the same
                                terms as that of the other Princely States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Menon divulged some significant information regarding the
                                negotiations which took place in connection with the offer made to
                                the Nizam, the text of which was transmitted to the Department with
                                my despatch no. 702 dated June 19, 1948<note n="3" xml:id="d282fn3"
                                    >Not printed.</note> on the subject “Breakdown of Indo-Hyderabad
                                Negotiations”. In the first place Menon said that he did not
                                “honestly approve” of the terms offered to the Nizam. He also said
                                that the Governor-General at that time, Earl Mountbatten, had
                                obtained Sardar Patel’s approval of the draft agreement before he
                                (Menon) had had an opportunity to discuss it with Sardar Patel. Mr.
                                Menon had planned to reach Dehra Dun, where Sardar Patel was then
                                staying, for the purpose of discussing the draft agreement before
                                Earl Mountbatten arrived. Mr. Menon’s plane was delayed, however,
                                and Earl Mountbatten was able to obtain the Sardar’s approval after
                                stating that Menon concurred in offering such terms to the Nizam.
                                Mr. Menon said that if he had been able to reach Sardar Patel first
                                and inform the Sardar that he did not “honestly approve” of the plan
                                he was certain that the Sardar would have refused to approve it.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Menon said that he had told Mountbatten that, although he did not
                                object to Mountbatten “obtaining another feather in his cap” by
                                settling the Hyderabad problem, he doubted very much that the Nizam
                                would accept the terms of the offer, favorable as they were to
                                Hyderabad. Mr. Menon also stated that Sir Walter Monckton had been
                                    <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0369"/>genuinely eager to
                                arrive at an agreement. He said that Sir Walter had personally
                                drafted every provision of the offer made to Hyderabad and that he
                                himself “had not touched a pen” to the paper. According to Mr.
                                Menon, Sir Walter considered the terms offered as most generous and
                                told Earl Mountbatten and Mr. Menon that in his opinion India was
                                entitled to demand accession and the establishment of responsible
                                government in the State.</p>
                            <p>It is the firm view of Mr. Menon that Razvi<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d282fn4">Syed Mohamed Kasim Razvi, President of a
                                    politico-religious organization of Muslims in Hyderabad.</note>
                                exerts a controlling influence over the Nizam and consequently over
                                the policy of the Hyderabad Government. Mr. Menon said that during
                                the course of the Indo-Hyderabad negotiations the Government of
                                India had intercepted a letter from Razvi to a “Pakistan authority”
                                informing the latter that he did not have to worry about the
                                possible conclusion of an agreement with India as Razvi would always
                                “remain loyal” to Pakistan. When this letter was shown to
                                Mountbatten he expressed doubts regarding its authenticity. Mr.
                                Menon believes, however, that the refusal of the Nizam to accept
                                terms drafted by his adviser is clear evidence of a close
                                relationship between Pakistan policy and Hyderabad intransigence.
                                Another evidence which Mr. Menon cited of the dependence of the
                                Nizam on the counsel of Razvi was the fact that Sir Walter had been
                                unable to see the Nizam alone for the past four months. According to
                                Mr. Menon either Razvi or one of his followers was present at all
                                interviews between the Nizam and Sir Walter.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the future trend of Indo-Hyderabad relations Mr.
                                Menon expressed the opinion that the economic sanctions now being
                                applied by the Government of India against Hyderabad would not be
                                effective in compelling the Nizam to come to an agreement with
                                India. Mr. Menon believes that economic sanctions are effective only
                                when they are applied against a modern industrial state and not
                                against a feudal unit such as Hyderabad in which the standard of
                                living is extremely low; food resources are adequate; and the
                                average inhabitant is almost self-sufficient from the economic point
                                of view. As reported to the Department, Mr. Menon stated that
                                although he felt that military action against the State would afford
                                the only solution to the Hyderabad problem, his Government still
                                believes that a peaceful settlement may be achieved and is working
                                towards that end.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Menon then began on his own initiative to discuss the Kashmir
                                problem. He expressed the hope that the United Nations Commission
                                for India and Pakistan would be able to achieve a peaceful
                                settlement of this problem. Mr. Menon believes that the Indian
                                psychology must be taken into consideration by the Commission in
                                solving the Kashmir problem. According to him the Indian Government
                                and people are <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0370"/>convinced
                                that their action in going into Kashmir to defend the people of the
                                State against depredations of the raiders was morally right. They
                                feel that their motives have been impugned and that the United
                                Nations has refused to take this aspect of the problem into
                                consideration in its deliberations, and has deliberately refused to
                                recognize an obvious fact, namely, that the Pakistan Government has
                                been actively assisting the raiders even if it did not directly
                                instigate the invasion. Consequently, Mr. Menon feels that unless
                                the United Nations Commission makes some gesture to recognize the
                                moral motives behind the Kashmir policy of India as well as the
                                complicity of Pakistan in the invasion, there is no chance of
                                acceptance by the Government of India of any settlement terms
                                submitted by the Commission.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Menon feels that once such recognition is made the Government of
                                India will be willing to accept a solution based upon partition of
                                the State. Mr. Menon requested that this information be treated in
                                the strictest confidence as it would greatly weaken the Indian
                                position vis-à-vis Pakistan if the latter Government discovered that
                                India would accept partition. According to him, the Government of
                                India will accept a settlement based on the cession of Mirpur,
                                Poonch, Muzaffarabad and Gilgit to Pakistan. He also said that the
                                Government of India would accept the results of a plebiscite held in
                                the Vale of Kashmir to determine whether that area would go to India
                                or Pakistan and that it would be willing to withdraw all Indian
                                troops from the Vale during the time that the plebiscite was being
                                held. The only qualification which Mr. Menon made to the acceptance
                                of such a settlement by the Government of India was that the United
                                Nations must ensure the withdrawal of the Pakistan troops and the
                                raiders from the areas which they now occupy before any cease-fire
                                is issued. He said that the Government of India would not take
                                advantage of such a withdrawal by sending Indian troops into the
                                areas concerned and that, if the cease-fire order should break down,
                                Indian troops would not take advantage of the withdrawal of the
                                Pakistan troops to enter the area.</p>
                            <p>In the evaluation of Mr. Menon’s statement it should be taken into
                                consideration that, in opinion of the Embassy, Mr. Menon, along with
                                Sardar Patel, is much more interested in Hyderabad than in Kashmir.
                                Consequently, it is likely that he would be more conciliatory—as the
                                foregoing statements would appear to substantiate—than would certain
                                other Government of India leaders, particularly Pandit Nehru.
                                Nevertheless, the Embassy has been advised by various other key
                                officials in the Government of India, including Mr. M. K. Vellodi,
                                General Bucher and others, that they favor a solution of the Kashmir
                                problem predicated on the partition of the State and the Embassy is
                                therefore inclined to believe that such a solution is the most
                                feasible one at present.</p>

                                re-examination was made of various documents relating to the matter,
                                particularly the Indian Independence Act, the Stand-Still Agreement
                                between India and Hyderabad and, from Hansard, a number of pertinent
                                speeches made during the debate in Parliament over the Indian
                                Independence Bill. The purpose of this preliminary reexamination was
                                to attempt to clarify the legal aspects of the matter, particularly
                                the Nizam’s contention that with the British withdrawal from India,
                                the Princely States were given freedom to associate with one or
                                other of the Dominions or to remain independent. It was unanimously
                                agreed that on the basis of the Independence Act and the discussions
                                of the question of the future of the Princely States which took
                                place in Parliament that the Nizam did, in fact, have a rather
                                strong argument. Mr. Attlee is quoted on 10 July 1947 as follows:
                                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>“With the ending of the treaties and agreements, the States
                                        regain their independence. But they are part of geographical
                                        India, and their rulers and peoples are imbued with a
                                        patriotism no less great than that of their fellow Indians
                                        in British India. It would, I think, be unfortunate if,
                                        owing to the formal severance of their paramountcy relations
                                        with the Crown, they were to become islands cut off from the
                                        rest of India. The termination of their existing
                                        relationship with the Crown need have no such consequence.
                                        In fact, already a large number of the States have declared
                                        their willingness to enter into relationships with the new
                                        Dominions, and some have been represented in the Constituent
                                        Assembly of India. It is the hope of His Majesty’s
                                        Government that all States will, in due course, find their

                                    <p>“We warmly approve the decision of His Majesty’s Government
                                        to resist the pressure to transfer paramountcy to the
                                        successor governments. They have been very wise in that. I
                                        was glad to hear, or think I heard, the Prime Minister say
                                        that the States were to be absolutely free in their choice
                                        as to whether or not they should join one or other of the
                                        new Constitutent Assemblies; whether they should
                                        subsequently join one or other of the Dominions as they
                                        emerge from the Constituent Assemblies, or whether, finally,
                                        they will declare themselves free and independent sovereign
                                        authorities. I trust that this is true not only in words but
                                        in fact, because there have been disturbing rumours reaching
                                        us of a good deal of moral and even physical pressure which
                                        has been exercised, perhaps by misunderstanding of some of
                                        the official statements made in India or elsewhere”.<note

                            <p>It was suggested that it was these statements and others like them,
                                made by British officials at the time of the passage of the
                                Independence Act, which now cause British officials to say, as they
                                have to our Embassy in London, that if the case of Hyderabad were
                                brought to the UN, the British would be very embarrassed. Following

                                    >UNA</gloss>, Mr. Mathews suggested that the letter of the Nizam

                                    (845.00/8–1148).</note> were quite possibly steps, taken after
                                careful planning by the Hyderabad Government to insure that the case
                                might be given a hearing in the UN. Hyderabad would be able to argue
                                quite plausibly, in the event its appeals for good offices are not
                                granted, that it has exhausted every means except the UN to settle
                                the question. Various approaches to the letter were considered and
                                the ramifications of each approach were explored. It was generally
                                felt quite possible, indeed probable, that the Indian Government had
                                seen the Nizam’s letter. It was considered likely that it had been
                                carried by Beaumont who was searched by Indian Customs officials in
                                Delhi on July 22, at which time a letter of the Nizam to the King
                                was opened by Indian officials.</p>
                            <pb n="362" xml:id="pg_362" facs="0376"/>
                            <p>It was agreed that the British Government should be informed of the
                                receipt of the Nizam’s letter. It was also agreed that the Embassy
                                at London should be asked to be informed by the British Government
                                of the nature of the Nizam’s letter to the King, of the official
                                reaction to it, and of British thinking regarding Hyderabad
                                generally.</p>
                            <p>It was also agreed that probably, but dependent on London’s report,
                                it would be desirable to inform the Indians of the receipt of the
                                letter, particularly since it was felt quite likely that they
                                already knew of its existence and were probably deeply concerned
                                about it. It was conceded by all that the Indian Government would
                                take an extremely dim view of U.S. good offices in the Hyderabad
                                dispute. It was suggested that by conveying to the Indians the fact
                                that the letter had been received and was being given careful study,
                                apparent Indian plans to settle the question by a resort to force
                                might be retarded. Suggestion was made that the U.S. could not, for
                                obvious reasons accede to the request for good offices, unless a
                                parallel request was also made by the Government of India. This
                                development was considered extremely unlikely, and therefore a
                                suggested sequence of events might be (this, again, depends on the
                                nature of the British Government’s view) (1) for the U.S. to inform
                                the Indian Government of the receipt of the Nizam’s letter and the
                                fact of our considering it, and to ascertain the Indian reaction,
                                (2) at the same time taking the opportunity thus afforded to urge
                                the Indian Government to attempt again to reach a settlement through
                                peaceful negotiations. An acknowledgment of the letter from the
                                Nizam might be made verbally by our Embassies at London and New
                                Delhi to the Hyderabad representative at both posts, and the
                                opportunity would be taken to point out our feeling that our good
                                offices would be unavailing unless both parties to the dispute
                                desired them.</p>
                            <p>The possibility of a Commonwealth meeting or roundtable conference to
                                solve the problem was also discussed. The fact of heavy British
                                responsibility for the Hyderabad situation was noted.</p>
                            <p>It was suggested that if a written reply were to be made to the
                                Nizam’s letter, it should be sent through the <gloss

                            <p>American delegation is not sanguine that proposals will elicit

                            <p>Must frankly be stated Commission has received no expression sympathy
                                with agreement principle from either Indian or Pakistan officials
                                collectively or individually or any indication there might be

                                question. American delegations feeling is that position both
                                governments thus far is precisely same as when they presented their
                                views to <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> except that advance
                                Pakistan troops into Kashmir territory may have lessened chances
                                agreement unless they are promptly withdrawn. Majority commission
                                appeared convinced request for simple cease-fire agreement with no
                                conditions would be rejected. Consequently attempt was made to
                                present conditional proposals which might just possibly meet with
                                not too unfavorable reaction both governments. <pb n="365"

                                will need considerable clarification and which Indian and Pakistan

                                debate in which old arguments will be repeated. At this writing,
                                impossible speculate with any certainty on outcome much less make

                            <p>During Commission’s 5-week stay Delhi and Karachi position between
                                two governments has not noticeably improved. Inflammatory speeches
                                by Nehru in spite of Commission’s request for cooperation worsened
                                matters and in this respect Pakistan maintained correct attitude
                                except for remarks several obscure officials. Press both countries
                                continues play up hostilities but reports exaggerated present time
                                since action reduced to minimum by adverse weather conditions.
                                Rumors of strained relations circulate among observers situation,
                                one of which concerns possibility India severing diplomatic
                                relations with Pakistan unless Pakistan troops withdrawn to Pakistan
                                territory. Another rumor heard by American delegation after return
                                to Delhi says India only awaiting departure of UN Commission before
                                launching all-out blitz attack upon Hyderabad expecting Pakistan at
                                same time attempt big offensive Kashmir. This latter rumor seems
                                extremely improbable and is reported only because source who
                                informed American delegation is well informed and has hitherto
                                proved reliable.</p>
                            <p>It is of interest to report that on Friday just before departure
                                Commission group from Karachi to New Delhi, Zafrullah Khan demanded
                                hearing before Commission. After some quibbling in which he said he
                                could not be prepared until some time next week, he agreed appear
                                late Friday afternoon, when he made what he termed exposé to
                                Commission of subjects on which he felt Pakistan’s and his point of
                                view had not been sufficiently explored by Commission before its
                                decision which he “understood had been arrived at and was about to
                                be presented”. Zafrullah’s attitude toward Commission has been
                                patronizing and approaching arrogance and he has tended to endeavor
                                to assume position of superiority.</p>
                            <p>On this occasion he endeavored put Commission in a false position,
                                his purpose evidently being to establish grounds in case he felt
                                reaction Commission’s proposals necessary. American delegation was
                                not favorably impressed by his conduct and instead of improving he
                                prejudiced his personal standing. However there is little to choose
                                between Nehru and Aptel on one side and Johhan (who was not seen by
                                Commission) and Zafrullah Khan on the other. Competent circles here
                                and in Karachi continue to believe that Kashmir problem is dispute
                                between individuals highly placed rather than between peoples of
                                India and Pakistan.</p>

                                August 23. Razvi saw me 10 a. m. today and said he had unexpectedly
                                received orders last night to proceed Hyderabad for consultation. He
                                then said he had received Department’s note from <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. He inquired whether penultimate
                                sentence of Department’s note implied US would be willing act as
                                arbiter in event both Hyderabad and <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> made such request. I replied that such an
                                interpretation had not occurred to me and that the phrase “good
                                offices” which Razvi had cited in support of his interpretation, was
                                frequently used in diplomatic correspondence without involving any
                                implication of arbitration. I stressed that point. I then said I had
                                no authority to speak for our government regarding its acting as
                                arbiter between <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> and Hyderabad
                                and cautioned <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0383"/>Razvi against
                                raising any hopes in Hyderabad that US would if requested act as
                                arbiter.</p>
                            <p>I am convinced Razvi’s visit to Hyderabad is not connected with
                                Department’s note and that his query was based solely on his desire
                                to clarify in his own mind foregoing point prior to his unexpected
                                departure. Embassy does not believe <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> would under any circumstances consent to
                                arbitration, so point raised by Razvi is not a live issue.</p>

                                cease-fire. Circumstances surrounding this request are set forth in
                                separate telegram from <gloss target="#t_USUN1">USUN</gloss> to
                                    Dept,<note n="1" xml:id="d294fn1">Telegram 1057, August 24, from
                                    Ambassador Austin, not printed.</note> being relayed to you.</p>
                            <p>Dept considers question of observers of considerable political
                                importance. Although number now being requested appears small, basis
                                for meeting present request would become more significant if
                                eventual number of observers is greatly increased. Important
                                elements in problem of furnishing observers for Kashmir are: (1)
                                remoteness of Kashmir and great expense involved in providing large
                                numbers of personnel and considerable equipment from outside; (2)
                                special experience of British with area and peoples involved; (3)
                                experience of Muslim and Hindu troops in operating together prior to
                                partition of India; (4) conditions in Kashmir exposing it to those
                                whose primary objective would be to make trouble.</p>
                            <p>Dept would prefer not to make issue in <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> on the selection of observers and would hope that a
                                workable arrangement could be made by the Commission itself. Our
                                preference would be to use British observers, assisted by truce
                                teams furnished by military personnel from Indian and Pakistani
                                armies. Kashmir Commission might be able to arrange such observation
                                either on basis of consultation with India and Pakistan or on basis
                                of decision of Commission itself. As minimum, Commission might ask
                                British to make twenty observers <pb n="370" xml:id="pg_370"
                                    facs="0384"/>available as a temporary measure pending further
                                development of negotiations on the cease-fire.</p>
                            <p>We understand that Kashmir Commission has not acted officially on
                                this matter and that Chairman and Secretary of Commission might be

                                        of the Charter of the UN, requests you to bring to the
                                        attention of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> the grave
                                        dispute which has arisen between Hyderabad and India and
                                        which, unless settled in accordance with international law
                                        and justice, is likely to endanger the maintenance of
                                        international peace and security. Hyderabad has been exposed
                                        in recent months to violent intimidation, to threats of
                                        invasion, and to crippling economic blockade, which has
                                        inflicted cruel hardship upon the people of Hyderabad and
                                        which is intended to coerce it into a renunciation of its
                                        independence. The frontiers have been forcibly violated and
                                        Hyderabad villages have been occupied by Indian troops. The
                                        action of India threatens the existence of Hyderabad, the
                                        peace of the Indian and entire Asiatic continent, and the
                                        principles of the UN. The Government of Hyderabad is

                                        the obligations of pacific settlement provided in the

                            <p>434. <gloss target="#t_Comkas1">Comkas</gloss> 29. Commission
                                returned Karachi Saturday to resume conversations with Pakistan
                                officials endeavor persuade Pakistan Government to accept its
                                proposals for cease-fire and truce agreement. First indications are
                                that Pakistanis remain firm that it must be either unconditional
                                cease-fire or if conditional then entire program for plebiscite must
                                be worked out and agreed upon.</p>
                            <p>Commission’s standpoint is that latter is not feasible and that
                                unconditional cease-fire would be flatly rejected by India. Thus
                                neither is workable.</p>
                            <p>India demands withdrawal Pakistan troops from Kashmir territory
                                probably justifiably. Pakistan is equally insistent Indian troops
                                get out of Kashmir perhaps less justifiably. Commission feels its
                                proposals meet Indian demands and at same time satisfy what may be
                                reasonable demand by Pakistan that majority Indian forces be
                                required to withdraw so that they will no longer constitute what
                                Pakistan claims is menace to its existence as state.</p>
                            <p>Pakistan officials however now claim Commission’s proposals do not
                                enable them to assure tribesmen of ultimate fair plebiscite and
                                protection their co-religionists, so they cannot control tribesmen.
                                Commission insists that this is explicitly called for in
                                proposals.</p>
                            <p>I get impression in going over these and other points that Pakistanis
                                do not want to be convinced; that they wanted some action on
                                Commission’s part which would in some way recognize or tacitly
                                approve Pakistan Army invasion of Kashmir and leave these forces
                                there, with result that no plebiscite or any other peaceable
                                measures could ever be worked out; and that they are grievously
                                disappointed at failure. On other hand while India has signified
                                acceptance, it is undeniable that Nehru looks on proposals with
                                great disfavor.</p>
                            <p>Moreover I feel that Zafrullah Khan finds his government now bearing
                                onus of rejection which he had formerly passed back to Security
                                Council with criticism of its plan but he was not standing alone
                                since India for other reasons had also rejected <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> proposals. Refusal to agree to cease
                                fighting and arrange truce so that negotiations for peaceful
                                solution can proceed is not easy to justify. He is therefore
                                resorting to all available devices in effort to evade issue. That he
                                may decide ignore Commission and take issue to <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> is possibility. He is not aware of
                                India’s decision so far as I know.</p>
                            <p>India’s approach is very like that of Pakistan. India originally
                                expected <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> decision its favor
                                otherwise would never have presented case and has continued same
                                position. But India’s present troubles have <pb n="372"
                                    xml:id="pg_372" facs="0386"/>occasioned increasing desire some
                                influential elements Delhi to end “this Kashmir business”. Both
                                Maharajah and Sheikh Abdullah losing favor and former almost
                                completely ignored.</p>
                            <p>Situation is something like tri-cornered war nerves. Some members of
                                Commission showing strain to certain extent and their judgment and
                                decisions tending to be less wisely considered.</p>
                            <p>This leads me to suggest that Department and <gloss target="#t_USUN1"
                                    >USUN</gloss> might think of desirability of appointment of
                                moderator to succeed Commission if perchance both governments accept
                                its proposals and also in event of failure. My experience leads me
                                to believe that one man, of international stature, if acceptable to
                                both governments, would be in better position to work out this
                                problem than is an unwieldly commission. He would need small corps
                                expert advisers.</p>
                            <p>In case Commission does not succeed matter would become urgent, and
                                some action might have to be taken by <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                                might be able to save situation.</p>

                                to present matter under Art 35 (2) you should take following

                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>There is considerable doubt as to Hyderabad’s legal status
                                        as “state” within meaning of Art 35 in light of its past

                            <p>A–352. In a conversation with a representative of the Embassy, Akhtar
                                Hussain, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
                                Commonwealth Relations, declared that Pakistan would support
                                vigorously Hyderabad’s case if it were to be considered by the
                                Security Council or General Assembly. Hussain did not indicate
                                whether or not Pakistan would act as sponsor for Hyderabad, although
                                the Embassy’s representative did not put this question to him
                                directly. Hussain emphasized the fact that his Government feels
                                there is a close relation between the Kashmir and Hyderabad
                                problems. Pakistan is inclined to think that it would gain
                                considerable advantage in the <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374"
                                    facs="0388"/>Kashmir dispute if India’s arguments in the two
                                cases could be placed side by side. He also remarked on the obvious
                                military relationship of the two problems as far as India was
                                concerned and expressed the opinion that if Hyderabad was out of the
                                way “India would not allow the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1"
                                    >UNCIP</gloss> to set foot again in India”. Hussain reiterated
                                the fear that India’s first step in Hyderabad would be the complete
                                liquidation of the Muslim minority which would be accompanied by
                                wide anti-Muslim outbreaks in the rest of the Dominion.</p>

                                concluded with commission’s proposals under consideration by
                                Pakistan and Zafrullah proceeding quietly over weekend to lay them
                                before Jinnah. After much urging Foreign Minister promised might be
                                possible give oral reply Sunday afternoon. Commission considered
                                urgency increased because Nehru advised us Thursday he proposed
                                expose Kashmir situation Indian parliament before its adjournment
                                fifth. This implied publication commission’s proposals before
                                Pakistan response received and to save Pakistan any possible
                                embarrassment commission has endeavored persuade Nehru delay and

                                They know commission has India’s answer. I suspect however, Pakistan
                                is not much concerned about India’s reception proposals and <pb
                                    n="375" xml:id="pg_375" facs="0389"/>that their decision will
                                not be particularly influenced by that consideration and my belief
                                was partly confirmed by their seeming indifference when informed
                                possible developments.</p>
                            <p>Pakistan effort during whole week of almost continuous conferences
                                has been to obtain either modification of proposals or explanation
                                which would convey meaning other than that actually stated and
                                intended. They particularly endeavored obtain commitments re
                                administration and maintenance law and order in territory under
                                Indian control which we know India would not accept and are
                                determined to find some means whereby they could infiltrate to
                                expand their activity and influence. But they insisted most on
                                commission adding to proposals commitments regarding plebiscite
                                which commission could not consistently undertake. In this both
                                Prime Minister and Foreign Minister especially latter were
                                unreasonable and Foreign Minister resorted to every forensic
                                artifice in his efforts. Their position was that they must have
                                plebiscite program settled so that they could give positive
                                assurances to tribesmen and Azad Kashmir in endeavoring persuade
                                them to lay down their arms.</p>
                            <p>Commission exercised great patience, satisfied every reasonable
                                demand for hearing, listened to Foreign Minister for hours, and
                                endeavored to give firm well reasoned and logical explanations.</p>
                            <p>Commission is more than ever convinced that military activity must
                                cease if any plebiscite is to be worked out and that two phases must
                                be handled separately. It would be simply impossibility to comply
                                with Pakistan demand that terms of plebiscite be agreed upon
                                simultaneously with cease fire because such complicated agreement
                                could not be effected in present temper both disputants and meantime
                                fighting would continue with all its dangers of sudden engulfment

                                in such form that they realize responsibility they would assume by
                                rejection. Proposals have therefore not been summarily turned down
                                but on contrary have been thoroughly debated. Now there is at least
                                an even chance of their acceptance but no prediction can be made
                                with any degree of certainty. Perhaps they themselves do not know
                                until they have the decision of their volatile and redoubtable
                                Governor General whose authority in this matter, so intimately
                                related to his empire building, seems supreme.</p>

                            <p>Commission has not required acceptance of Government of India to

                                specified in foregoing and is convinced introduction controversial
                                details at present stage would simply and needlessly prolong
                                discouraging negotiations while dangerous hostilities continue.
                                Effect, therefore, of Pakistan decision is nonacceptance
                                Commission’s August 13 proposals cease-fire and truce agreement.</p>
                            <p>In addition Foreign Minister’s letter September 6 states views of
                                Pakistan Government not binding on Azad Kashmir Government nor do
                                they reflect Azad Kashmir views. This is in contravention to
                                assurances previously given to Commission by both Pakistan Foreign
                                Minister and Pakistan High Command. As now presented Pakistan
                                confronts Commission with necessity obtaining independent Azad
                                Kashmir consent to present and future proposals. In other respects
                                Foreign Minister’s communication misstates Commission’s standpoint
                                and endeavors commit Commission to future dispositions regarding
                                which it has advisedly held decisions in abeyance pending
                                effectuation cease-fire and truce agreement.</p>
                            <p>While acceptance by India of Commission’s August 13 proposals need
                                not be taken at complete face value, it did express agreement of
                                India to cease-fire and negotiations for truce. Pakistan’s
                                proposition introduces subjects for negotiation which have
                                previously been points of controversy and in effect were rejected by
                                both India and Pakistan. <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0391"

                                injection of controversial features at present stage will
                                effectively obstruct attainment objectives Commission’s August 13

                            <p>On return to Delhi ninth, commission had interview with Nehru and
                                Bajpai and informed them personally re Pakistan’s qualified
                                acceptance which amounts to rejection its proposals. Nehru plainly
                                disappointed result. Commission asked whether his government would
                                consider first, simple cease-fire; if not, second, codicil or
                                supplement to agreement, giving Pakistan some assurance re
                                plebiscite such as requested by Pakistan; and third, whether India
                                would be willing engage conferences with Pakistan to break present
                                stalemate. Nehru pointed out futility conversations at present
                                stage. He apparently ruled out cease-fire but seems to have thought
                                possibility working out supplement to commission’s proposals to
                                cover plebiscite might just possibly be worthy further
                                consideration. In any event, he did not flatly reject commission’s
                                suggestion.</p>
                            <p>Conclusion, however, seems almost inevitable that India and Pakistan
                                will not come together on mutually satisfactory terms now; that

                                the Commission and the Governments of India and Pakistan since the
                                presentation of the Commission’s resolution of August 13, and the
                                comments of Sir Zafrullah Khan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of
                                Pakistan, at his press conference on September 8 on the statement of
                                Pandit Nehru before the Indian Parliament on September 7.</p>
                            <p>Ambassador Huddle has furnished the Department copies of the
                                documents released to the press by the Commission. There are
                                enclosed copies of the “Sind Observer” of September 9 which contain
                                an account of Sir Zafrullah’s press conference. It is assumed that
                                the Embassy at New Delhi is furnishing the Department with the text
                                of Prime Minister Nehru’s statement before the Indian Parliament.
                                All of these documents should be read in close connection if a fair
                                understanding is to be obtained of the problems which perplexed the
                                Commission before it finally decided that further effort toward a
                                solution of the Kashmir question would probably be largely useless,
                                or, as indicated in the communiqué which it issued as an
                                accompaniment to the released documents, that “immediate
                                effectuation of its proposal of August 13 is not to be
                                envisaged.”</p>
                            <p>It was perhaps a foregone conclusion that however impartial, sincere
                                and understanding the members of the Commission might be their <pb

                                failure because any concessions which the Commission might make to
                                meet the point of view of the Government of India would be
                                unacceptable to the Government of Pakistan and vice versa. The
                                Commission also felt itself obliged to work under the very serious
                                handicap of the presence of regular Pakistan army forces in
                                Kashmir.</p>
                            <p>The Government of India has held from the very beginning that its
                                quick acceptance of the Maharaja of Kashmir’s hasty offer of
                                accession to India was occasioned and necessitated by the invasion
                                of Kashmir by hostile forces from Pakistan, and India’s case before
                                the United Nations Security Council was based exclusively on the cry
                                that aggression against Indian territory was being committed by
                                Pakistan although at that time Pakistan had no regular troops in
                                Kashmir and had none in Kashmir until May of this year. India has at
                                no time admitted that there was an uprising of people in Kashmir
                                against the Maharaja and his dictatorial regime, which is more
                                accurately what sent the Maharaja on his hurried way to seek
                                accession to India, and through that medium Indian assistance in
                                crushing the rebellion. Whatever the true facts may be, however, the
                                Commission accepted the fact of accession as legal, and on that
                                basis the Commission logically followed with the conclusion that
                                Pakistan, was, as represented by the Government of India, guilty of
                                aggression in this sense against India because of the presence of
                                regular Pakistan forces in Kashmir. While I have no knowledge that
                                the Commission actually accused the Government of Pakistan of
                                aggression in this sense, I know that the members of the Commission
                                held that view and that the Government of Pakistan felt that there
                                was this implication in the Commission’s resolution of August 13,
                                which requires the withdrawal of Pakistan troops, the presence of
                                which “in the territory of the state of Jammu and Kashmir
                                constitutes a material change in the situation since it was
                                represented by the Government of Pakistan before the Security
                                Council,” prior to any movement for the withdrawal of Indian
                                forces.</p>
                            <p>The Government of Pakistan has not been willing to concede that it is
                                in any sense guilty of aggression against Indian territory. As Sir
                                Zafrullah points out in his interview with the press, the Government
                                of Pakistan is not even willing to acknowledge that Kashmir has
                                legally acceded to India. The Government here holds that it is
                                strange reasoning on the part of Pandit Nehru that carries him to
                                the conclusion that whereas the accession of Kashmir to India is
                                legal the accession of Junagadh to Pakistan is illegal and that
                                while he cries out against Pakistan’s aggression against Indian
                                territory (Kashmir) he sees nothing wrong in India’s aggression
                                against Junagadh. Although he searches his soul to put his actions
                                on a high moral plane he sees <pb n="381" xml:id="pg_381"

                                (because he was in a hurry) but sees much wrong in the Nawab of
                                Junagadh’s carrying his predominately Hindu state into a union with
                                Pakistan. The Maharaja had the authority to accede but the Nawab had
                                no such authority.</p>
                            <p>The presence of raiders from Pakistan, and later of Pakistan troops,
                                in Kashmir has sorely troubled Pandit Nehru. He makes a great moral
                                issue of Pakistan’s perfidy and duplicity in this connection but he
                                makes no allusion to the invasion of Junagadh by Indian troops and
                                the complete suppression by India of the former government of that
                                state. Perhaps he, like his colleague Patel, regards Junagadh as no
                                longer an issue, or, at best, it is an irrelevant issue. The feeling
                                in Pakistan is quite the contrary, and the thinking of the
                                Government of Pakistan with particular reference to the Commission’s
                                resolution of August 13 is definitely conditioned by its own
                                conception of Indian perfidy and duplicity in Kashmir, in the matter
                                of Junagadh, and in no small measure in the matter of Hyderabad, and
                                its consequent utter lack of faith in the word and good intentions
                                of Nehru and Patel and, going further, its probable lack of faith
                                not in the good intentions of the Commission but in the ability of
                                the Commission to suppress or control Indian perfidy.</p>
                            <p>It was for the latter reason particularly that Sir Zafrullah, to the
                                chagrin and perhaps even to the amusement of the members of the
                                Commission, so insistently held on behalf of Pakistan that any
                                “clarifications and elucidations” which may have been given to India
                                by the Commission must be plainly stated for the information of
                                Pakistan and vice versa. The Commission has felt that this has been
                                nothing more or less than quibbling and stalling on the part of Sir
                                Zafrullah, and there may, in fact, be much to support this
                                conclusion, but on the other hand it also seems probable that Sir
                                Zafrullah knows his opponents.</p>
                            <p>Pandit Nehru says that the Government of India, notwithstanding that
                                there were many matters in the resolution which went against the
                                grain, nevertheless accepted the resolution without reservation. He
                                says that India accepted the cease fire proposal without
                                qualification because of Indian interest in peace and international
                                order and as a gesture of good will towards the United Nations,
                                whereas Pakistan after much delay and the writing of many letters
                                refused to accept the proposal. One has but to read Pandit Nehru’s
                                two letters of August 20<note n="3" xml:id="d304fn3">For texts, see

                                to the Commission’s resolution of August 13 to observe how
                                unconditionally Nehru accepted on behalf of the Government of India
                                    <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0396"/>the resolution. Among
                                other reservations Pandit Nehru states twice in his first letter
                                that should it be decided to seek a solution of the future of the
                                state of Jammu and Kashmir by means of a plebiscite Pakistan shall
                                have no part in the organization and conduct of the plebiscite or in
                                any other matter of internal administration in the State. Is it
                                honestly to be expected that Pakistan could accept such a condition?
                                Apart from other considerations, this reservation is hardly in line
                                with the Security Council’s resolution of April 21, 1948 and with
                                the spirit of the discussions which clearly indicated the acceptance
                                by the Security Council of a legitimate interest by Pakistan in the
                                holding of the plebiscite.</p>
                            <p>Actually the position of Pakistan with regard to the Commission’s
                                resolution of August 13 is that the resolution is not rejected but
                                that it cannot be accepted without Pakistan being given further
                                “clarifications and elucidations” on the subject of verbal or other
                                assurances given to the Government of India by the Commission. As
                                already stated, the members of the Commission regarded this request
                                as quibbling and stalling, and as their patience had already been
                                worn thin they decided to discontinue further discussions of the
                                problem unless resumption of negotiations may subsequently be found
                                desirable as a result of any change of attitude which may occur on
                                the part of either of the two governments. Inasmuch, however, as it
                                appears to be the determination of the Commission to alter in no
                                particular whatever the terms of its resolution of August 13 or to
                                offer any further clarifications it is freely conceded that in all
                                probability the work of the Commission is finished. The Commission
                                is not necessarily to blame for its failure, and there is no
                                indication that the Government of Pakistan holds any grudge against
                                the Commission, although it does feel that the resolution was
                                plainly unfavorable to Pakistan and involved concessions on the part
                                of Pakistan which could not, for practical reasons as well as for
                                reasons of principle, be conceded.</p>
                            <p>From a practical point of view the Government of Pakistan was faced,
                                or believed that it was faced, with the necessity of sending its
                                troops into Kashmir to take up a defensive line to meet an offensive
                                which the Government of India was mounting and which if carried
                                through successfully would have had disastrous consequences to
                                Pakistan through the submerging of the northern part of the country
                                with refugees from Kashmir and exposing the rear and flank of
                                Pakistan to an invasion by Indian forces. Pandit Nehru dismisses
                                this explanation out of hand as being false and fictitious and
                                nothing other than a cover for wanton aggression against India.
                                Whatever Nehru’s real thinking on the subject may be, and his
                                thoughts might well be different from his words, Pakistan looked at
                                the problem in terms of the estimated danger to its own security and
                                took such measures as it <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0397"
                                />felt necessary for the protection of that security in what was
                                regarded as a purely defensive sense. There is no doubt that had
                                Pakistan informed the Security Council, as Nehru suggests, of its
                                movement of regular troops into Kashmir, Pakistan’s moral position
                                vis-à-vis the Commission would have been stronger although legally
                                and technically the probabilities are that the Commission would have
                                regarded Pakistan’s position as still being weak and indefensible in
                                that particular. Incidentally it would also have deprived Nehru of
                                one of his crying points at this time, to the advantage of Pakistan,
                                a point perhaps not beyond his appreciation.</p>
                            <p>One is inclined to wonder what might have happened to Pakistan had
                                the regular troops not been moved into Kashmir. The consequences of
                                its failure to protect itself might then have been better understood
                                by the members of the Commission, for there is no denying that it
                                was the presence of Pakistan troops in Kashmir that broke the back
                                of the Indian offensive which, incidentally, was mounted long after
                                India, like Pakistan, had agreed to the Security Council’s request
                                that neither party do anything to aggravate the situation in
                                Kashmir. In any event, Pakistan feels that it has no apologies to
                                offer for what it did in the above connection, and though Nehru may
                                proclaim to the world, as he does, the guilt of Pakistan there is
                                little or no likelihood that Pakistan will put itself in the
                                position of voluntarily accepting from the Commission what it
                                regards as a proclamation of guilt.</p>
                            <p>There is another consideration also to be taken into account in
                                explaining why the Government of Pakistan would probably be
                                unwilling, as required under the terms of the present resolution, to
                                withdraw its troops from Kashmir even if the Government of India
                                could be relied upon not to resume its offensive. The withdrawal of
                                Pakistan troops from Kashmir without something very practical and
                                substantial in return, something which the tribal peoples of the
                                North West Frontier and the people of Azad Kashmir could understand
                                in their simple minds as a satisfactory return for this concession,
                                there is little doubt but that these peoples would rise up in holy
                                wrath against the Government of Pakistan for surrendering, as they
                                would regard it, to the Government of India on so vital a matter.
                                There is a serious question in my mind whether the Government of
                                Pakistan feels that it is strong enough to resist any such movement.
                                The tribesmen, being restive about the situation of their brethren
                                in Kashmir, were only partially satisfied when Pakistan finally sent
                                its regular troops into that territory. The three or four hundred
                                thousand already armed fighting men of the North West Frontier area,
                                entirely apart from the inhabitants of Azad Kashmir territory, would
                                be a serious problem for the Government of Pakistan should they
                                decide, as they might <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0398"/>very
                                well decide, to rise against Pakistan if this country should now
                                give the appearance of abandoning the Muslims of Kashmir.</p>

                                New Delhi enclosing an “unofficial note” issued by the Bureau of
                                Information of the Jammu and Kashmir government reporting that
                                dissension exists within the Azad Kashmir movement. This Embassy has
                                no information which would support that report. Chaudhry Ghulam
                                Abbas and Sardar Mohammad Ibrahim, who describe themselves
                                respectively as Supreme Head of the Azad Kashmir Liberty Movement
                                and President of the Azad Kashmir Government, appear to be working
                                in close cooperation and in complete harmony, and while there may
                                be, as is natural in human affairs, differences of opinion between
                                these persons and others, no intimation has reached Karachi that
                                there are any serious rifts in the Azad movement, nor does there
                                appear to be any reason to believe, as has lately been rumoured,
                                that there are any differences between the Azad Kashmir leaders and
                                the Government of Pakistan. It is my opinion, however, as previously
                                intimated, that the Government of Pakistan did not dare to make any
                                concessions to the India-Pakistan Commission which would have
                                aroused intense disgruntlement amongst the Azad Kashmir or tribal
                                ledders. In the latter connection it should be pointed out that
                                Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas and Sardar Ibrahim have expressed strong
                                disagreement with Nehru’s statement before the Indian Parliament and
                                have issued a joint statement, published in today’s press, in which
                                they assert that the Commission’s proposals in their present form
                                are totally unacceptable to Azad Kashmir. A copy of this joint
                                statement as published in “Dawn” of September 10, is enclosed as
                                being pertinent, even though the Commission has so far shown what
                                superficially appears to be little interest in the Azad Kashmir
                                Government and its point of view.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the fighting in Kashmir continues as far as monsoon
                                conditions and the terrain permit. Although aerial attacks by Indian
                                bombers have lately been more frequent the Azad Kashmir forces
                                appear to be holding their own and to be operating in Some areas at
                                an advantage.</p>

                            <p>Bucher told me yesterday all British officers with Hyderabad army had
                                resigned. He said Indian army would be in Hyderabad city five days
                                after it crossed frontier taking into account maximum resistance
                                which might be offered. He said Hyderabad had no bombers but that
                                they might use Dakotas to drop bombs; however he does not consider
                                bombing by Hyderabad planes a problem.</p>
                            <p>He expressed concern over presence in Hyderabad of 5,000 Pathans
                                including civilians and soldiers and said they would be serious
                                problem in event civil disturbances.</p>

                                recommendation might provoke unnecessary extended debate in Council
                                re desirability Commission vs moderator and re new terms reference.
                                Also feel such step might have psychological disadvantage of
                                appearing abandon progress reached so far, instead of building on

                            <p>1. When I advised Bajpai this morning of observations of Department
                                contained <gloss target="#t_Deptel1">Deptel</gloss> 551 he said any
                                remarks he might make should not be construed as in any way
                                prejudicing <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> position that
                                Hyderabad question is purely internal problem. He said he
                                appreciated friendly spirit in which Department had approached
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>. Before commenting on
                                question UN supervising plebiscite Hyderabad, he wished inquire
                                exactly what role US envisaged for UN. While Bajpai did not commit
                                himself definitely, it is my impression that UN role, according to
                                Indian view, would have to be limited to observation.</p>

                                resentment at trend US policy was taking as indicated Rama Rau’s
                                telegram. He apparently did not fully understand contents of
                                telegram as he said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> would never
                                on principle permit UN interference, but <gloss target="#t_GOI1"

                                along these lines, Menon retreated and said while <gloss

                            <p>Menon reiterated <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> view Hyderabad
                                issue purely internal issue since Hyderabad has no international <hi

                                identical position as other Indian states and asked if, in case
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had difficulty with Baroda,
                                UN would feel it should intervene. He also said if principle UN

                                relations accepted, it was possible that whole structure of
                                accession states to India would collapse. He emphasized that
                                Jodhpur, other Rajputana states and Jaipur were waiting for any
                                indication weakness <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> policy

                            <p>Embassy suggests Department give careful consideration following

                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>-Hyderabad dispute: (1) While V. P.
                                Menon possibly exaggerated danger, Embassy believes Princes would
                                not hesitate take advantage any evidence weakness central government
                                to reobtain former position of power or even attempt establish
                                independence; (2) moreover Embassy feels India will strongly oppose
                                attempt bring Hyderabad dispute within purview UN and would so
                                greatly resent efforts US and Great Britain achieve this objective
                                that friendly relations between India and democracies would be
                                seriously, if not irreparably, damaged. Thus instead of neutral
                                India which despite its neutrality has many bonds friendship and
                                affection uniting it with west, India might become more closely
                                associated with USSR in international field; (3) lack of resistance
                                by Hyderabad troops and speed Indian advance leads Embassy believe
                                UN may find itself dealing with a <hi rend="italic">fait
                                    accompli</hi> with respect Hyderabad. While Embassy appreciates
                                UN position with respect Hyderabad dispute, there is strong
                                possibility UN intervention will increase difficulties solution
                                Hyderabad problem because of encouragement it will give Nizam not to
                                arrive agreement with India; (4) moreover, Embassy suggests
                                Department bear in mind that disintegrative forces in India are
                                already strong and any encouragement given to Hyderabad, leaders of
                                which interested mostly in maintenance their own power, would to
                                certain degree jeopardize stability India which, with all its
                                weakness, is probably strongest bastion against further advance

                                officials on other. Nizam, interested only in future himself and
                                dynasty and almost helpless vis-à-vis Razarkar extremists, decided
                                there should be no effective opposition to Indian Army by Hyderabad
                                state troops. Razarkars notably oppose organized force. With Indian
                                Army in control, Nizam can now effectively disband Razarkars and
                                come to terms with <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> which under

                            <p>Bajpai said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> hoped military
                                administration would not last more than two weeks but that again it
                                was impossible give definite answer this question until extent of
                                guerilla activities in which Razarkars might engage could be

                            <p>He said plebiscite might be held on basis adult suffrage or by
                                election to legislative body but emphasized none of these questions
                                could be answered now.</p>
                            <p>He said <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> must take into account
                                public opinion in India which is incensed over atrocities Razarkars;
                                for example, Socialists are urging Nizam be deposed while other
                                groups are urging immediate setting up of congress government in
                                Hyderabad. Bajpai said task of <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                in dealing with foregoing groups would not be made easier if
                                impression was obtained in India that pressure was being put on
                                India from Outside with respect to dealing with Hyderabad. By this I
                                am sure he meant too much debate on the subject at UN especially at
                                this time. Embassy believes that extended discussion of Hyderabad
                                question at Paris at this time will not make <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> position easier vis-à-vis public opinion in

                            <p>I emphasized that interest of US Hyderabad question sprang only from
                                US position as outlined paragraph 2 <gloss target="#t_Deptel1"
                                    >Deptel</gloss> 551, September 14 and repeated that US had at
                                all times carefully avoided encouraging aspirations of states such
                                as Hyderabad and Travancore. Bajpai again said he appreciated
                                friendly spirit of US approach and said he had discussed question
                                with Prime Minister and that his remarks to me today should be
                                considered as Prime Minister’s as well as his own.</p>

                                Governor General sent for me 5 p. m. today. He referred my talk with
                                Bajpai today and expressed his appreciation US approach Hyderabad
                                question.</p>
                            <p>He said he was faced with very difficult position re Hyderabad owing
                                to high state of feeling in India against Nizam and Razakar. He said
                                he hoped to keep Nizam on throne and that he was working to that end
                                because it was best for India that Nizam and his dynasty should be
                                maintained. However, his Governor General’s position was already
                                sufficiently difficult owing internal opposition (Asaf Ali’s speech
                                at Bombay<note n="1" xml:id="d321fn1">Asaf Ali was India’s first
                                    Ambassador to the United States, February 1947 to April
                                    1948.</note>) without added difficulty of pressure from outside
                                to hasten plebiscite and bring UN into plebiscite. He told me he
                                would do everything possible to retain Nizam as constitutional
                                monarch and could practically assure me he would succeed provided
                                public opinion in India was not still further irritated by outside
                                interference. He assured me people of Hyderabad would be given every
                                opportunity to have representative government of their own
                                choice.</p>
                            <p>Governor General made it plain he thought UN participation
                                unnecessary and, in view state public opinion India, unwise.</p>
                            <p>Embassy requests Department to evaluate foregoing in light of
                                Governor General’s well-known policy of tolerance, common sense, and
                                forebearance in political questions; Nizam’s penchant for intrigue
                                and double-dealing as exemplified by fact that practically no
                                resistance <pb n="400" xml:id="pg_400" facs="0414"/>was offered to
                                Indian Army and finally that in last analysis Hyderabad is not
                                entitled to any better treatment than Gwalior, Indore, Bhopal or
                                Baroda. States problem is a matter of life and death to India and
                                Embassy must emphasize that putting Nizam on different plane that
                                foregoing states must inevitably lead to difficulties with other
                                states which have acceded to Indian Union.</p>
                            <p>Embassy believes American interests would best be served by not
                                insisting Hyderabad case be kept on UN agenda in face of Nizam’s
                                withdrawal and in not insisting UN participation in plebiscite. In
                                arriving this conclusion character and integrity of Nizam, which
                                Embassy cannot consider high, must be considered. People of
                                Hyderabad barring ruling clique and small group extremists, will be
                                just as happy under <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> rule as
                                under Nizam and over period of years they will benefit. Foregoing
                                represents considered opinion Embassy, in arriving at which,
                                American interests have at all times been the paramount
                                consideration.</p>

                            <p>Zafrullah Khan is, I am convinced, of belief he can divide <gloss

                                He has sorely tried my own patience by obvious forensic trickery.

                                He also has consistently endeavored put on Commission burden which
                                can only be borne by Pakistan and India, and from beginning resented
                                terms of Commission’s proposals which clearly placed
                                responsibility.</p>
                            <p>Both India and Pakistan demand for selves all of Kashmir. Both fear

                                moment. In background is religious question.</p>
                            <p>However, informal discussions in Paris might tend first to press for
                                acceptance Commission’s resolution August 13 as it stands;
                                Zafrullah’s objections are not well founded. If that effort fails,
                                then, second, to press Indians to accept brief outline of plebiscite
                                arrangements under UN supervision, supplementing Commission’s
                                resolution. It is this alternative to which Nehru gave unqualified

                                Pakistan.</p>

                                Delhi’s telegram no. 865 of September 20, 1948 regarding the
                                Governor-General’s remarks to me on the question of Hyderabad’s
                                appeal to the United Nations. There is enclosed a press despatch
                                from the Delhi <hi rend="italic">Statesman</hi> of September 24,
                                1948 which in the Embassy’s opinion offers an excellent analysis of
                                the military fiasco staged by the Hyderabad Army when <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> troops entered the State. The
                                Department is also referred in this connection to New Delhi’s
                                telegram no. 872 of September 24<note n="1" xml:id="d324fn1">Not
                                    printed.</note> in which the Nizam stated in a broadcast on
                                September 23 that he was helpless in the hands of the Razakars and
                                the Laik Ali Ministry.</p>
                            <p>The political commentator who prepared the enclosed press despatch
                                inquires why the Nizam’s Government, in apparent disregard of the
                                superior power of the Indian Army, saw fit to offer resistance,
                                India had in the field an armored division comprised of a massed
                                force of armored, motorized infantry, paratroops and the necessary
                                auxiliary services, in addition to infantry and artillery units.
                                Against this well-trained and equipped force the Nizam’s Army and
                                Razakar irregular’s, although more than five times in number, had
                                practically no armor, less experience and leadership, limited
                                ammunition and arms, and no air force. The fantastic stories
                                circulating around India regarding Hyderabad bombers in the State,
                                in Pakistan, and in Goa were never credited by the Embassy.</p>
                            <p>According to the enclosed press despatch, there were two basic
                                reasons for the Nizam’s Government offering no resistance. First,
                                although he never hoped for a decisive military success, the Nizam’s
                                Government gambled until the last minute against the chances of
                                India taking precipitate armed action. The Razakars and the Laik Ali
                                    <pb n="404" xml:id="pg_404" facs="0418"/>Ministry counted on the
                                possibility of outside help, both military and political, and on the
                                effect of world opinion as expressed through the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>The second reason for Hyderabad offering no resistance to India’s
                                overwhelming strength is that the Nizam expected, by means of a
                                military clash with a superior opponent, to get rid of the
                                Frankenstein he had created in the form of the Razakars. As it
                                turned out, the Nizam was right and the Laik Ali Ministry wrong. The
                                State is now able to liquidate military Fascism with the help of the
                                Indian Army but the Nizam will probably continue as ruler of the
                                State with his powers circumscribed in the same manner as the other
                                Indian princes. The Embassy considers the foregoing explanation of
                                Hyderabad’s token resistance as entirely correct. The method adopted
                                by the Nizam was the easiest and in fact the only way of getting rid
                                of the Razakars without a terrific toll of lives and serious civil
                                disturbances. The Embassy also believes, although this belief will
                                probably never be substantiated by any tangible evidence, that high
                                ranking officers of the Indian Army who were friends of General
                                El-Edroos, Commander-in-Chief of the Hyderabad Army, made a deal
                                with him (El-Edroos) whereby the Hyderabad Army would not fight.
                                General Bucher himself told me some weeks ago that he had written to
                                El-Edroos advising him not to be so foolish as to resist the Indian
                                Army. High ranking Indian officers who were also personal friends of
                                El-Edroos were also in touch with him. Saadat Ali Khan, son of Nawab
                                Zain Yar Jung, former Hyderabad Agent-General at New Delhi, told me
                                in August that there was bad blood between the Hyderabad Army and
                                Police on the one hand and the Razakars on the other. He also said,
                                however, that it was a question of just how far the Army and Police
                                would go in putting down the Razakars because all three
                                organizations were almost exclusively Muslim.</p>
                            <p>There is no doubt that the Nizam’s Government lost control of the
                                civil administration in certain, areas adjoining Madras Province and
                                that the Communists were having a “field day” in those areas. The
                                Embassy feels that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> action in
                                entering Hyderabad was the only possible remedy for an impossible
                                situation and that it was the only way India could deal effectively
                                with such a trickster as the Nizam. The Embassy has come to the
                                conclusion that the question of a plebiscite in Hyderabad is
                                immaterial since the result would be a foregone conclusion. The
                                Embassy also believes that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                will exercise tolerance and discretion in dealing with the Nizam and
                                the Muslim ruling clique in Hyderabad despite the fact that there is
                                a great deal of pressure on the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                to break up the State, to depose the Nizam, etc.</p>
                            <pb n="405" xml:id="pg_405" facs="0419"/>
                            <p>Finally, the Embassy believes that American prestige and interests in
                                India would be seriously damaged by the United States taking up the
                                cudgels over the question of a plebiscite in Hyderabad. If the
                                plebiscite would serve any useful purpose then such action might be
                                justified on our part but as the situation exists today, the Embassy
                                believes it would be a useless gesture which would only tend to
                                impair relations between India and the United States. In other
                                words, the Embassy believes that from now on the less said by our
                                Government the better so far as the Hyderabad question is
                                concerned.</p>

                                “upon presentation of the resolution (of August 13) the Commission
                                requested the Governments <pb n="406" xml:id="pg_406" facs="0420"
                                />of Pakistan and India to consider and accept this document as a
                                whole. It was intended that the details for the implementation of
                                the Resolution be discussed at common meetings between the
                                representatives of both Governments and the Commission in subsequent
                                stages, and following the cessation of hostilities.” The Chairman’s
                                letter then continues:</p>
                            <p>“The Commission observes with regret that the Government of Pakistan
                                has been unable to accept the Resolution without attaching certain
                                conditions beyond the compass of this Resolution, thereby making
                                impossible an immediate cease fire and the beginning of fruitful
                                negotiations between the two Governments and the Commission to bring
                                about a peaceful and final settlement of the situation hi the State
                                of Jammu and Kashmir.”</p>
                            <p>The letter then concludes with the statement that the Commission
                                sincerely hopes that the Government of Pakistan “may find it
                                possible to reconsider their position and to accept the proposals
                                contained in its Resolution of August 13, 1948, as clarified and
                                elucidated in the present letter and the correspondence mentioned
                                therein.”</p>
                            <p>Inasmuch as the Commission seems clearly to have placed the onus for
                                the non-acceptance of the Commission’s resolution of August 13 upon
                                Pakistan it is perhaps desirable that certain features of the
                                situation be carefully analyzed with a view to determining whether
                                that onus has in fact been well placed.</p>

                                        Commission’s resolution our most earnest thought. There are
                                        many parts of it which we should have preferred to be
                                        otherwise and more in keeping with the fundamental facts of
                                        the situation, especially the flagrant aggression of the
                                        Pakistan Government on Indian Union territory. We recognise,

                                Government of Pakistan, an extremely important reservation. In that
                                letter Pandit Nehru, referring to the “sparsely populated and
                                mountainous region of Jammu and Kashmir State in the North,” said
                                that the authority of the government of Jammu and Kashmir over that
                                region as a whole had not been challenged or disturbed “except by
                                roving bands of hostiles, or in some places like Skardu which have
                                been occupied by irregulars or Pakistan troops.” Pandit Nehru then
                                went on to say that the Commission’s Resolution, “as you agreed in
                                the course of our interview on the 18th, does not deal with the
                                problem of administration or defence in this large area. We desire
                                that, after Pakistan troops and irregulars have withdrawn from the
                                territory, the responsibility for the administration of the
                                evacuated areas should revert to the Government of Jammu and Kashmir
                                and that for defence to us. (The only exception that we should be
                                prepared to accept would be Gilgit.)”</p>
                            <p>Briefly, the salient features of the Commission’s cease fire and
                                truce proposals were that the governments of India and Pakistan
                                would issue separately and simultaneously a cease fire order to
                                apply to all forces under their control in the State of Jammu and
                                Kashmir, that the Commanders-in-Chief of the forces of India and
                                Pakistan should promptly confer regarding any necessary local
                                changes in present dispositions which might facilitate a cease fire,
                                that simultaneously with the acceptance of the proposal for the
                                immediate cessation of hostilities the Government of Pakistan would
                                withdraw its troops from the State of Jammu and Kashmir, that the
                                Government of Pakistan would use its best endeavor to secure the
                                withdrawal from the State of Jammu and Kashmir of tribesmen and
                                Pakistan nationals not <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0423"
                                />normally resident therein, and that pending a final resolution the
                                territory evacuated by the Pakistan troops would be administered by
                                the local authorities under the surveillance of the Commission.
                                Nowhere in the Resolution is authorization given to the Government
                                of India to advance its forces into areas occupied either by
                                Pakistan troops or by irregular forces. By whatever name called the
                                Government of Pakistan and the Azad Kashmir authorities regard the
                                forces in northern Kashmir as organized forces under the Azad
                                Kashmir authorities. Nevertheless Pandit Nehru in his letter
                                insisted that the Government of India should be permitted to
                                reoccupy a very large part of northern Kashmir now admittedly held
                                by non-Indian forces. His position was that permission for Indian
                                troops to occupy or reoccupy those areas was a further condition or
                                “consideration” precedent to his acceptance of the Resolution yet
                                the Commission did not consider the condition as a reservation. This
                                is confirmed by the Commission’s letter of August 25 to Pandit Nehru
                                in which it stated with reference to this question: “The Commission
                                wishes me to confirm that, due to the peculiar conditions of this
                                area, it did not specifically deal with the military aspect of the
                                problem in its Resolution of 13 August 1948. It believes, however,
                                that the question raised in your letter could be considered in the
                                implementation of the Resolution.” The phraseology used in the
                                latter sentence is not exactly clear, but the Government of Pakistan
                                understood it to mean an acceptance of Pandit Nehru’s position,
                                never denied by the Commission, and Pandit Nehru certainly accepted
                                the Commission’s letter as a confirmation of his position on that
                                point.</p>
                            <p>If, therefore, in the light of the documents on the subject, the
                                Government of Pakistan did not accept the Commission’s Resolution
                                “as a whole” can it be logically said that the Government of India
                                did accept it as a whole? The difference, of course, is that the
                                Commission accepted Pandit Nehru’s interpretations but did not
                                accept Sir Zafrullah’s, holding that his “were beyond the compass”
                                of the Resolution.</p>
                            <p>Whatever may have been the intentions of the Commission the onus of
                                rejecting its Resolution has thus been placed on Pakistan while
                                India is permitted to pass before world opinion as in effect an
                                aggrieved and injured party, which has accepted without reservation
                                the Commission’s Resolution. The Pakistanis feel, with due deference
                                to the Commission, that what in effect seems to have happened,
                                although the Commission may not be conscious of it and would resent
                                the implication, is that the Commission has been unable, as stated
                                by <hi rend="italic">Dawn</hi> in an editorial in its issue of
                                September 24 “to persuade Pakistan to surrender to the will of India
                                to whom the Commission most <pb n="410" xml:id="pg_410" facs="0424"
                                />inadvisedly and against the specific terms of the Security Council
                                Resolution of April 21, itself surrendered.”</p>
                            <p>The observations in this despatch reflect the authentic views of the
                                Government of Pakistan and yet throughout this period when the tide
                                of the Commission’s opinion has steadily and obviously been running
                                against Pakistan the Government of this country and the press have
                                borne, and still bear, themselves with dignity and without any signs
                                of malice. This is perhaps all the more remarkable in that it has
                                not escaped them that the question has recently become a matter of
                                far more importance than the mere question of the settlement of the
                                Kashmir dispute, for if world opinion is to gain the impression that
                                Pakistan has been the guilty and obstructive party that impression
                                would inevitably, and perhaps disastrously, affect the very
                                existence of Pakistan should India avail itself of the presence of
                                Pakistan troops in Kashmir, or avail itself of any other excuse, for
                                waging war on this country. India’s press has always been far more
                                effective than has the press of Pakistan. In the final analysis,
                                therefore, should India have aspirations in the direction indicated,
                                Pakistan would be functioning not alone at tremendous odds in terms
                                of military potential but also in terms of world opinion. One has
                                only to read the article in the September 20 issue of <hi
                                    rend="italic">Time</hi> entitled “Pakistan. That Man”, and
                                particularly the last paragraph, to grasp the significance of this
                                observation.</p>
                            <p>It is accordingly vital to Pakistan that its position in relation to
                                the Kashmir dispute and to the Commission’s Resolution be
                                objectively stated and objectively understood and that the same
                                should be done with reference to India’s position in these matters.
                                There may never be agreement, but there is no need for either party
                                to suffer the injustice of misrepresentation.</p>
                            <p>I know that most, if not all, of the members of the Commission
                                believe that Kashmir, or most of it, should logically fall to
                                Pakistan, but I also know that they are extremely annoyed with
                                Pakistan for not having bowed to their judgment in the matter of the
                                approach to the settlement of the problem and thereby having made
                                the Commission’s efforts to achieve a settlement infructuous.
                                Entirely apart from questions of principle, little or no
                                consideration was given by the Commission to the practical reasons,
                                to which I referred in my despatch of September 10, why Pakistan
                                could not bow to the Commission’s judgment. Had the Commission bowed
                                less to India’s intransigence on the plebiscite issue those
                                practical reasons would largely have disappeared and with them the
                                questions of principle which troubled Pakistan.</p>

                                views expressed in this editorial are shared by the Embassy. There
                                is no question but that the Nizam, surrounded by a small minority of
                                Muslim extremists, was a menace to the peace and security of India.
                                The question whether Hyderabad was an independent state can no doubt
                                be argued for hours but the blunt facts are that India could not
                                permit a hostile government to function within its borders.</p>
                            <p>The Embassy cannot too strongly emphasize that American interests in
                                India would best be served by considering the Hyderabad question as
                                closed.</p>

                            <p>483. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, now on tour in northern
                                Pakistan, has just sent me through Minister Foreign Affairs text
                                telegram from Nehru dated September 27<note n="1" xml:id="d329fn1"
                                    >Copy transmitted to the Department by the Chargé in his

                                    printed.</note> in which Nehru states that since India Pakistan
                                Commission has confirmed presence Pakistan troops in Kashmir and
                                Jammu, which confirms <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>’s
                                information, presence of Pakistan troops on Indian Union territory
                                is “an act of aggression against Indian Union and can only lead to
                                conflict.” Nehru then says: “I must therefore ask you to withdraw
                                these troops. You have expressed your desire to maintain and develop
                                peaceful and cooperative relations with India. We entirely agree
                                with this. We have absolutely no wish to interfere in any way with
                                Pakistan. You will appreciate, however, that development of peaceful
                                and cooperative relations cannot take place while army of Pakistan
                                continues an act of <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0429"
                                />aggression against India. Hence I would request you to take early
                                steps to withdraw all Pakistan troops from Jammu and Kashmir
                                state.”</p>
                            <p>Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan asked me to call to see him evening
                                prior his departure September 25 for Lahore. Told me he was very
                                apprehensive India with its easy conquest of Junagadh, Hyderabad and
                                present position in Kashmir would very soon seek an excuse for
                                waging war on Pakistan and that he apprehended presence Pakistan
                                troops Kashmir would be utilized that purpose although if necessary
                                other reasons to justify aggression would be advanced. He expressed
                                hope I would keep <gloss target="#t_USG1">USG</gloss> informed any
                                developments above direction and hoped <gloss target="#t_USG1"
                                    >USG</gloss> along with other powers interested suppression
                                aggression and maintenance peace in world would take appropriate
                                action protect Pakistan from Indian aggression if latter should
                                develop. Said he was “no fool” to attack India or to provoke an
                                Indian attack but that if India did attack Pakistan will resist with
                                all its resources. Ghulam Mohammad, Minister of Finance, spoke to me
                                along similar lines September 27 and Ikramullah, Secretary Minister
                                Foreign Affairs, has likewise done so. None these officials have
                                advanced threat that if we do not help Pakistan <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOP1">GOP</gloss> will turn to Russia. Argument for
                                outside help in protecting Pakistan based solely on right of nation
                                to exist.</p>
                            <p>Telegram from Nehru is precisely in line with pattern anticipated by
                                this Embassy including Military Attaché and if Department is
                                interested continued existence Pakistan, as I believe it is for

                                informally at Lauterpacht, Hyderabad legal adviser, at his request.
                                Keynote of talk was our frank observation at outset that we had no
                                encouragement to offer him and warning that most likely practical
                                result of further discussion in <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                now would be action to drop case from agenda. However he made strong
                                appeals for appointment of UN subcommittee and despatch of observers
                                or alternatively US mediation to revive Indian proposals of June
                                1948. We told him first suggestion unrealistic in view of <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> preoccupation with Berlin issue and
                                prior lengthy discussion necessary to settle question of Hyderabad
                                status and <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> competence in case. On
                                second suggestion we merely said we would let him know if we could
                                offer any encouragement. Result of meeting was obvious realization
                                by Lauterpacht that our attitude is passive and assumption by him
                                that we do not accept view that Hyderabad is a state.</p>

                                        and cooperative relations with Pakistan, you have in your
                                        telegram under reply threatened Pakistan with war. This is
                                        hardly the way to promote peaceful and cooperative relations
                                        between two countries. I must make it clear that the
                                        Pakistan Government cannot allow themselves to be
                                        intimidated by a threat of the use of force by your
                                        government. Such a threat is a violation of the Charter of
                                        the United Nations and is a serious challenge to the
                                        authority of the Security Council which is seized of the
                                        Kashmir dispute. Moreover, this threat is in complete
                                        disregard of the UN Commission’s resolution of 19 September
                                        in which the Commission appealed to the Government of India
                                        and Pakistan to use their best endeavors during the absence
                                        of the Commission to lessen the existing tension in Kashmir
                                        dispute. Consequently, I have felt it my duty to bring your
                                        telegram and my reply to the notice of the chairman of the

                                <item>While acute apprehension exists in Pakistan regarding <gloss

                                    military aggression in Kashmir. However, Patrick said as he saw
                                    situation in Paris, and on basis other information he could not
                                    believe there is much risk <gloss target="#t_GOP1"
                                        >GOP</gloss>–<gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> war at the
                                    moment. For example, Indian and Pakistan general headquarters
                                    are still in daily telephonic communication. Patrick believes
                                    both sides sincerely would like to have out-of-court settlement
                                    and that both sides recognize that sooner or later each will
                                    have to make concessions. Immediate question to be decided,
                                    Patrick said, is whether publication Kashmir Commission report
                                    would help or hinder out-of-court settlement. Patrick said view
                                        <gloss target="#t_CRO1">CRO</gloss> is that if two sides
                                    could get together on a settlement it might be better for
                                    Kashmir Commission report never to be made public even though it
                                    is as even-handed as Department suggests (paragraph 5,
                                    Department’s 3814 September 29 to London sent Geneva for Kashmir

                                        <item>“1. We understand that the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1"
                                                >UNCIP</gloss> have now arrived at Geneva to write
                                            an interim report. Since this report will then come
                                            before the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> we are
                                            anxious to obtain some advance indication of:—(<hi

                                            which the commission contemplate including in it. Owing
                                            to our lack of contact with the commission we have no
                                            direct source of information.</item>
                                        <item>2. In view of the present deadlock it seems important
                                            that the report should contain some constructive
                                            indications of the lines of which the commission
                                            themselves would propose to make further progress.
                                            Otherwise we fear that the whole question will be thrown
                                            back upon the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> with a
                                            repetition of the debates which preceded the resolution
                                            of 21 April.</item>
                                        <item>3. As regards the timetable we are particularly
                                            anxious to know whether the report will be available
                                            before or during the meeting of Commonwealth Prime
                                            Ministers in London when there may conceivably be an
                                            opportunity for some talk with the Indian and Pakistan
                                            representatives on Kashmir. Such discussions, if
                                            practicable, might be useful, without of course, in any
                                            way affecting the functions of the <gloss
                                                target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> or its commission. Pandit
                                            Nehru will be here from about 6th to 25th October. We
                                            hope that Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan will also be here and if
                                            he cannot come owing to the responsibilities falling on
                                            him consequent of Mr. Jinnah’s death, Sir M. Zafrullah
                                            Khan will take his place.</item>
                                        <item>4. We understand that the commission may be thinking
                                            in terms of partition. We have hitherto believed that it
                                            would be a mistake for the <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                                >SC</gloss> to abandon the relatively firm ground of
                                            the proposal to have a plebiscite which has been
                                            accepted in principle by both sides and which is
                                            enshrined in the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>’s
                                            resolution of 21 April, unless there is really solid
                                            reason to think that India and Pakistan are ready to
                                            agree on some alternative arrangement and one which
                                            promises to provide permanent solution. We still think
                                            that to abandon the agreed principle of a fair
                                            plebiscite would be a most dangerous proceeding, unless
                                            both sides are really agreed. On the other hand, we are
                                            conscious that a plebiscite covering the whole state
                                            would involve considerable administrative difficulties
                                            and is open to the objection that, if the fate of the
                                            whole state of Kashmir and Jammu is decided by
                                            plebiscite as a single unit, either south-eastern
                                            districts with a Hindu majority might go to Pakistan or
                                            Poonch and Gilgit etc, might go to India. Our
                                            information suggests that India might now be ready to
                                            consider partition, although Pakistan appears to be
                                            increasingly confident that a genuinely fair plebiscite
                                            covering the whole state would go in their
                                            favour.</item>
                                        <item>5. In these circumstances, we would see some advantage
                                            in the commission mentioning partition in their report
                                            as a possible solution. But <pb n="425" xml:id="pg_425"
                                                facs="0439"/>since straightforward partition does
                                            not seem politically practicable this suggestion could
                                            therefore best take the form of proposal that: <list>

                                                  21 April should be held in remainder of

                                            <lb/>It seems essential to keep this resolution in the
                                            foreground in this way, since it has the authority of
                                            the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> and lays down
                                            minimum conditions for the conduct of a fair plebiscite.
                                            It also seems of great importance that the commission
                                            should not attempt to define at this stage the areas
                                            which under any partition should go to either India or
                                            Pakistan, because this would make it difficult for
                                            either side subsequently to accept less.</item>
                                        <item>6. It is important that, if partition is to be
                                            discussed, the initiative should come from the
                                            commission. Any chance of progress would be seriously
                                            prejudiced if the Indians and Pakistanis believed that
                                            the UK Government had taken steps to promote a solution
                                            of these lines.”</item>

                            <p>Material information requested by Department mostly contained
                                Huddle’s October 11 No. 265 to Paris repeated Department 1374
                                October 11. The Commission is working with regularity on report
                                which will be completed ready for Commission in interim phase.
                                Commission does not regard report as final and expects either to be
                                able to take some positive action on its own initiative at later
                                date or as result further consideration by <gloss target="#t_SC1"
                                    >SC</gloss> which might possibly find it possible issue
                                instructions depending on developments.</p>
                            <p>Commission considers that Indo-Pakistan troubles are such as could
                                best be solved by negotiations India and Pakistan but believes its
                                services might be useful in ultimate solution Kashmir problem since
                                notwithstanding original coolness both governments, Commission did
                                succeed in winning certain amount confidence both Karachi and Delhi
                                in its explorations Kashmir problem.</p>
                            <p>Consequently if, in conversations with General Marshall Paris and
                                Prime Minister Attlee at London, Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan could be
                                prevailed upon to agree to general plebiscite in Jammu-Kashmir to be
                                held under control of UN agency, I believe Commission could
                                appropriately <pb n="429" xml:id="pg_429" facs="0443"/>assume task

                                resolution would naturally have full powers for administrative
                                tasks, but should be agent of Commission rather than of Secretary
                                General of UN. This however is speculative and it seems that no
                                steps can be taken with any certainty until temper of India and
                                Pakistan Prime Minister has been ascertained in London and
                                Paris.</p>
                            <p>Commission is desirous of having benefit of independent and hitherto
                                unprejudiced appraisal of Pakistan and India attitudes to support or
                                correct its own convictions and is awaiting with grave interest

                            <p>Would prefer not speculate relative desirability <gloss

                            <p>Have forwarded by airmail complete text Nehru’s telegram replying to
                                Liaquat Ali Khan’s telegram of October 3 (Karachi 483). In his
                                reply, Nehru said his telegram of September 27 “was designed explore

                                and Pakistan. It will be recalled that Nehru had given negative

                                    that is impossible. We have based all our actions on a policy to
                                    get a cease-fire, as you well know, and we continue to attach
                                    the utmost importance to this. The first attitude of India was a
                                    plebiscite and they proposed that the United Nations should
                                    undertake it and Pakistan agreed to this proposition. Now the
                                    next thing both parties agreed was that the plebiscite should be
                                    fair. If they are both agreed on this, they ought to be able to
                                    agree on what is a fair plebiscite, and therefore there ought
                                    not to be any substance to divide the parties, and certainly
                                    nothing which anybody could feel is worth while to run the risk
                                    of war.</p>
                                <p>4. The best solution would be if India and Pakistan could agree
                                    and jointly announce to the UN in Paris that agreement had been
                                    reached. This would give them a great moral ascendancy and if
                                    you could emphasize to Nehru the tremendous effect it would have
                                    on the course of events in Asia and the whole world, and if he
                                    would accept that, this would be a great achievement.</p>
                                <p>5. Both India and Pakistan must appreciate that they are faced
                                    with the risk of the Russian menace and if they would make a
                                    supreme effort to settle their differences it would make a great
                                    contribution to peace.</p>
                                <p>6. It might be that one or other parties, or both, might have
                                    proposals for accelerating a decision, and if they could reveal
                                    what is in their mind, and put it forward quickly, it would
                                    help.”</p>

                                    <p>“I am grateful for your message of the fifteenth which duly
                                        reached me before Nehru called. As you know, I left for
                                        Greece and Italy thereafter and have only just returned.</p>
                                    <p>Nehru and I had a very long general talk during which he
                                        seemed primarily interested in having my views on the world
                                        situation and, most particularly, on Russian objectives. It
                                        was, as you anticipated, quite informal but even with the
                                        help which your message gave me I found him most sensitive
                                        on the subject of Kashmir. Although I touched on this matter
                                        only in passing and continued talking on other matters for
                                        some time, he found it difficult when his turn came to talk
                                        about Kashmir in a moderate way. The following from my notes
                                        of the conversation will give you the line he took:</p>
                                    <p>Nehru remarked that as I had mentioned Kashmir, he wished to
                                        say that he felt he had a real grievance there. If he felt
                                        for a moment that legally, morally or practically, India did
                                        not have a just case, he would at once recede from his
                                        position. However, on none of these counts was there any
                                        merit in Pakistan’s case. India had accepted the Kashmir
                                        Commission’s resolution, whereas Pakistan had rejected it.
                                        Kashmir was Indian territory by virtue of its legal
                                        accession to the Indian union, it was a center of Indian
                                        culture in arts and crafts, contained much wealth that it
                                        owed to the capacity of Indian elements in its people who
                                        were far superior to the others. As a frontier province it
                                        was threatened by tribesmen who had laid waste many of its
                                        towns, aided by gangsters from Pakistan. No Indian
                                        government could have remained in power for a week had it
                                        not risen to the defense of Indian territory by flying in
                                        the few hundreds of troops which saved Srinagar.
                                        Unfortunately this local action had, bit by bit, led to
                                        greater complications and now he acknowledged it was a
                                        serious situation.</p>
                                    <p>Nehru then launched into a recital of the contrast between
                                        the democratic and secular character of India, and the
                                        backward and theocratic nature of Pakistan. India wished to
                                        develop a country wherein all elements of the population
                                        could share, whereas in Pakistan the underlying idea was the
                                        advancement of the most bigoted group of Moslems. Nehru said
                                        that these people were unreasonable extremists, and had even
                                        had the effrontery to state that after conquering Kashmir
                                        they would march on New Delhi. As another illustration of
                                        their character, he spoke of a young Moslem doctor who was
                                        stoned to death in Lahore because he dared to defend his
                                        wife for having defied old fashioned custom. There was even
                                        a growing movement for the restoration of the old eighth
                                        century law of the Koran.</p>
                                    <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0446"/>
                                    <p>I did not comment on the foregoing. I rather suspect that
                                        Nehru felt he may have overdone it. At any rate he came back
                                        to Kashmir briefly just before we finished and in a more
                                        conciliatory vein as the following further quotation will
                                        indicate:</p>
                                    <p>Late in the conversation, Nehru reverted to Kashmir in a much
                                        more moderate vein. He said that he was very conscious of
                                        this problem, was sincerely desirous of having it settled,
                                        and he hoped that some solution could be worked out. He also
                                        alluded to the Hyderabad incident briefly, saying that in
                                        India in recent weeks there had been a marked improvement in
                                        the internal situation. This was in large measure due to the
                                        settlement of the Hyderabad incident. This crisis and the
                                        restraint of both elements of the population at that time
                                        had removed a source of much anxiety and distrust.</p>
                                    <p>There was one other reaction which you may find interesting.
                                        I took some care to outline our support of the UN and our
                                        hopes for its future, and was quite gratified at the
                                        response. Although Nehru made it clear that India had had
                                        disappointments in matters of interest to it, he did not
                                        labor the point. On the contrary, he said that India would
                                        support the UN despite its weaknesses since it was the only
                                        hope of the world, and therefore could not be abandoned. He
                                        also said that while it might sound trite, he completely
                                        agreed with me in condemning deceit and force in
                                        international affairs.</p>
                                    <p>I hope the foregoing will be of some value to you and that
                                        with the congenial atmosphere which has been created in
                                        London you can bring the two men to talk together on this
                                        subject. There was nothing in my conversation with Nehru
                                        which suggested any better approach to him than your line of
                                        the great moral ascendancy and the impression of
                                        statesmanship which would result if he and Liaquat were able
                                        to settle this problem of such moment to Asia and the world.
                                        It would surprise me very much if our talk did not add to
                                        his appreciation of the Russian menace.”</p>

                                against the idea of a plebiscite but was unwilling to commit himself
                                as to its terms. On the other hand he felt that the Pakistan
                                representatives were being much more reasonable in this matter, but
                                that Nehru since he was a Kashmir Hindu was very emotional and
                                intransigent on this subject. He said he felt that the main issue
                                was who would control the main artery leading into central Asia. The
                                Indian proposals would leave that in their hands and this was
                                something that Pakistan found difficult to accept. He very much
                                feared that next spring the Indians, encouraged by the success of
                                their operation against Hyderabad, would start fighting in Kashmir
                                in the spring and that this might open up considerable possibilities
                                to the Russians to exploit the situation in order to obtain a
                                foothold in northern India. He promised to let the Secretary know
                                the result of his conversation with Nehru this morning.</p>
                            <p>The Secretary told Mr. Bevin that it had been suggested from
                                Washington that he see Nehru again but that he was not entirely
                                convinced that it would be wise for him to give the appearance of
                                pressing Nehru on this matter.</p>

                                <item>Secretary and Liaquat Ali Khan held one hour and half
                                    conversation yesterday. Zafrullah Khan also present. Numerous
                                    subjects covered. Liaquat spoke in most frank and open manner.
                                    Although he showed no trace bitterness he seemed to give
                                    impression that he thought United States was ignoring Middle
                                    Eastern (Moslem) area while giving much attention to West
                                    Europe.</item>

                                <item>After exchange pleasantries, Liaquat commenced conversation by
                                    saying he wished besides having opportunity to meet Secretary to
                                    discuss strategic position Pakistan in <gloss target="#t_ME1"
                                        >ME</gloss> and world. He reviewed great difficulties
                                    Pakistan has encountered in becoming established, citing vast
                                    refugee problem, economic difficulties and relations with India
                                    particularly on Kashmir. He declared it unthinkable that
                                    Pakistan could fall prey to Communism since (1) latter was
                                    contrary to tenets Moslem religion in respect democratic ideals,
                                    property ownership and individual’s position; (2) states outside
                                    Communist orbit should fully know Communist ideology was
                                    oppressive in extreme. Pakistan was anxious to maintain stand
                                    against Communist infiltration. Liaquat then said frankly that
                                    since United States was strongest most powerful nation among
                                    free nations it should assist other nations to strengthen
                                    themselves. He referred to assistance United States was giving
                                    to Western Europe. While understanding necessity for <gloss

                                    should strengthen Middle Eastern area economically and
                                    militarily.</item>

                                <item>Turning to India-Pakistan relations Liaquat termed India’s
                                    attitude toward Pakistan as hostile. He said Kashmir question
                                    could be easily settled by plebiscite. However, there must be no
                                    coercive forces present during plebiscite. Pakistan had been
                                    struggling to obtain peaceful settlement but if India persisted
                                    in aggressive role Pakistan would fight in face
                                    aggression.</item>

                                    explaining how West Europe has been commercial nerve center of
                                    world. It was dangerously close to collapse a year ago. With
                                    revival of European economy world would benefit. Secretary said
                                    United States resources were limited and we could not as a
                                    government undertake commitments beyond our abilities. Secretary
                                    explained in some detail role of Congress and its committees in
                                    granting aid and loans. Then said there was vast <pb n="436"

                                    assurances as to security of investment. Secretary also referred
                                    to Export-Import Bank.</item>

                                <item>Regarding Communism and USSR policy, Secretary pointed out
                                    that his concern was primarily directed at development and
                                    spread of police state. He was glad to know of Pakistan’s
                                    attitude regarding this matter. He said that one very important
                                    way by which states outside police state orbit could strengthen
                                    themselves would be to settle all of their major differences
                                    quickly and peacefully. In this connection he expressed hope
                                    Kashmir question would be settled in conformity with UN
                                    principles. He remarked that United States had not been able to
                                    ship arms to India or Pakistan while Kashmir question was point
                                    of friction. Secretary also said it was most important to obtain
                                    settlement Palestine question and concluded that we are vitally
                                    interested in stability of Near East and remaining portions of
                                    world. In saying this, Secretary emphasized necessity for all
                                    nations supporting UN which was only real hope for peace.</item>

                                <item>Liaquat said Pakistan was in a position vis-à-vis India where
                                    an arms embargo favored India and harmed Pakistan since India
                                    had all the ordnance factories and Pakistan had few supplies. He
                                    again repeated that he thought United States should do all it
                                    could to strengthen Near East area. He said he was in complete
                                    agreement that Palestine question had to be settled and he also
                                    agreed with Secretary that UN must have support of all the
                                    nations. Secretary pointed out to Liaquat that we are already
                                    helping Near Eastern area through our aid to Greece, Turkey and
                                    Iran. There was a limit to what we could do but we were deeply
                                    interested in the development of Near Eastern countries and we
                                    hoped that the time would come when projects presently in
                                    planning stage could become reality.</item>

                                <item>Liaquat seemed quite pleased with Secretary’s frank approach.
                                    Zafrullah Khan said after Secretary and Liaquat had departed
                                    that he thought meeting had gone quite well. Zafrullah then told
                                    me in strictest confidence that Pakistan is seriously
                                    considering bringing to <gloss target="#t_ICJ1">ICJ</gloss> the

                                    rivers vital to the economy of the West Punjab. Pakistan has
                                    already commenced collecting the basic data after efforts to
                                    settle the question bilaterally were unsuccessful and India had
                                    rejected suggestion for arbitration.</item>

                                    recommending revised <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                    recommendations to the parties. It is possible that at this

                                    <item>The first part of the report will be in our hands
                                        momentarily. We shall be glad to make a copy available as
                                        soon as it is received. Its submission to the <gloss
                                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> can probably be arranged for
                                        a time that will harmonize with any pending efforts for
                                        settlement of the dispute. We would hope that the first part
                                        may still be modified if after consultation with the UK such
                                        modification appear important.</item>

                                    <item>We understand that the commission is planning to meet in
                                        Paris for conferences and to consider conclusions on
                                        November 1. At the suggestion of the <gloss target="#t_SYG1"
                                            >SYG</gloss> and of the US member of the Commission an
                                        informal meeting planned for October 28 in Paris has been
                                        abandoned. We are urging that the Commission remain in
                                        Geneva, and that ample time be allowed for the consideration
                                        of both parts of the report by US in consultation with the

                                    <item>We believe that the second part of the report might well
                                        contain constructive recommendations based on the principles
                                        of the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> resolution of April
                                        21, 1948. According to our information, the first part as
                                        now drafted will be largely historical in approach. The
                                        present thinking in the Commission is that it should contain
                                        no conclusions or recommendations, except perhaps the
                                        expression of the hope that the parties can be induced to
                                        agree on a plebiscite under Part Three of August 13 of the
                                        resolution and to accept the cease-fire and truce
                                        provisions. On this theory, the Commission would expect its
                                        conclusions to be added later in the second part. These
                                        conclusions would recommend affirmative action either on the
                                        Commission’s initiative or possibly suggest further <gloss
                                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action as the basis for such
                                        recommendations. It is our hope that the content of the
                                        report will not be such as to call for <gloss
                                            target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action but can be regarded by
                                        the Council merely as an interim report of the Commission’s
                                        progress. This is a point on which we and the UK may wish to
                                        confer.</item>

                                    <item>Looking now to the possibility of combining the principle
                                        of a plebiscite with partition of certain areas of Jammu and
                                        Kashmir, we have for some time considered that such a
                                        formula is worthy of careful consideration. For reasons that
                                        are obvious we have, however, been disinclined to take the
                                        initiative on the point.</item>
                                    <label>5.</label>
                                    <item>Our information is that the interim report as now being
                                        drafted will not discuss partition which has not been
                                        formally considered by the Commission. It found the idea
                                        unpopular especially with the Moslems <pb n="440"
                                            xml:id="pg_440" facs="0454"/>of both parties who feared
                                        that by any partition they would lose the Kashmir Valley.
                                        However, there is some indication that the members of the
                                        Commission are of the general opinion that a partition
                                        agreement has distinct administrative advantages, as opposed
                                        to a plebiscite, in certain areas.</item>

                                    <item>Before proceeding with the consideration of this question
                                        or taking any definite steps we would be interested in
                                        knowing the UK’s view on partition in general and whether
                                        the UK has in mind any particular plan as to a plebiscite
                                        and partition. If such is the case, we would like to discuss
                                        its details as a necessary prelude to the support of any
                                        general proposals which might arise in the Commission or the
                                            <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>. Also, we would
                                        appreciate any information as to whether the UK contemplates
                                        informal discussions with any other governments represented
                                        on the Commission as to the type of recommendations the
                                        Commission might make, but we would infer from Paragraph Six
                                        of the UK’s aide-mémoire that such discussions are not
                                        intended. We should also want to consider whether the
                                        initiative in suggesting partition might come from some
                                        delegation on the Commission other than our own.</item>

                                        general and particular aspects of this case with the UK and
                                        are mindful of its thinking that the initiative in
                                        discussing partition should come from, the

                            <p>[The first two paragraphs of this memorandum concern a luncheon
                                conversation of October 30 between Huddle and Zafrullah Khan
                                regarding water rights in three rivers that originate in
                                Jammu-Kashmir and flow through Pakistan before entering the
                                northeastern area of India.]</p>
                            <p>On Saturday evening, October 30th, I dined with Colonel Abdur Rahim
                                Khan of the Pakistan Delegation, and Minister Mohammed Ali the
                                Pakistan Chief of the Cabinet who accompanied the Prime Minister
                                Liaquat Ali Khan to London and Paris.</p>
                            <p>Mohammed Ali informed me that the London conversations which Prime
                                Minister Attlee arranged with Prime Ministers Nehru and Liaquat Ali
                                Khan were without constructive result insofar as the</p>
                            <p>
                                <pb n="441" xml:id="pg_441" facs="0455"/>Kashmir problem is
                                concerned. He said that when Prime Minister Attlee first raised the
                                question, Mr. Nehru was somewhat receptive to the idea of a
                                plebiscite which would be arranged as the Pakistani advocate. Later
                                however he seemed to change his position, and in the end had flatly
                                refused to agree with Pakistan demands in the plebiscite proposals.
                                Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan continuously expressed himself as favorable to
                                the plebiscite idea although he would not agree with a “district
                                plebiscite” or series of district plebiscites but insisted that an
                                overall or general plebiscite be held for the whole country. The
                                Pakistani objected to the district plebiscite because they feel that
                                displacement of population has occurred to such an extent that a
                                series of district plebiscites might have spotty results which would
                                be entirely unsatisfactory in the ultimate disposal of
                                Jammu-Kashmir. Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan expressed himself during the
                                conversation as being agreeable to any arrangement under neutral
                                control which would guarantee a fair result.</p>
                            <p>At one point in the conversations Mr. Attlee had asked about the
                                possibility of a military decision if matters went from bad to
                                worse. In response to this question Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan had said
                                that the Pakistani had no idea that they would be able to expel the
                                Indians from Jammu-Kashmir, but he said on the other hand that India
                                would never be able to drive the Pakistani out of Jammu-Kashmir.</p>
                            <p>The conversations ended therefore without anything in the nature of
                                an understanding for settlement.</p>
                            <p>Sir Stafford Cripps however had suggested a day or two ago that since
                                both Prime Ministers Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan were together in
                                Paris they should by all means make an effort to meet here for a
                                further conversation. Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan had said in reply to this
                                suggestion that he would be agreeable, and it was therefore arranged
                                that he would call on Mr. Nehru on Saturday evening, October 30th at
                                10 p. m. (I understand that Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan attended an early
                                evening reception given by Pandit Nehru and the Indian Delegation
                                and that the 10 o’clock appointment was filled thereafter.)</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mohammed Ali told me on Saturday evening that he would arrange to
                                let me know the results of the conversation of Nehru and Liaquat Ali
                                Khan as soon as possible, and since he thought he would have the
                                information in hand by Monday morning we arranged for an appointment
                                at 10:30 a. m. on Monday, November 1st prior to his departure on
                                Tuesday for Cairo and Karachi.</p>
                            <p>In my conversation with Mr. Mohammed Ali I found that his views have
                                not changed since my departure from Karachi, and they remain as
                                previously reported to the American Delegation and the
                                Department.</p>
                            <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0456"/>
                            <p>On Monday, November 1st, in our conversation at 10:30 o’clock, Mr.
                                Mohammed Ali reported to me that the talk between Prime Ministers
                                Liaquat Ali Khan and Nehru had no better results than their previous
                                conversations in London. Mr. Mohammed Ali said that Mr. Nehru had
                                proposed one of two methods of procedure to Mr. Liaquat Ali
                                Khan.</p>
                            <p>The first was that Pakistan accept without any conditions the
                                Resolution, taken by the United Nations Commission for India and
                                Pakistan on August 13, 1948.</p>
                            <p>The second, an alternative, would be that Pakistan accept a partition
                                of Jammu-Kashmir on the lines now existing, meaning the territory
                                occupied and controlled by the Azad Kashmiri and the Pakistani on
                                the one hand and the territory occupied and controlled by the
                                Indians and the local Sheikh Abdullah Government on the other.</p>
                            <p>Regarding the first Mr. Liaquat Ali Khan had replied to Mr. Nehru
                                that Pakistan had accepted the Commission’s Resolution, although it
                                had made a condition that India must accept the plebiscite terms of
                                the Resolution of the Security Council of April 21, 1948. Unless
                                India would accept those terms as applicable in working out the
                                future of Kashmir, Pakistan of course could not implement the Parts
                                I and II of the Resolution. Mr. Nehru would not go along with this
                                proposal of the Pakistan Prime Minister.</p>
                            <p>Insofar as the second proposition of Mr. Nehru was concerned, Prime
                                Minister Liaquat Ali Khan declined to give any consideration
                                whatsoever to the suggestion of partition, to say nothing of
                                partition on lines which exist at present.</p>
                            <p>(It seems clear that a stalemate exists between the two Governments
                                on the Kashmir question and that neither is willing to make
                                concessions which are obviously necessary if a peaceful settlement
                                is to be achieved).</p>
                            <p>Having thus briefly reviewed the conversation of the two Prime
                                Ministers, Mr. Mohammed Ali told me that the idea of partition seems
                                to be gaining some support in recent days. He says that the Indians
                                are apparently responsible for initiating a new consideration of
                                partition. In addition to members of the Indian Delegation whom he
                                thinks have been broaching the matter he met an old friend from
                                India, a former university professor of his, who suggested to him
                                that partition might well be undertaken.</p>
                            <p>When Mr. Mohammed Ali introduced the question it gave me a good
                                opportunity to discuss again with him the partition possibility.
                                Little or nothing had been said of partition during the later weeks
                                of the Commission’s presence in Pakistan but in our earlier days
                                there the question was raised from time to time. At that time Prime
                                Minister Liaquat Ali Khan told me in a manner not to be
                                misunderstood that <pb n="443" xml:id="pg_443" facs="0457"/>Pakistan
                                would not favor any splitting up of Jammu-Kashmir which would
                                deprive Pakistan of all or even any part of the Vale of Kashmir.
                                Even regarding the eastern corner of the State of Jammu which is now
                                probably 100% Indian, Liaquat Ali Khan said that he would take his
                                chances on a general plebiscite to cover the whole area and would
                                not think of giving up a claim to any of Jammu. Mr. Mohammed Ali
                                maintained the same position in this present conversation which his
                                chief had expressed last July. I mentioned several possible
                                divisions which might seem on their face to be equitable. I
                                suggested that southeastern Jammu wasn’t necessary to Pakistan
                                economy, that it was now denuded of Muslims, and that it appertained
                                naturally to India. I feel that the Pakistani would not be too
                                averse to the loss of this particular territory, but they do want
                                the whole of the Chenab Valley. My personal feeling is that the
                                Chenab should not be a boundary but in a division should go to
                                Pakistan. I also broached the possibility that the Vale of Kashmir
                                itself might be susceptible to division so that the southern part
                                might appertain to India and the northern part to Pakistan. The
                                southern part would include the district of Anantnag and the town of
                                Srinagar, while the northern part would include Baramulla and the
                                town of Baramulla. As stated above Pakistan might be willing that
                                India should have the extreme southeast of Jammu without too much
                                dispute, but Mr. Mohammed Ali flatly refused to consider any
                                division of the Vale of Kashmir.</p>
                            <p>These possible divisions presume, to be sure, that all of the
                                perimeter now in Pakistan hands should remain under Pakistan
                                jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>I finally asked Mr. Mohammed Ali whether his Government would be
                                disposed to consider any partition proposition with favor and he
                                said he thought it would be useless to present one.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the question of partition I am convinced that a
                                similar attitude will be found among the Indians. The similarity
                                lies in the fact that the Indians are equally insistent upon
                                obtaining the Vale of Kashmir and they would not accept any
                                partition of Jammu-Kashmir which did not award them the famous
                                Valley. The situation in this respect is no different from what it
                                has been in the past.</p>
                            <p>I took this opportunity to sound out Mr. Mohammed Ali on what
                                Pakistan might find agreeable in the recommendations and conclusions
                                of the Commission. He is explicit in answering that Pakistan now
                                favors a Resolution by the Security Council setting forth the
                                conditions under which a general plebiscite shall be held in
                                Jammu-Kashmir. He said if this is prescribed by the Security Council
                                along with the August 13, 1948 Resolution of the Commission,
                                Pakistan will be glad to comply in all respects such as the
                                withdrawal of its Army, etc. Beyond this, Mr. Mohammed Ali has no
                                constructive suggestions for solution of the problem.</p>
                            <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0458"/>
                            <p>I desire to note for future reference that I asked Mr. Mohammed Ali
                                how long he felt would be required to arrange for a plebiscite. In
                                reply he said that he thought if the conditions were laid down soon
                                that it still could be held within the coming year. This I mentioned
                                specifically because it conflicts with statements made by both
                                Sheikh Abdullah and Ghulam Abbas to members of the Commission,
                                including myself. These minor leaders insisted that anywhere between
                                three to five years would be required to restore conditions to such
                                an extent that a satisfactory plebiscite could be held.</p>
                            <p>I also asked Mohammed Ali to explain clearly to me what Mr. Liaquat
                                Ali Kahn, Sir Zafrullah Khan and he himself meant by “a neutral
                                government” to ensure a fair and equitable plebiscite. He said
                                “neutralized” might be a better term. They had in mind something
                                like a coalition government participated in on equal terms by the
                                present Azad Kashmir movement and the Sheikh Abdullah regime which
                                for these purposes would fuse. (Members of the Commission had
                                learned through informal conversations with Sheikh Abdullah and
                                Ghulam Abbas that they might not be adverse to forming a coalition
                                which might possibly be effective in this relation).</p>

                            <p>Sir Alexander opened the conversation by saying that he had been
                                instructed by his Government to convey to me its latest views with
                                respect to the Kashmir situation. He said that his Government had
                                decided, on the basis of recent information from the area, that the
                                    <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0460"/>Security Council
                                should, in the immediate future, issue an immediate and
                                unconditional cease fire order to the Governments of India and
                                Pakistan. Sir Alexander stated that the information reaching his
                                Government indicated: (1) That Indian and Pakistani troops were
                                lined up in close proximity and that there was danger of an incident
                                which might bring about open warfare; and (2) that his Government
                                had reason to believe that on a high political level in both India
                                and Pakistan such a cease fire order by the Security Council would
                                be welcomed.</p>
                            <p>Sir Alexander then stated that as a second step his Government
                                believed that a high-powered and prominent “mediator” should be sent
                                to the sub-continent to attempt to bring about a settlement of the
                                Kashmir issue. He said that since it was obviously inadvisable to
                                send someone from the British Commonwealth, and since it was
                                doubtful that a suitable person was available in such areas as Latin
                                America, his Government had come to the conclusion that an American
                                citizen with a nationally known name should be selected for this
                                task. He then added that he had been requested to approach me
                                regarding the availability of General Eisenhower.</p>
                            <p>As to the basis on which a “mediator” might now be sent to the
                                subcontinent, Sir Alexander said that to avoid the possibility of a
                                Soviet veto, his Government believed that the Secretary-General
                                could, under certain provisions of the Security Council Resolution
                                of April 21, send a “mediator” to the sub-continent in the guise of
                                the “Plebiscite Administrator” provided for in that resolution.</p>
                            <p>In my reply I made several observations with regard to the
                                difficulties of administering a cease fire order on the basis of my
                                experience in China and added that I had been particularly disturbed
                                to hear from Ambassador Huddle, our Representative on the United
                                Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, that it might take at
                                least three years before a plebiscite could be held in Kashmir. I
                                then referred to the presence of British Officers in both the Indian
                                and Pakistani armies and inquired whether the interest of the two
                                parties alluded to in respect of a cease fire originated with them.
                                I was asked what disposition would be made of <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss> under the British plan.</p>
                            <p>With reference to the availability of General Eisenhower, I referred
                                to recent offers to interest him in taking some relatively routine
                                obligations outside the sphere of his university position, and
                                General Eisenhower’s strongly expressed feelings that he wanted to
                                dig into his present highly responsible job.</p>
                            <p>In their reply to the foregoing, Sir Alexander and Mr. Curson gave
                                somewhat different versions of the reasons which prompted the
                                British to believe that a cease fire would be successful. Sir
                                Alexander stressed his belief that it was high political leaders on
                                both sides who <pb n="447" xml:id="pg_447" facs="0461"/>wanted the
                                cease fire; whereas Mr. Curson stated that owing to the presence of
                                British officers in each army, it would be easier to administer the
                                cease fire than otherwise. In a somewhat general discussion of the
                                actual military position, about which no one present appeared to be
                                fully informed, Sir Alexander referred to recent discussions
                                relating to the Negeb and Palestine and the possibility of
                                establishing neutral or demilitarized zones rather than a clear-cut
                                truce or cease fire line. In connection with the timing of the
                                plebiscite, Mr. Curson thought that although an ideal plebiscite
                                might require some delay, he thought that a simple one could be held
                                much earlier than three years from now.</p>
                            <p>With regard to the relationship between the “mediator” and <gloss
                                    target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss>, Sir Alexander stated that his
                                people were not quite clear on this. He indicated that on the basis
                                of recent conversations between the British and Mr. Colban,
                                Secretary-General of <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss>, the
                                impression had been created that the Commission did not wish to
                                return to the sub-continent, Mr. Colban had apparently expressed
                                great interest in his own return to India as a kind of rump
                                commission and had mentioned that Ambassador Huddle would be only
                                six air hours away in Rangoon.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Thurston inquired of Sir Alexander concerning the technical basis
                                on which it would be possible to send a “mediator” out to India in
                                view of the language of the Security Council Resolution of April 21
                                which presumably requires the consent of the Government of India to
                                the appointment of a Plebiscite Administrator, and added that
                                neither India nor Pakistan had ever accepted the recommendations
                                contained in the April 21 resolution with respect to a
                                plebiscite.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Thurston also expressed the thought that perhaps the new American
                                Ambassador to India who would be arriving in New Delhi shortly might
                                be able to be of some assistance in connection with this difficult
                                problem.</p>
                            <p>In the course of the conversation, Sir Alexander read from the
                                instructions which he had in hand several sentences regarding the
                                urgent need for stabilization in Southeast Asia because of the
                                spread of Communism, the Soviet threat to the Northwest frontier,
                                the effect of the inflation caused by India’s large military budget
                                in delaying economic recovery, and the threat of war as a retarding
                                factor in the development of the country by private capital.</p>
                            <p>Reference was also made in Sir Alexander’s instructions to the
                                present serious difficulties in China which make it all the more
                                important that the situation in South Asia be stabilized.</p>
                            <p>I then referred to Nehru’s recent speech before the General Assembly
                                in which he had so strongly stressed his belief in the settlement of
                                all disputes by non-violent means and speculated whether in view of
                                    <pb n="448" xml:id="pg_448" facs="0462"/>this it might be useful
                                for me to speak to Mrs. Pandit<note n="1" xml:id="d356fn1">Vijaya
                                    Lakshmi Pandit.</note> with regard to the inconsistency between
                                such facts and the Indian attitude in Kashmir. Sir Alexander then
                                interpolated—”and in Hyderabad too”—and with respect to the question
                                of my talking with Mrs. Pandit asked me to refrain from saying
                                anything about the present conversation. At this juncture, I alluded
                                to recent conversations which I had had with the Prime Ministers of
                                India and Pakistan who, although “speaking the same language” and
                                who, although stressing the Communist threat and the need for
                                stability, did not seem to be willing to suit action to their words.
                                I stated that in my conversation with the Pakistan Prime Minister,
                                he had indicated great interest in the Palestine question and had
                                said that we were not giving sufficient attention to the Middle
                                East. I mentioned that Nehru had not mentioned Palestine. I added
                                that I had told the Pakistan Prime Minister that I was up to my neck
                                in Palestine.</p>
                            <p>After a general discussion of the serious block to economic and
                                political progress the Palestine and Kashmir problems represent, I
                                referred to the delicate position in which Americans are likely to
                                be placed in India and the fact that India and Pakistan would no
                                doubt like to play the United States and the United Kingdom off
                                against each other. I referred to the many generations of British
                                experience in the area and to our role as newcomers. Sir Alexander
                                quickly replied that perhaps our being newcomers was a great
                                advantage.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the conversation, I assured Sir Alexander that we would
                                give careful consideration to his Government’s views and made no
                                comment when he pressed me on the possibility of getting some other
                                American if Eisenhower were not available.</p>

                                from London has just informed us that Prime Minister of Pakistan
                                yesterday informed Prime Minister UK “that India has now started an
                                all-out offensive with the obvious object of securing military
                                decision before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> considers UN
                                Commission to India and Pakistan’s report.” Prime Minister Pakistan
                                requested UK immediately use influence with Nehru and expedite
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> action to order and enforce an
                                unconditional cease-fire immediately. Cadogan understands message
                                has been sent to Nehru. British sources do not absolutely confirm
                                allegation concerning Indian offensive and admit possibility
                                Pakistan may have misinterpreted limited operation Indian forces
                                reinforcing one garrison. Zafrulla informed <gloss
                                    target="#t_UKDel1">UKDel</gloss> this morning he had while in US
                                received instructions to call for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                meeting to take this action but was waiting for Kashmir Commission
                                action which he understood would be taken this week. Zafrulla will
                                not therefore move until Monday at earliest, UK requests soonest
                                indication US view regarding such <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                action next week. Cadogan stated he assumed it would be
                                impracticable for <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> at same moment
                                to act on their desire for a plebiscite administered along lines he
                                explained to the Secretary. Cadogan also raised question of
                                supplying observers if <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> adopts
                                cease-fire order. He had no solution of this problem but said he
                                would ask London.</p>

                                observed the undertaking given but that India on other hand now
                                appears determined force military decision in Kashmir. Telegram
                                details reinforcements brought into Southern Kashmir by Indian Army
                                and mentions recent attacks in brigade strength against Azad Kashmir
                                forces. Says Indian Army has now started major offensive by at least
                                one division supported by armor from Rajauri towards Kotli and
                                Mendhar and is continually moving up reinforcements to Naushera.
                                Telegram continues “Object undoubtedly is all-out offensive to
                                obtain possession of Western Kashmir including Mirpur, Mangla head
                                works and the whole of Poonch. Heavy fighting is now in progress on
                                this front and renewed flow of refugees into West Pakistan has
                                already begun as result of this Indian Army offensive.</p>
                            <p>Army has also renewed attack by at least one brigade over Zojila Pass
                                and has penetrated defences of Dras. These attacks on both fronts
                                are being supported by maximum air action. It is quite clear that

                                        toward Kargil should not be overlooked as this town controls
                                        communications on Indus river and route Kargil–Khalatse–Leh.
                                        Occupation of Kargil would relieve considerable hostile
                                        pressure on Leh and might be undertaken, providing hostile
                                        resistance weak and no great effort involved.</item>

                            <p>1029. Nye British High Commissioner called on Nehru several days ago
                                under instructions to discuss Pakistan charges of Indian offensive
                                in Kashmir. Nye told me Nehru (1) denied India engaged in offensive
                                or intended launch one near future; (2) described recent military
                                action as limited defensive measures to relieve Poonch and head of
                                [off] hostile column moving towards Leh. Nehru admitted about 5,000
                                reinforcements recently sent Kashmir allegedly provide more frequent
                                relief for troops long there (Nye has heard from other sources
                                figures somewhat in excess 5,000).</p>
                            <p>Nehru argued heatedly that although no offensive under way India had
                                every moral legal right therefor and if one were launched Pakistan
                                could have no reason complaining because Pakistan troops occupying
                                Indian territory. Nye then said even if India had right to attack,
                                as military man he could assure Nehru such offensive would end
                                disastrously despite Indian superiority, in numbers equipment
                                training, etc, Further, he would, stake his military reputation that
                                India could, not even in summer defeat Pakistani and, tribesmen in
                                Kashmir because of degree to which terrain and communications
                                factors favored Pakistan, Even if his estimate were wrong, and India
                                won military victory, it would be temporary unless India-maintained
                                indefinitely large garrisons in all Kashmir. <gloss target="#t_GOI1"
                                    >GOI</gloss> could be certain that at favorable moment tribesmen
                                and Pakistani would again ravage Kashmir unless political settlement
                                reached by Pakistan and India.</p>
                            <p>Nye assured me he endeavored drive home point that only final
                                solution was political and military solution impossible for either
                                side unless India should decide on war against all Pakistan. He told
                                Nehru he did not believe any Indian Government would consider this
                                because would be difficult for India survive as nation if it had
                                face indefinitely millions hostile Moslems within and without.</p>
                            <p>In reply my inquiry Nehru’s reaction Nye said latter seemed unhappy
                                and apparently did not feel in position to refute his arguments. He
                                added he sincerely believed everything he told Nehru and with other
                                British here would seize every opportunity impress on <gloss

                                Commissioner’s (UK) representative in Hyderabad based on personal
                                observation and conversations with top Indian and Hyderabad
                                officials and UK businessmen which reliable estimate conditions in
                                Hyderabad state.</p>
                            <p>According report police action casualties Hyderabad forces were 1400
                                killed, 700 wounded. Initial entry Indian troops was followed by
                                pillage, arson and murder by Indian forces, especially Sikhs.
                                Disciplinary action soon brought troops under control. Military
                                government is popular with public and is functioning efficiently.
                                Major General Chaudhuri has gained high prestige for impartial
                                handling of all disruptive elements.</p>
                            <p>Hyderabad Secretariat is continuing to function as before although
                                some former officials have been dismissed and there is leaven of
                                Indian civil servants. Nizam is powerless, has lost much prestige
                                with former ruling class; heir apparent not impressive; Asaf Jahi
                                dynasty seems finished.</p>

                            <p>Chaudhuri believes military government should continue six months,
                                but Nawab Zain Yar Jung thinks three to four months adequate. Both
                                expect trouble when civil authority assumes control since no
                                experienced group exists which can take control.</p>
                            <p>Swami Ramanand Tirth, leader State Congress, is Hindu communalist
                                whose possible assumption of power is viewed with misgivings in all

                                years. Report states “danger of communal rioting evidently still
                                exists and, short of exemplary military action, would be extremely
                                difficult to bring under rapid control if an outbreak on any scale

                                previously. In his informal presentation preliminary <gloss

                                which would enable latter “interfere” in matters other than

                                considered officer of state government, he stressed that powers

                                government. He agreed, however, that these powers should be

                                unnecessary.</p>
                            <p>In preliminary remarks Bajpai expressed hope <gloss

                                not presently inclined return sub-continent without some measure

                            <p>From foregoing obvious that old divergencies still plague efforts; at
                                peaceful settlements However, tendency is emerging on part both

                                powers relating free and impartial plebiscite. Though such agreement

                                    xml:id="pg_467" facs="0481"/>solution, it would bring cease-fire

                                informal meeting UK, US and Canadian representatives December 6 we
                                expressed our misgivings and stressed desirability <gloss

                                more balanced approach and, therefore, have more chance acceptance.
                                We prepared informal draft resolution along these lines as basis for

                            <p>During a conversation at the Department today, concerning Afghan
                                security requirements, Mr. Aziz<note n="1" xml:id="d384fn1">Abdul
                                    Hai Aziz, Afghan Undersecretary of National Economy.</note>
                                reiterated the view that cooperation between Afghanistan, Iran and
                                Pakistan was essential if these countries were to be secure.
                                However, Afghan agreement with Pakistan over the future of 6,000,000
                                    Pathans<note n="*" xml:id="d384fn2">Rather consistently referred
                                    to by Aziz as “Afghans” in this connection. [Footnote in the

                                    rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> for any real cooperation. He
                                felt that some “middle ground” arrangement could be worked out with
                                Pakistan which would be acceptable and viable. However, there should
                                in any case be another and equitable plebiscite enabling the Pathans
                                to opt for independence if they so desired. It was the Afghan hope
                                that the U.S. would use its influence with the UK and Pakistan to
                                bring this about.</p>
                            <p>He went on to say that Afghanistan feared the “denationalization” of
                                these 6,000,000 Pathans—with their absorption into Pakistan they
                                might in time become “semi-Punjabis”. This would be disastrous to
                                Afghanistan because its survival as a national entity depends upon
                                keeping the spiritual orientation of the Pathans toward Kabul, and
                                being able to draw on them for military support. At the same time,
                                    <pb n="474" xml:id="pg_474" facs="0488"/>Mr. Aziz says there are
                                about 1500 “Afghans” in key positions in the Pakistan
                                government.</p>
                            <p>Failure in bilateral negotiations to achieve the desired status for
                                the Pathans (i.e. independence or something close to it) would make
                                it necessary for the Afghan government to strengthen its ties and
                                influence with these Pathan elements in the Government of Pakistan,
                                possibly to accept some kind of federation with Pakistan in which
                                the Pathans would have appropriate standing.</p>
                            <p>In response to queries Mr. Aziz said the economic advancement of the
                                Pathans was more important to Afghanistan than it was to Pakistan
                                and indicated that his Government was willing and able to undertake
                                this burden. He further said the Pathans possessed leaders of
                                sufficient stature and ability to organize a new state. Perhaps it
                                would be feasible for Afghanistan and Pakistan jointly to support
                                and cooperate with such a state, which would then be a source of
                                strength to both of them, and would be an essential element in any
                                regional defense plan.</p>
                            <p>The writer mentioned the difficulty Pakistan faces in assuming the
                                responsibilities of statehood, and suggested that the injection at
                                this time of controversial issues such as the Pathan question would
                                complicate the problem and would not be conducive to the stability
                                which this government hopes may be attained and preserved in the
                                area. However he indicated that the U.S. was aware of the complex
                                and deep-seated nature of the tribal problem and was endeavoring to
                                keep an open mind on the subject.</p>
                            <p>
                                <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> This is the first time the writer
                                has noted an assertion by any of the Afghans of their economic
                                ability to fend for their tribal cousins in Pakistan.</p>
                            <p>Leaving aside the question of any new referendum it would seem that
                                real cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan not only cannot be
                                achieved, but recurring trouble for both countries can scarcely be
                                avoided until some move is made vis-à-vis the Pathans which will
                                satisfy, partially at least, the Afghan desire to maintain prestige
                                amongst them, without doing violence to Pakistan’s conception of its
                                sovereign rights and legal position. At the same time there would
                                appear to be a strong community of interest between the two
                                countries in (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the need for stability in
                                the border area, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) regional defense
                                possibilities. A step in the direction of cooperation might be
                                consideration by both countries of some joint responsibility for the
                                economic advancement of the tribal people.</p>

                                Commission held final meeting Monday before adjourning to reconvene
                                Lake Success January 3. Lozano, Colombian delegate, plans departure
                                this week for Delhi and Karachi to clarify questions which may be
                                raised by either Indians or Paks regarding meaning of terms of
                                plebiscite which have now been formally presented each government
                                for their consideration. Lozano, however, is not empowered enter
                                negotiations. If either government takes exception to proposals
                                Lozano must refer back to commission. He expects to rejoin
                                commission at Lake Success to report results his trip.</p>
                            <p>Military adviser preparing leave for sub-continent twenty-second
                                December, and Ambassador Colban, personal representative Secretary
                                General now acting secretary for commission will also go to
                                sub-continent with small staff. Commission hopes this fragmentary
                                representation may have soothing effect on present nervous relations
                                two countries pending commission’s final action in this phase of
                                situation.</p>
                            <p>Pakistan delegation headed by Zafrullah appeared before commission at
                                Monday meeting and seemed more or less content with commission’s
                                final proposals. Zafrullah however, I understand, insists on
                                discussing Hyderabad before <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                Wednesday morning, and what he says this subject may influence
                                Indian action on Kashmir question. Indian attitude could not be
                                ascertained clearly from Bajpai before his departure from Delhi, but
                                by the Hyderabad or other maneuver Pakistan might now be able to
                                throw burden rejection back on India.</p>
                            <p>Commission faces considerable reorganization. Argentine member Siri
                                has already been replaced by Minister Leguizamon; Czech member and
                                present chairman, Korbel, anticipates severing his connection
                                shortly after commission’s arrival New York under circumstances
                                which I will explain fully when I arrive; Belgian Minister Graeffe
                                    <pb n="478" xml:id="pg_478" facs="0492"/>has left commission and
                                has not yet been replaced. Problem my own continuance commission can
                                be taken up in Department in few days after my arrival. While Lozano
                                was formerly anxious for release from commission his present
                                attitude not certain.</p>

                                    <item>Nehru asked if December 11 proposals took priority over
                                        part III August 13 resolution which did not exclude possible
                                        solutions other than plebiscite. Lozano replied that
                                        proposals have priority and will reiterate this in view
                                        danger that <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> after
                                        fulfillment parts 1 and 2 might seek avoid plebiscite and

                                        proposals accepted plebiscite will follow unless: (1) <gloss

                            <p>As <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> has as yet raised no
                                substantive objections text December 11 proposals and as progress
                                made is so substantial answer which Lozano receives should be
                                indication whether India is really prepared accept in good faith a
                                plebiscite to determine will of population.</p>
                            <p>Cabinet discussing proposals today and Nehru may be able give <gloss

                                Bajpai has agreed remain until December 24.</p>
                            <p>Both Bajpai and Lozano seem to be fairly optimistic.</p>

                                Bajpai’s version of Dr. Lozano’s elucidation of the December 11
                                proposals and the Indian Government’s interpretation thereof and it
                                was intended that they should be agreed to by the Commission on the
                                one hand and the Government of India on the other. Inasmuch as the
                                memoranda as originally drafted would in Dr. Lozano’s opinion have
                                modified the Commission’s proposals he had explained that he had no
                                authority to consent to modifications or to negotiate in that
                                direction. His efforts therefore were directed at ensuring that his
                                own elucidations, as contained in the memoranda, adhered strictly to
                                the intent of the proposals. He said that he was not concerned with
                                what the Government of India might say by way of interpretation
                                inasmuch as that did not commit the Commission.</p>
                            <p>Following discussion of the various modifications which the Indian
                                Government had tried very subtly to introduce, apparently with the
                                intent of reserving to itself a freedom of action which the
                                proposals themselves did not envisage, the Ambassador pointed out
                                the importance of stressing still further to Sir Girja that the
                                Commission was not committed by the Indian Government’s
                                interpretations; whereas the latter, if it accepted the proposals,
                                was fully committed to a definite course of action. The conversation
                                revealed that Bajpai was still embarrassed by his failure to make
                                clear to his Government that the Commission would have the ultimate
                                authority as to the disposition of <pb n="480" xml:id="pg_480"

                                telephoned me and asked me to come to see him at his house at 9:30,
                                which I did. Sir Zafrullah said that he had received a number of
                                explanations and elucidations of the Commission’s proposals from Dr.
                                Lozano, and he narrated at some length what he described as the
                                advantages and disadvantages of gambling on an acceptance of the
                                proposals. He asked me what I thought about the matter. I told him
                                    <pb n="482" xml:id="pg_482" facs="0496"/>that in my opinion
                                Pakistan was over a barrel and that they had better accept the
                                proposals. I added that I felt that from every point of view it was
                                in the interest of Pakistan to accept them. Sir Zafrullah then said
                                that he himself had arrived at that conclusion and that he was going
                                to recommend their acceptance to the Cabinet that afternoon.
                                However, he then stressed that he was basing this action on the hope
                                that the U.S. Government would make available to the United Nations
                                an outstanding retired Army or Naval officer to act as
                                Administrator. He mentioned in this connection, as the type of
                                officer he would like to see made available, Admiral Nimitz or
                                General Wedemeyer. He said that Pakistan did not want a politician
                                appointed to the post. I asked Sir Zafrullah what assurance he had,
                                even assuming that such an officer were made available by the United
                                States, that the officer would be appointed by the United Nations.
                                He answered that he was confident in his own mind that if the
                                officer were made available he would be appointed. I gathered that
                                this suggestion was the primary purpose of Sir Zafrullah’s asking me
                                to come to see him as he strongly emphasized on more than one
                                occasion during the conversation the importance of the appointment
                                of an American officer of the type in question as the plebiscite
                                administrator.</p>
                            <p>A few minutes later I met by prearrangement Dr. Lozano and Dr. Colban
                                at their hotel. Dr. Lozano reviewed at considerable length his
                                conversations with Pandit Nehru. In view of the explanations and
                                assurances which he stated that he had given to Nehru I asked Dr.
                                Lozano if he had explained all this to Sir Zafrullah. He said that
                                he had, that he had withheld nothing from Sir Zafrullah, and that he
                                was hopeful that Sir Zafrullah would go along with him although he
                                was by no means sure of this. In a second conversation which he was
                                to have at noon with Sir Zafrullah he intended, he said, to give
                                such further “clarifications and elucidations” as Sir Zafrullah
                                might desire, so far as this was practicable but that he, if pressed
                                too hard, also intended to inform Sir Zafrullah that he had no
                                powers to negotiate or to enter into any commitments beyond those
                                contained or implied in the Commission’s proposals.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Lozano met Sir Zafrullah at the appointed time. After further
                                discussions they then had lunch with the Governor General. Further
                                discussions ensued during the afternoon. The Cabinet met at the
                                Governor General’s house at 6:30 and was in session until about 8:00
                                p. m.</p>
                            <p>The Cabinet’s decision was then made known to Dr. Lozano and Dr.
                                Colban, and Dr. Lozano departed, in accordance with his schedule,
                                for New York by Pan American plane during the early hours of the
                                following morning, December 26, Immediately before his departure Dr.
                                Lozano released the following statement:</p>
                            <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0497"/>

                                <p>“I came to the sub-continent to confer with the Governments of
                                    India and Pakistan on certain general proposals regarding the

                            <p>I saw Dr. Colban at 10:30 a. m. that day, December 26, and he
                                informed me in strict confidence for communication to Ambassador
                                Huddle that the Cabinet’s decision had been favorable. He then
                                reviewed the recommendations which he was drafting for transmission
                                to the Secretary General of the United Nations and said that he was
                                proceeding the following morning to New Delhi to continue his work
                                from that point. He was naturally immensely relieved by the action
                                of the Government of Pakistan and expressed his warm gratification
                                that Dr. Lozano’s mission had been successfully accomplished.</p>
                            <p>While the Cabinet concurred with Sir Zafrullah’s recommendations this
                                is not to say that there are still no doubts concerning the eventual
                                outcome or that there are no apprehensions that Pakistan’s
                                acceptance, or acquiescence, may not bring about a storm of protest
                                from tribal elements in the North West Frontier and possibly also
                                from the Azad Kashmir people. Wisdom, tact, judgement, patience and
                                perhaps no little firmness will probably be required when the
                                Government’s action becomes publicly known. If Nehru has difficult
                                elements—a point which Dr. Lozano said Nehru elaborated at length—in
                                India to deal with, it might be well to bear in mind that there will
                                probably be some difficult elements in this country also with which
                                the Government of Pakistan will have to contend. It was no doubt a
                                recognition of this that prompted Dr. Lozano, at least in part, to
                                issue just before his departure his statement previously quoted.</p>
                            <p>It has just been noted in a telegram repeated from London that Sir
                                Paul Patrick had expressed the view to a representative of the
                                Embassy there that the Netherlands action in Indonesia would not
                                help in the matter of Kashmir. I am inclined to feel that, although
                                the Security Council’s resolution on the Indonesian question did not
                                by any means go as far as the Government of Pakistan desired, the
                                precipitate action of Pakistan in vigorously championing the cause
                                    <pb n="484" xml:id="pg_484" facs="0498"/>of the Indonesians made
                                it difficult if not virtually impossible for Pakistan logically,
                                while calling indirectly on the Security Council for stern action in
                                that matter, then to have brushed the United Nations aside in the
                                matter of Kashmir. The latter would assuredly have been implied had
                                Pakistan not accepted the <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss>’s
                                proposals. Logic of action amongst nations may not always
                                necessarily be expected, but I believe that logic in this case may
                                have played a strong part in Pakistan’s decision, combined with the
                                certain knowledge that Pakistan would again have been saddled with
                                the onus for the failure of the Commission’s efforts if the
                                Commission’s proposals were not accepted.</p>

                                        Kashmir problem India cannot make progress in carrying out

                                    The conversation was between the Director of National Economy
                                    and the Director General, Political Division, Ministry of
                                    Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan, and the American Minister and
                                    Secretary of Legation in Afghanistan. The subject of
                                    conversation was an Afghan request for a loan of $100,000,000 to
                                    finance a ten-year program of public works to raise the standard
                                    of living (890H.51/1–748).</note> (See Enclosure I.) The
                                conversation at that time was very general and exploratory in
                                nature.</p>
                            <p>As a follow-up to the conversation, the Afghan Government sent the

                                (See Enclosure II.) This gave a general outline of the Government’s

                            <p>August 6, 1946, I sent His Excellency, the Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs, a pamphlet published by the Export-Import Bank of
                                Washington under date of September 11, 1945 as a “General Policy
                                Statement”, and copy of the Export-Import Bank’s First Semi-annual
                                Report to Congress for the period July-December 1945. Both the
                                pamphlet and report were read and returned, but nothing further of a
                                tangible nature was done until the summer of 1947, when a list of
                                specific questions was compiled by this Legation and forwarded to
                                the Ministry of National Economy to help the Afghan Government
                                crystalize into definite terms its rather general planning. (See

                                repaying of the loan if granted was especially well presented. The
                                questions also brought to light very detailed and concrete planning
                                for improving of transportartion, building dams and irrigation
                                systems, developing a cement industry, and increasing the cotton
                                textile industry. The answers to the questions also showed that
                                little hard planning had been done on the subject of improving the
                                agriculture of the country, although this must be an integral part
                                of the dam construction and irrigation projects and was a major
                                section in the general outline of improvement submitted to this
                                Legation in the Afghan Government’s <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Aide-Mémoire</hi> of July 16, 1946.</p>
                            <p>Two general conclusions are apparent from the Afghan Government’s
                                answers to the Legation’s questionnaire. First, the Afghan
                                Government has done some good, realistic planning which would
                                indicate that it has a sound basis for requesting a loan and would
                                be a good risk. Second, the Afghan Government has no one properly
                                trained to present their request for a loan in a manner that will
                                assure it of the best possible reception, nor has the Legation
                                anyone prepared to give the Afghan Government proper professional
                                advice. Accordingly, it is my opinion, and I have so advised the
                                Afghan Government in informal talks, that the Afghan Government
                                should obtain the professional services of some firm like the
                                International Hudson Corporation of New York City. It is my opinion,
                                after reading about the International Hudson Corporation and seeing
                                the names of the men connected with it that such a firm would be in
                                a position to recommend to the Afghan Government, or draft for the
                                Afghan Government, the presentation of its case for a loan in a form
                                that would have the best chance of being accepted by the
                                Export-Import Bank, the World Bank or any private bank the Afghan
                                Government might wish to approach. Also, such a firm as
                                International Hudson Corporation would be in a position to send
                                specialists to Afghanistan to help the Government on the spot if
                                necessary. I would appreciate the Department’s suggestion in this
                                matter.</p>
                            <p>As the matter now stands, the Afghan Government is going ahead on its
                                own in drawing up a request for a loan and is using their answers to
                                the Legation’s questionnaire as a basis for their presentation. I
                                have assured the Afghan Government of all possible further
                                assistance in this regard on the part of the Legation.</p>

                            <p>In connection with this history of the Afghan Government’s desire for

                                American Diplomatic Mission in Afghanistan from Legation to
                                Embassy.</p>
                            <p>Our Minister at Kabul is of the opinion that the Afghan Government
                                would welcome a change in the status of our mission from Legation to
                                Embassy.</p>
                            <p>As a consequence of the participation of an American engineering firm
                                and American technicians and teachers in the development of the
                                country, the American community in Afghanistan is now larger than
                                that of any other foreign state. A growing tendency on the part of
                                Afghanistan to look to the United States for assistance in many
                                fields is reflected by visits during the past year of two Prime
                                Ministers and the Minister of Public Works, who have discussed
                                Afghan problems with officials of this Government. As a member of
                                the United Nations and an increasingly active participant in
                                international conferences, Afghanistan, subject to the difficulties
                                implicit in its contiguity to the Soviet Union, endeavors to align
                                itself with the western democracies.</p>
                            <p>This Government has now exchanged ambassadors with practically all
                                countries in the area from Iraq to Siam, and it is believed that our
                                interests in Afghanistan warrant the extension of ambassadorial
                                representation to that country on a reciprocal basis. A number of
                                countries, including the Soviet Union, have embassies in Kabul, and
                                France is currently considering making its Legation an Embassy.</p>

                                principle with the recommendation that this Government raise the
                                status of its Legation in Afghanistan to that of Embassy.<note n="1"

                            <p>H. E. Majid said Afghanistan had a small army, which had been able to
                                control the internal situation up to the partition of India. Now the
                                situation is altered. Formerly these forces could cope with internal
                                difficulties on one front. Now Afghanistan might have to deal with
                                difficulties single-handed and simultaneously in two or more areas.
                                Afghanistan’s armaments lag far behind those of her neighbors, and
                                supplies from India have not been forthcoming. During the past year
                                they have been nil. In the South and East there are armed tribesmen
                                who of necessity are accustomed to living by their guns. The economy
                                of this area is backward, even by Afghan standards. As a rusty gun
                                is dangerous to the owner and his neighbors a “rusty” economy is
                                likewise full of peril. Afghanistan has no adequate defenses in the
                                north, <pb n="492" xml:id="pg_492" facs="0506"/>nor even proper
                                local security forces. A small revolt in any part of the country
                                could be extremely dangerous to overall stability, because this
                                would necessitate troop withdrawals from other areas of potential
                                disorder.</p>
                            <p>Afghanistan urgently wants U.S. arms to maintain internal security
                                for the reasons set forth above. Secondly it wants U.S. arms in
                                order to make a positive contribution in the event there is war with
                                the Soviets. Properly armed, and convinced of U.S. backing,
                                Afghanistan could manage a delaying action in the passes of the
                                Hindu Kush which would be a contribution to the success of the armed
                                forces of the West and might enable them to utilize bases which
                                Pakistan and India might provide.</p>
                            <p>At this point the meeting adjourned with arrangements for further
                                talks left between the representatives of the Afghan mission and the
                                Afghanistan desk officer.</p>

                            <p>In an informal discussion of several hours duration, following a
                                State Department luncheon in honor of the newly accredited
                                Ambassador of Afghanistan, the Minister of National Economy again
                                expressed the desire of his government for a definite statement of
                                U.S. intentions with regard to assistance to his country. He said
                                Afghanistan must know just where it stands, in the world-wide
                                pattern, with regard to U.S. assistance.</p>
                            <p>He reiterated the opinion that a U.S.-Afghan partnership, with
                                assurance that Afghanistan has our firm support, would be of value
                                to both countries. However, time is growing short, and Afghanistan
                                must have an answer soon. If the U.S. is eventually going to reach a
                                negative conclusion on assistance to Afghanistan, Afghanistan would
                                like to know this fact at the earliest possible moment. Although a
                                negative decision would have a very adverse effect upon national
                                morale, the Afghan Government would continue to look upon the United
                                States <pb n="493" xml:id="pg_493" facs="0507"/>as its friend, while
                                attempting to work out its own problems on a realistic basis.</p>
                            <p>Abdul Majid explained that in speaking of assistance he had in mind
                                the following categories: (1) political, (2) economic, (3) cultural,
                                educational and technical, and (4) military.</p>
                            <p>Passing over the economic, cultural, educational and technical
                                aspects, <gloss target="#t_HE1">H.E.</gloss> turned to the subject
                                of military assistance, emphasizing that Afghanistan was thinking in
                                terms of equipment for internal security purposes only. For such
                                purposes, no large amount of expensive equipment is required.
                                Compared with assistance the US has extended on a world wide scale,
                                Afghanistan’s requirements are microscopic.</p>
                            <p>Abdul Majid referred repeatedly to the “war”, indicating his belief
                                that a war between the US and USSR is inevitable, and said that when
                                war came Afghanistan would of course be overrun and occupied. But
                                the Russians would be unable to pacify the country. Afghanistan
                                could and would pursue guerrilla tactics for an indefinite
                                period.</p>
                            <p>Abdul Majid said that the early supply of light military equipment
                                for internal defense was closely related to the possibility for a
                                long and determined resistance to some future aggressive action by
                                the USSR.</p>
                            <p>In connection with military cooperation he indicated that a regional
                                pact among Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan was a reasonable
                                possibility. If US assistance were extended to include the countries
                                in this arc, it would cost relatively little now to create a Muslim
                                cordon which would be a considerable factor in any future struggle
                                with Soviet Russia. A little later this might be very costly or
                                impossible.</p>
                            <p>The Department’s representative said that our wish had been to
                                cooperate with Afghanistan. No change in this attitude was foreseen.
                                We hope to see Afghanistan preserve its independence and to
                                make-progress toward its goals of social and economic betterment.
                                Within the limits of our facilities and responsibilities elsewhere
                                it was reasonable to assume that our efforts would continue to be
                                directed toward these objectives; that our cooperation was prompted
                                not only by general considerations (such as a desire for the
                                improvement of living conditions the world over) but also by the
                                desire to encourage Afghanistan itself in its orientation toward the
                                Western political philosophy.</p>
                            <p>Reference was made to some specific types of assistance now being;
                                rendered in cultural, educational and scientific matters, and the
                                belief was expressed that this would be continued as possible if
                                requested by Afghanistan. It is to be hoped that this program will
                                eventually become an exchange.</p>
                            <pb n="494" xml:id="pg_494" facs="0508"/>
                            <p>With regard to financial assistance it was indicated that at present
                                this matter awaits further action by the Afghans themselves. The
                                Department had previously indicated that it would support a request
                                by Afghanistan for reasonable Export-Import Bank credits in so far
                                as these were in line with the policies of the Bank. Our position on
                                this has not changed. Such does not however, necessarily carry
                                assurance that an Afghan loan would be approved. Abdul Majid was
                                encouraged to avail himself of help which officials of the
                                Department offered in connection with any problems in this case.</p>
                            <p>With regard to U.S. cooperation in respect to Afghan internal
                                security requirements, reference was made to the fact that the
                                Department had already indicated that sympathetic consideration
                                would be given to a specific request for military equipment, that we
                                could not even consider whether we would recommend supplying such
                                equipment to Afghanistan until definite information had been given
                                concerning the details of its security program and the
                                specifications of its requirements. Even if the supply of military
                                equipment should be recommended this would have to be considered by
                                the military authorities in relation to other areas and claimants,
                                before final action could be taken on the request.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Majid stated that details of the arms request would be furnished
                                to the Department quite soon.</p>

                            <p>The difficulty of proceeding with negotiations except on such a basis
                                is fully appreciated. The situation is somewhat similar here, except
                                that the Government of India has not asked for a loan. India, as in
                                the case of Pakistan, is not in a position at this time to avail
                                itself of many of the mutual benefits to be derived from a treaty of
                                friendship, commerce and navigation with the United States and has
                                shown no eagerness to begin discussions of such a treaty.</p>
                            <p>It is hardly necessary to point out, however, that any financial
                                aid-given by the United States to Pakistan so long as relations
                                between India and Pakistan continue to be strained, would be
                                regarded by India as an unfriendly act. It not only would prejudice
                                the prospects of negotiating a treaty of friendship, commerce and
                                navigation with India, but also would have an adverse effect on all
                                aspects of United States relations with India and possibly even more
                                far reaching international repercussions. In this connection,
                                attention is called to the recent dispute between India and Pakistan
                                over the cash balances of the former undivided Government of India.
                                India feared that if it paid to Pakistan the remaining share of the
                                balances due to the latter under their financial agreement, the
                                money would be used to support the raiders in Kashmir against India.

                            <p>Financial aid to Pakistan might be viewed differently if India were
                                informally approached in advance and the aid were extended in such a
                                way that it could be directed only toward economic ends. However, in
                                such circumstances, India might demand similar aid.</p>

                                and Other Military Material to India and Pakistan</p>
                            <p>The Department has recently been approached by representatives of
                                India and Pakistan with a view to the purchase and export to these
                                countries of military material requiring export licensing. It is
                                expected that India and Pakistan will make further requests of this
                                nature in the future.</p>
                            <p>Careful consideration has been given by the appropriate officials of
                                the Department to the advisability of allowing military materials to
                                be shipped to India and Pakistan at this time, and the tentative
                                conclusion has been reached that in view of the tense situation
                                prevailing in the Indian subcontinent as a result of disputes over
                                Kashmir and other Issues, which each party has declared to
                                constitute threats to international peace, licenses should not be
                                issued for the export of military material to either India or
                                Pakistan until the situation becomes more clarified. The Department
                                further believes that a comparable policy should be adopted with
                                regard to the transfer, retransfer, and sales of military items
                                under the control of the Office of the Foreign Liquidation
                                Commissioner insofar as India and Pakistan are concerned, unless
                                evidence is produced to show that such materials are intended for
                                civilian or commercial use in India and Pakistan. It is not proposed
                                to establish a formal embargo with the publicity which such action
                                would entail.</p>
                            <p>The foregoing policy is consistent with the attitude taken by this
                                Government in the deliberations on the India-Pakistan question in
                                the Security Council of the United Nations, in that United States
                                representative has emphasized that the disputes between the parties
                                should be settled by pacific means.</p>

                                felt deeply concerned lest either Chinese or Indian Ambassador in
                                Moscow should know that he had passed this along for information of

                                    printed.</note> At his request I saw last evening H. V. R.
                                Iengar, Acting Secretary General External Affairs in Bajpai’s
                                absence. Prime Minister wished him to discuss with me recent
                                statement on foreign policy which Prime Minister made in Assembly.
                                Prime Minister wanted to be sure US did not misunderstand what he
                                was endeavoring to convey. The speech he said was primarily for home
                                consumption and to say certain things to Russia which he felt should
                                foe said. He said that it was unthinkable that India should be on
                                Russia’s side in event of conflict between Russia and US. American
                                principles of democracy and those of India were identical. He wishes
                                to maintain officially for his government a neutral position. I said
                                that I did not see any objection to this policy but found it hard to
                                understand the Prime Minister’s frequent reference to imperialism
                                and that I had heard from reliable sources that Prime Minister had
                                been critical of our government and of America. Iengar said that as
                                one who had been intimately associated with the Prime Minister for
                                long time he found it hard to believe this as Prime Minister never
                                criticized America to him. Iengar stated that Prime Minister had
                                been disappointed <pb n="499" xml:id="pg_499" facs="0513"/>in our

                                friendliness to US. He stated further that Prime Minister is
                                concerned about spread of Communism in India and said very
                                confidentially measures are being taken to eliminate Communists from
                                government.</p>
                            <p>He also stated that their military intelligence which was completely
                                disorganized and in effect nonexistent last August is now being well
                                organized and is giving careful attention to northern border. He
                                stated further that resolution introduced in <gloss target="#t_SC1"

                            <p>512. Can confirm information given by Chinese Ambassador New Delhi to
                                Ambassador Grady on statements of Mrs. Pandit. She has had similar
                                confidential conversations with me and, I believe, with heads
                                practically all missions in Moscow except Soviet satellites.</p>
                            <p>She is obviously much concerned at Molotov’s change in attitude, but
                                there is no real reason why she should be as both British Ambassador
                                and myself had warned her honeymoon period for her would last few
                                months and thereafter she would have to take bitter with sweet, with
                                emphasis on former.</p>
                            <p>She asked my advice as to whether, in event public opinion in India
                                further aroused, it would be good move for India to discontinue
                                present relations with USSR, and said public opinion in India so
                                aroused it would probably be difficult to send another chief of
                                mission when she left. I told her I thought it would be tactical

                            <p>She emphasized her brother<note n="1" xml:id="d401fn1">Prime Minister

                                Soviet Ambassador New Delhi. She herself now restricts her
                                attendance at Soviet official functions to about fifteen
                                minutes.</p>
                            <p>She informed me Nehru and most Indian leaders had long since made up
                                their minds natural alignment was with west, but that Nehru felt at
                                present in view Indian relative impotence and fact that nation is
                                still in swaddling clothes it would be ridiculous to talk publicly
                                of military participation in event of war. Her belief, which
                                apparently reflects that of brother, is that India’s present role in
                                family of nations should be modest and relatively humble one until
                                nation has solved own internal difficulties.</p>

                            <p>Sir Girja called on Mr. Henderson at 2:30 at the former’s
                                request.</p>
                            <p>[Omitted here is a paragraph concerned with the feasibility of
                                bringing a collection of Indian art to the United States for
                                exhibition.]</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja next referred to the possibility of a visit to the United
                                States by Prime Minister Nehru. He said that he personally had urged
                                the Prime Minister to come to this country and that, if the
                                President issued an invitation, Nehru would of course accept. As far
                                as time was concerned, Sir Girja felt that such a trip would not be
                                practicable before next June. Mr. Hare said that we had had word
                                from our Embassy in New Delhi to the effect that Nehru might be able
                                to come to <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0516"/>this country
                                this month and after making inquiries of the <gloss
                                    target="#t_White1">White</gloss> House, had informed Ambassador
                                Grady that it would be convenient for the President to receive Nehru
                                between April 19 and 24. Sir Girja expressed surprise at this most
                                recent development and indicated considerable doubt that the Prime
                                Minister would be able to come this month owing to the pressure of
                                affairs. Mr. Henderson pointed out that, if it were impracticable
                                for Nehru to come at present, we could give further thought to
                                working out arrangements for a visit, later this year.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girija then turned to an exposition of Indian foreign policy
                                which he stated was the real purpose of his visit to the United
                                States and his calls at the State Department. He sketched first of
                                all the present status of India pointing out that the Indian people
                                were now responsible for their own destiny, that British troops had
                                withdrawn from Indian territory, and that practically no British
                                civilians remained in Indian Government positions. He commented with
                                respect to the last point that the situation was quite different in
                                Pakistan. He said, however, that it had been necessary to retain
                                British officers in the Indian Army as there simply were not enough
                                trained Indian personnel available to staff the upper echelons. In
                                short, India is now its own master.</p>
                            <p>Having expelled the British, India, did not intend to take on any
                                other master in their stead. Sir Girja felt, however, that there was
                                some impression in the United States that India was tending to
                                become a Communist state or at least a “fellow-travelling” state.
                                Mr. Henderson commented that that view was not held in U.S.
                                Government quarters. Although certain actions of individual Indian
                                representatives at international conferences had seemed open to
                                various interpretations, we had been confident all along that the
                                Indian Government itself was fully aware of the basic issues at
                                stake. He went on to say that he wished to make it clear that the
                                issue was not between “American imperialism” and Soviet imperialism;
                                that we had no objection to Russia’s establishing close relations
                                with other nations provided that this were not done by aggression,
                                pressure, and the suppression of freedom; and that the real issue
                                was the maintenance and strengthening of democracy in the face of a
                                totalitarian threat.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja said that he appreciated the importance of Mr. Henderson’s
                                remarks and was gratified that the U.S. Government was aware of the
                                basic democratic orientation of the Government of India. He went on
                                to point out that India’s position had been more accurately
                                reflected in the 1947 <gloss target="#t_UNGA1">UNGA</gloss> than in
                                the 1946 session, citing India’s support of our stand with respect
                                to Korea and other issues. This brought him to the principal point
                                he desired to make. Should the world once again become involved in
                                conflict, India could only associate <pb n="503" xml:id="pg_503"
                                    facs="0517"/>itself with, those nations holding the same ideals
                                of freedom and democracy. However, his Government is not able to
                                make an open declaration of its position as it could not now
                                withstand the aggression from Russia or the internal difficulties
                                which might ensue.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Thurston said that some of us had been disturbed by the
                                anti-American tone of portions of the Indian press which had taken
                                the position that the United States wished to assume Britain’s
                                relinquished position in India. Sir Girja replied that he was aware
                                of the type of press comment to which Mr. Thurston referred but that
                                he wished to make a clear distinction between the thinking of
                                responsible Government officials and the irresponsible press. He
                                said that the Indian press was inexperienced in the field of foreign
                                affairs and that it was inclined to treat such matters in emotional
                                rather than rational terms. Furthermore, there was a good bit of
                                popular feeling in India, not shared in Government circles, that the
                                United States was aiding the Dutch in Indonesia and the French in
                                Indochina. This feeling was reflected in the press treatment of the
                                United States.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja then touched briefly on Indo-Pakistan relations emphasizing
                                that India had no desire to eliminate Pakistan as an independent
                                state or to reincorporate into an Indian union the territories now
                                held by Pakistan. Mr. Henderson interjected that the State
                                Department had been aware that such was the Indian position. Sir
                                Girja went on to say that a political reunion of the two Dominions
                                was most unlikely in the foreseeable future, but that he would hope
                                for an understanding which would permit joint defense of the Indian
                                sub-continent whose critical frontier now lay in Pakistan, and
                                possibly a customs union. He did not feel that Indo-Pakistan
                                relations presented any serious or insuperable problems.</p>
                            <p>Turning next to the question of India’s position in South Asia, Sir
                                Girja said that India had no desire to form or to lead a South Asian
                                bloc. He said in strict confidence that when Thakin Nu<note n="4"
                                    xml:id="d403fn4">Prime Minister and Minister for National
                                    Planning.</note> of Burma recently visited India, he brought
                                with him a draft project for a “United Nations of South Asia”. This
                                was studied by Nehru and the Foreign Office, and Thakin Nu was
                                informed that India did not consider it desirable to establish such
                                an organization which would detract from the authority of the global
                                United Nations and introduce into world politics a further racial
                                and regional element. India feels that its first task is to develop
                                itself.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja concluded his broad sketch of Indian foreign policy with a
                                discussion of India’s relationship to the British Commonwealth. He
                                pointed out that the draft constitution left open the question of
                                this relationship, but added that it would clearly not be possible
                                for India to recognize the King as titular head of the state. The
                                exact terms <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0518"/>of the
                                relationship which might be worked out would depend largely on the
                                attitude of the British but the continuance of imperial preference
                                was definitely out of the question. Certain arrangements with
                                respect to defense might be worked out.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja then said that there was somthing of an impression in India
                                that the United States had very little interest in that country and
                                that he would like to know the Department’s views in that respect.
                                Mr. Henderson said that he was very grateful that Sir Girja had been
                                so frank in his comments and that he would be equally frank. It was
                                the considered opinion of the United States Government that in the
                                long term close and friendly relations between India and the United
                                States was the anchor of stability of the whole aim from Africa to
                                South East Asia. Unfortunately, at the moment the United States
                                found it necessary to concentrate its efforts and resources on
                                resisting aggression in certain other parts of the world. We
                                recognized this could be only a short term policy, but we were faced
                                with the problem of meeting an urgent and critical situation. We had
                                every intention of giving proper and essential attention to India
                                just as soon as circumstances permitted.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja said that he fully understood the necessity of the United
                                States concentrating its attention at present on certain critical
                                areas and that he had not come to this country with any mendicant
                                ideas. He had, in point of fact, done everything he could to quash
                                the idea of a Marshall Plan for South Asia which had been advocated
                                by the Indian Ambassador in Washington in despatches to New Delhi.
                                However, in order to give immediate evidence of our real interest in
                                India, Sir Girja urged that we urgently and seriously consider two
                                matters in which his country needed our assistance.</p>
                            <p>He referred to India’s desire to obtain American assistance in
                                carrying out certain hydro-electric developmental projects and said
                                that, although an approach had been made in this connection quite
                                some time ago, no assistance had yet been forthcoming. Mr. Hare said
                                that Ambassador Grady was keenly interested in this problem and that
                                he had pressed it vigorously while in the US on consultation. In
                                view of the Ambassador’s wide experience in economic matters, it
                                would be advisable for the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> to
                                continue to work with our Embassy in New Delhi on this question. Mr.
                                Henderson added that the Department had been endeavoring to
                                accomplish something along these lines but that the demands upon the
                                American engineering profession were simply in excess of the supply.
                                We would, however, continue our efforts to povide some assistance
                                and it might be that the recent Smith–Mundt Act<note n="5"
                                    xml:id="d403fn5">The United States Information and Educational
                                    Exchange Act of 1948. For text, see 62 Stat. 6.</note> would be
                                helpful.</p>
                            <pb n="505" xml:id="pg_505" facs="0519"/>
                            <p>Sir Girja then mentioned that Colonel Kaul, former Indian Military
                                Attaché in Washington, had reported that it was the present policy
                                of the United States to withhold exports of military materiel to
                                India. Mr. Thurston asked whether Kaul had pointed out that this
                                policy applied equally to Pakistan, and Sir Girja replied that Kaul
                                had not mentioned that aspect of our policy. Mr. Hare emphasized
                                that, with respect to the B–25’s which Colonel Kaul had requested,
                                the position was that, quite aside from the policy, that type of
                                plane simply was not available, there being none in this country
                                excess to the needs of our air force. Mr. Henderson pointed out that
                                the decision to withhold exports of military materiel had been taken
                                at a time when relations between India and Pakistan were quite tense
                                and there was a possibility of serious trouble between them. He
                                emphasized that it was not a permanent policy, and Mr. Hare added
                                that we hoped that it would be a policy for a matter of months or
                                preferably weeks. Sir Girja urged that the US not persist in this
                                policy, as it was of urgent necessity that India strengthen its
                                defenses. The Indian air force lacked bombers, and there were many
                                other essential military needs which could be met only by imports.
                                He would like very much to send a military mission to this country
                                to explore the possibilities of procuring essential military
                                equipment. Mr. Henderson said that it would be advisable for us to
                                give some preliminary thought to this proposal before taking any
                                definite action. In view of the indications that our own rearmament
                                would be stepped up, it would be necessary to ascertain from our
                                military people what the possibilities would be for sending military
                                equipment abroad.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja returned to Mr. Henderson’s office following his interview
                                with the Acting Secretary.<note n="6" xml:id="d403fn6">
                                    <hi rend="italic">Infra.</hi>
                                </note> He said that he had mentioned to Mr. Lovett India’s interest
                                in being considered for the seat on the Security Council now held by
                                Syria which the latter is vacating this coming fall. He pointed out
                                that Asia had only two seats on the Security Council, one held by
                                China, a permanent member, and the other having been passed from one
                                Islamic nation to another. He felt that the time had come for India
                                to be the second Asian member and hoped that the United States would
                                be inclined to support India’s candidacy, particularly in view of
                                our backing of India against the Ukraine last fall. Mr. Henderson
                                said that Sir Girja had presented a good argument and that we would
                                give very serious consideration to India’s claim.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja indicated some resentment at the fact that Secretary Royall
                                of the Army Department had not received him despite the prearranged
                                appointment at 4:15. Secretary Royall had been tied up in an urgent
                                press conference. Mr. Henderson expressed his regret to Sir <pb
                                    n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0520"/>Girja and subsequently
                                called Secretary Royall and suggested that he might wish to have
                                some message sent to Sir Girja at the Indian Embassy.</p>

                            <p>Sir Girja called at 5:30 at his request. He said that he had come to
                                the US as a member of the Indian Special Delegation to the <gloss
                                    target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> in the Kashmir case. I asked how the
                                Kashmir situation was developing. Sir Girja replied that in Kashmir
                                itself the Indian military position had improved and with the coming
                                spring, Indian troops, totalling only slightly more than a division,
                                would be able to move more vigorously against a few remaining
                                trouble spots. According to latest Indian military reports, tribal
                                invaders still comprised about 60% of the opposing forces, the
                                remaining 40% being indigenous insurgents.</p>
                            <p>Turning to the <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> aspect of the
                                Kashmir situation, Sir Girja said that the fundamental differences
                                between India and Pakistan related to the introduction of Pakistan
                                troops into Kashmir and the composition of the interim government of
                                the State. India could not accede to Pakistan’s demand that the
                                latter’s troops move into Kashmir territory in order to keep the
                                tribal invaders out. The plebiscite when held would result in a very
                                close vote, and if India won, Pakistan forces might not withdraw and
                                would almost certainly not effectively resist the re-entry of tribal
                                elements. With respect to the interim government, Pakistan was
                                insisting that Abdullah<note n="1" xml:id="d404fn1">Sheikh Mohammed
                                    Abdullah, Prime Minister of the State of Jammu and
                                    Kashmir.</note> be removed as Prime Minister and that a
                                coalition government be formed. Sir Girja felt that there was no one
                                to replace Abdullah, and that a coalition of groups whose aims were
                                completely divergent could only result in a paralysis of government
                                and administration in the State.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja then said that although he appreciated my interest, he had
                                not intended to trouble me with the Kashmir problem. His real
                                purpose in coming to Washington had been to explain to me and other
                                US officials India’s position vis-à-vis the US and the USSR. He had
                                the impression that there was a feeling in this country that India
                                was <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0521"/>somehow “in the Russian
                                camp”. He wished to emphasize that this was not the case, as India
                                had not rid itself of the British in order to accept domination from
                                some other quarter. I commented that although irresponsible
                                newspaper columnists might have speculated on the nature of India’s
                                relations with the USSR, I was sure that there was in the US no
                                informed opinion that India had aligned itself with the Russians.
                                Sir Girja expressed his gratification at my statement and pointed
                                out that two fundamental considerations prevented Indian adherence
                                to the Soviet bloc. First, through its association with the British,
                                unhappy as it had been in some aspects, India had acquired the
                                ideals of democracy and individual liberty which were held by the US
                                and other nations of the west. Second, India can expect no effective
                                assistance from the USSR in its primary objective of developing and
                                strengthening itself economically and militarily. In fact, the US is
                                the only country which is in a position to aid India. I told Sir
                                Girja that we were very grateful to receive his assurances of the
                                friendly disposition of his Government.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja stated that his remarks were being made with the full
                                knowledge and authorization of Prime Minister Nehru, and that he
                                hoped that the Prime Minister could himself visit the US in the not
                                too distant future in order further to clarify the Indian position.
                                I said that we would be delighted to receive Prime Minister Nehru,
                                adding, however, that Sir Girja had himself very effectively stated
                                his Government’s views.</p>
                            <p>Sir Girja then pointed out that although India was maintaining an
                                army of some 360,000 men and had appropriated 121 crores of rupees
                                ($363,000,000) for defense purposes, it was in no position
                                effectively to resist aggression from the north, and that the <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> could not risk an open declaration
                                of its anti-USSR views. The strengthening of India’s military power
                                was of the highest importance, and he would like to send a military
                                mission to the US at an early date to explore the possibilities of
                                obtaining equipment, particularly as the US was about to step up its
                                own armament program. I said that before a mission was sent it would
                                be advisable for us to have some preliminary discussions to clarify
                                India’s wants and to examine the possibilities of supplying them
                                from this country. I added that our production theory and practice
                                involved a sacrifice of immediate small output for a “tooled”
                                longer-term mass output, and cited examples from our experience in
                                World War II. I pointed out that if an Indian military mission came
                                to this country, it should be charged with studying American
                                production techniques in order that some of these might be
                                introduced in Indian ordnance factories. Sir Girja assented, but
                                emphasized that the first objective of the mission would be
                                procurement, and after that objective had been achieved, the mission
                                could <pb n="508" xml:id="pg_508" facs="0522"/>turn to the matter of
                                improving Indian techniques. I replied that in view of the
                                importance of repair and maintenance, I would hope that the two
                                matters could be pursued simultaneously. Sir Girja agreed that this
                                would be desirable.</p>
                            <p>In conclusion, Sir Girja observed that Syria would be leaving the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> next fall and that he hoped
                                India might be considered for this seat. India, the second largest
                                nation in Asia, had not yet been a <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>
                                member, and although he appreciated the circumstances which had led
                                the US to support Islamic states for the second Asian place on the
                                    <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss>, China holding the first as a
                                permanent member, he felt that the time might have come when India’s
                                claim could be given serious consideration, particularly in view of
                                our support of India against the Ukraine last fall. I commented that
                                Sir Girja made a strong case for India, and suggested that he
                                discuss this matter with Mr. Henderson. (Sir Girja did subsequently
                                mention India’s desire for a <gloss target="#t_SC1">SC</gloss> seat
                                to Mr. Henderson).</p>

                            <p>Mr. Chopra initiated the discussion by saying that the Embassy of
                                India would very much appreciate receiving informal information as
                                to whether the U.S. Government felt as did the Indian Government
                                that this would be an appropriate time to initiate a review of the
                                general situation in the relations between the two nations with
                                particular emphasis on the exchange of military information and
                                technical training. He said that in the event such indication should
                                prove favorable a formal approach could be made at the Department’s
                                convenience but that in the event that the United States felt this
                                not to be an appropriate time would it be possible for an assurance
                                informally of maximum cooperation within limitations imposed by the
                                situation to be given by the United States.</p>
                            <p>In discussing the question of India’s interest in the United States
                                Chopra said that following the “unfortunate affair of the airplanes”
                                in January (at which time a request for military planes and
                                equipment was turned down by the Department because of the Kashmir
                                developments) India had gone to the British with their problem. They
                                    <pb n="509" xml:id="pg_509" facs="0523"/>had been
                                sympathetically received and certain arrangements had been worked
                                out but the truth of the matter was that the British simply did not
                                possess the facilities for training, information exchange, or
                                equipment supply which the United States has.</p>
                            <p>Chopra explained that prior to August 15, 1947, and the establishment
                                of separate Dominion status, India had not had any trouble receiving
                                automatically all the information which could be utilized, by the
                                military. The British had received this information from the United
                                States through the Joint Chiefs of Staff and it had been
                                automatically passed on to, or available to, the Indian military
                                schools and the Indian Government. Following August 15, however,
                                this source had been completely cut off with the explanation from
                                the British that under their understanding with the United States
                                such information could not be made available by the British to any
                                third country–even a Dominion.</p>
                            <p>As have various other personal, informal, official representatives of
                                the Indian Government during recent months, Mr. Chopra stated
                                parenthetically that, despite public statements made by Indian
                                Government leaders for domestic consumption, there is no doubt at
                                all as to which side India would take should there be a third world
                                war—the United States could count absolutely on having India at its
                                side in such a conflict.</p>
                            <p>The specific incident which had caused him to approach the Department
                                on this occasion was explained by Mr. Chopra as being the receipt of
                                a telegram from the Government of India to the effect that Colonel
                                Middleton, American Military Attaché, New Delhi, had asked the
                                Government of India for the following information, all of which is

                            <p>Mr. Sparks was shown a copy of this telegram which concluded with a
                                paragraph to the effect that Colonel Middleton had been informed
                                that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> had no objection to
                                making this information available to the U.S. should it be
                                understood that such release would be made upon a reciprocal basis.
                                The telegram was marked for the attention of Brigadier Chaudhuri and
                                instructed him to approach the India Desk on the subject “with
                                tact”.</p>
                            <p>In response to a question as to what Brigadier Chaudhuri’s experience
                                so far had been in requesting information which he desired from the
                                U.S. military, Mr. Sparks was informed that (<hi rend="italic"
                                    >a</hi>) few questions had been asked because of the general
                                atmosphere following the January episode involving Colonel Kaul,
                                    (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) all questions which had been asked,
                                with the exception of one set referred to the Air Force, had been
                                satisfactorily answered, (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) no questions of
                                the nature of those put by Colonel Middleton had been asked though
                                    <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> in view of its problem of

                                    rend="italic">d</hi>) it appeared that India would lose at least
                                one and possibly both of the two positions it had enjoyed in the
                                past in the Fort Leavenworth training program, apparently through no
                                fault of India’s other than becoming an independent country.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chopra reiterated that the <gloss target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss>
                                had nothing in the way of information which it wished to conceal
                                from the United States with which it desired the closest
                                understanding and cooperation. India was only interested in the
                                exchange of information becoming a two way street.</p>
                            <p>In subsequent conversation on unrelated matters Mr. Chopra twice
                                referred to a new “era of good feeling and friendly, full,
                                understanding” which he so fervently hopes can now be inaugurated
                                between India and the United States.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chopra telephoned later in the afternoon to inform me that the
                                Indian Embassy had just received a second telegram from the
                                Government of India in which it was stated that the American Air
                                Attaché in New Delhi had officially requested the Government of
                                India to supply him with a complete survey of the airfields in India
                                showing their types and classifications with maps, locations, and
                                with detailed analysis of the disposition of facilities and the
                                planned order of battle.</p>

                            <p>Mr. Hare opened the conversation by referring to the informal talk of
                                May 10 which Mr. Chopra and Brigadier Chaudhuri had had with Mr.
                                Sparks on the subject of the exchange of military information
                                between India and the United States. He expressed his appreciation
                                and approval of the Embassy’s approach to the Department at least in
                                the preliminary stages of the solving of specific problems at what
                                might be termed the “operating level”. Mr. Hare pointed out that
                                results satisfactory to both nations in the gradual growth and
                                strengthening of bi-lateral relations were often achieved by
                                following the procedure which had been utilized by the Indian
                                Embassy in this case. He then asked Mr. Sparks to report on the
                                results of the conversations which had been held with the Army.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Sparks explained that following the meeting of May 10 he and Mr.
                                Thurston held exploratory discussions with Army authorities and that
                                they had been very gratified by the warmth of their reception and
                                the extent of the genuine interest of the Army in India. He said
                                that Mr. Thurston and he had explained the Government of India’s
                                reaction to the requests for detailed military information which had
                                been made by the American Military and Air Attachés in New Delhi and
                                that the Army authorities felt this reaction to be highly reasonable
                                and were prepared at any time to give Brigadier Chaudhuri similar
                                information to that which had been requested of the Indian
                                Government. The Army was not only prepared to make such information
                                available but had already given considerable information to Mr.
                                Vesugar, former Chief of the India Supply Mission, concerning the
                                National Guard of the United States. In the future they would make
                                information available only to Brigadier Chaudhuri. Mr. Chopra and
                                Brigadier Chaudhuri agreed that Brigadier Chaudhuri would call upon
                                Colonel Francis Graling, Chief of the Foreign Liaison Branch, in the
                                near future and would subsequently call upon Colonel Graling’s
                                opposite number in the Air Forces, Colonel Louis W. Proper. It was
                                apparent that both Mr. Chopra and Brigadier Chaudhuri were fully
                                satisfied by this portion of the conversation.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hare said that he understood that Mr. Chopra had suggested to Mr.
                                Sparks on May 10 the possible initiation of a review of general <pb
                                    n="512" xml:id="pg_512" facs="0526"/>Indo-American relations. He
                                asked Mr. Chopra what the nature of the review he had had in mind
                                might be.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Chopra responded that the Embassy of India was particularly
                                interested in establishing a procedural approach which would be
                                effective for the treatment of individual problems as they arose. In
                                this connection he mentioned specifically Mr. Nehru’s experience in
                                talking with Mr. Henderson last week which he quoted Mr. Nehru<note
                                    n="1" xml:id="d406fn1">R. K. Nehru, Indian Minister in
                                    Washington.</note> as describing as “the most satisfactory
                                experience which I have had since arriving in Washington”.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Hare said that in his opinion the Embassy had made an effective
                                type of approach on the current question of the exchange of military
                                information which had been resolved so happily. He said that both he
                                and Mr. Sparks held themselves ready at all times for discussions of
                                any problems which arose. He further explained that the basic
                                endeavors of the U.S. Government in international relations today
                                are to contribute to the creation of world wide conditions in which
                                the Charter of the United Nations can function effectively; and
                                added that it is particulary gratifying that India’s basic endeavors
                                are directed along the same lines.</p>
                            <p>In ensuing general discussion Mr. Hare observed that, because of the
                                multitudinous aspects of our over-all relations, the American
                                Government had not found it practicable in the past to conduct
                                comprehensive over-all discussions of bilateral relations. In
                                addition, he pointed out that, in any event, it would in all
                                probability be undesirable to attempt to establish a formal
                                blueprint of relations inasmuch as such a blueprint would imply
                                detailed implementation, and possible failures of implementation in
                                unpredictable circumstances might result in negation of the original
                                desire to solidify relations. He cited as an example that, as close
                                and friendly as American relations have traditionally been with the
                                Government of Canada, we have never held comprehensive discussions
                                of over-all policy but have dealt with each problem as it arose
                                using as background the broad understanding and communities of
                                interest which existed between the two countries. In this connection
                                Mr. Hare said that in his opinion the same type of broad
                                understanding and communities of interest existed between the people
                                of America and the people of India and their governments, and that
                                this had become apparent in numerous discussions such as those
                                between Mr. Henderson, Mr. Lovett, and Sir Girja Bajpai during Sir
                                Girja’s recent visit to the United States.</p>
                            <p>The conversation terminated with an expression by Mr. Chopra of his
                                appreciation for the frankness which had characterized it and his
                                satisfaction with its results. He indicated that he was in complete

                            <p>At our request Mr. Nehru and Brigadier Chaudhuri called to receive
                                the Department’s answer to Mr. Chopra’s informal request of June
                                    7<note n="1" xml:id="d407fn1">A memorandum dated June 7, 1948,
                                    covering this conversation between Messrs. Chopra, Hare, and
                                    Sparks, is filed in the records of the Department of State under
                                    845.24/6–748.</note> as to the probable reaction of the United
                                States Government to a formal request from the Government of India
                                to import arms and ammunition from the United States to be utilized
                                exclusively in the Indian military training program.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Mathews said that he was sorry that so much time had been
                                required to prepare an answer but explained that the Indian request
                                had been given very careful consideration not only in the Department
                                of State but in other interested Departments as well. He said that
                                although we very much regretted the necessity of responding
                                negatively to the Indian approach it had become clear in a close
                                examination of the specific items requested by the Embassy that
                                despite the Government of India’s willingness to provide the United
                                States with an undertaking that the items would be used for training
                                purposes exclusively, the export of live ammunition of any type from
                                the United States to India at this time would result in an immediate
                                and commensurate increase in the Government of India’s military
                                potential. The receipt of more than 12,000,000 rounds of ammunition
                                would release a commensurate amount for combat purposes even if the
                                specific rounds received were not so utilized. Mr. Mathews concluded
                                that such an increased military potential from American sources
                                would be in violation of the current United States policy. He
                                explained, however, that this refusal did not prejudice any future
                                requests which the <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0528"
                                />Government of India might wish to make—all of which would be given
                                serious consideration by the Department.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Nehru and Brigadier Chaudhuri were deeply disappointed by the
                                Department’s decision, and although they did not question the
                                accuracy of including the items which they had requested within the
                                framework of the over-all policy, they did attack this policy and
                                asked whether the time had not come when the policy as a whole could
                                be reconsidered. Mr. Mathews reviewed the history of the development
                                of the policy and explained that it had been adopted reluctantly by
                                the United States only as a result of the unstable situation
                                existing between the Governments of India and Pakistan, the
                                submission of the Kashmir problem to the Security Council, and the
                                actual requests for assistance in military supplies received
                                concomitantly from both Governments last January when the Kashmir
                                developments were at their most serious peak. When Mr. Nehru
                                objected that relations between Pakistan and India might for one
                                cause or another be difficult for some time to come and that what he
                                had always understood to be a temporary policy on the part of the
                                American Government would thus in effect become a long term policy,
                                Mr. Mathews said that he sincerely hoped, and knew that the
                                Government of India hoped, that such would not be the case and that
                                India and Pakistan would be able to find their way to an amicable
                                relationship in the near future. At any rate, he explained, the
                                Department of State could not feel justified at the present time in
                                recommending a reconsideration of the overall policy so long as the
                                situation which caused its original adoption continued substantially
                                unaltered. On two different occasions during the discussion Mr.
                                Nehru repeated his question as to whether “exactly the same policy”
                                applied to Pakistan as to India. He was assured that it did.</p>

                            <p>863. Bajpai during course of conversation today asked how long the

                                him Embassy had no definite information that point. Bajpai then said
                                that “since the Prime Minister would not be able to visit the US for
                                some time” the Prime Minister hoped it might be possible to see the

                            <p>Bajpai said no definite appointment could be made this time as many
                                factors might affect Prune Minister’s plans but it was clear from
                                his remarks that Prime Minister is desirous meeting Secretary in

                            <p>US is criticized in India for not rendering more financial and
                                technical assistance, yet American businessmen receive no
                                encouragement to invest and any suggestion of American aid or
                                investment is widely criticized as extension American imperialism.
                                While Embassy does not consider this occasion appropriate for
                                raising foregoing question, it is mentioned since Prime Minister
                                might bring up this topic which would give Secretary opportunity

                            <p>Majority position Western powers in UN is widely regarded as US
                                majority completely subject to US control. Cabinet Minister close to

                                protect it from US majority because minority rights must be
                                protected. Attempt could be made convince Nehru majority position

                                and that will of majority should not be continuously thwarted by

                            <p>Soviet propaganda, widely accepted here, proclaims US is endangering
                                peace of world with threat of another terrible war. Opportunity
                                might be utilized emphasize threat comes from USSR, that it extends
                                not only to Western powers, but to India and all Southeast Asia.

                            <p>However, US policy regarding nationalist movements in Southeast Asian
                                colonial countries is subjected to strong criticism by Indians, who
                                do not understand why, in view our widely proclaimed beliefs in
                                freedom and democracy, we do not lend active support to nationalist
                                movements rather than assisting European powers, namely, French and

                                movements. Indians are perturbed by Communist uprisings, but believe
                                that basically they stem from suppression and exploitation of masses
                                by European powers and “foreign vested interests”.</p>
                            <p>Belief is widely held here US favors Pakistan over India because US

                                although he made no general statement on basic position India
                                towards USSR or US, it was clear that Nehru recognizes interaction
                                of Soviet policy and world Communism. Tone of meeting was friendly,
                                even cordial, but on Nehru’s side, at times guarded and occasionally
                                defensive. It unquestionably afforded three Indians present most

                            <p>Nehru appeared accept thesis rehabilitation Western Europe important
                                Asia as well as Europe but made no comment on our stated objective
                                preventing further spread police states. Instead he questioned
                                Secretary rather insistently on why Soviets deliberately alienated
                                US public opinion and what were their real objectives. He himself
                                suggested USSR was suspicious of US and after eliciting analysis of
                                warmongering charge, even asked Secretary what he thought of
                                reported advocacy of preventive war by some Americans. Except for
                                evident interest he gave no sign his reaction Secretary’s outline
                                importance atomic bomb as deterrent Soviet action.</p>
                            <p>Nehru spoke at some length on subject Communism in India and
                                Southeast Asia. He developed thesis that British need for popular
                                support when they took India into war led them to support Communists
                                in spite of paradox that Communists condemned war until Soviet
                                entry. British support thus aided Communists to become sizeable
                                group for first time. Then temporary community of interest between
                                nationalists and revolutionary Communists (i.e. to rid India of
                                Britain) aided Communist cause but in general elections Indian
                                voters repudiated Communists because they served Moscow, not India.
                                At present Nehru said government experiencing no difficulty in
                                suppressing Communists in India. Seemingly also he was not deeply
                                concerned re Communists in neighboring areas as he glossed over
                                Burma situation lightly and hazarded view that Indonesia Republic
                                would be able to deal with Communist threat adequately in future.
                                There, he said, situation had been aggravated by Dutch stubbornness
                                and referred to reports of support Dutch received from US, a remark
                                which Secretary later referred to saying we were pressing Dutch most
                                insistently to modify their attitude.</p>
                            <p>Re Communism, Secretary mentioned dangerous situation Latin America
                                with wealthy crust on top and little else but mass of poor. Nehru
                                seemed to catch parallel with India but preferred dwell on social
                                and economic objectives his Government.</p>
                            <p>During his initial lengthy review world situation which he said was
                                further complicated by difficult local issues, Secretary referred to
                                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0532"/>Kashmir as one such
                                issue which disturbed US greatly. He expressed hope twice that India
                                and Pakistan would earnestly attempt to settle this matter as
                                quickly as possible. Nehru adverted to this later and after saying
                                that regarding Kashmir he had legitimate grievance, launched into
                                rather gratuitous fifteen minute ex parte review case reminiscent

                                threats to march to Delhi. He asserted without qualification that
                                India had accepted <gloss target="#t_UNCIP1">UNCIP</gloss>
                                resolution whereas Pakistan had rejected it. He insisted Indian

                                conversation he reverted to Kashmir case in more moderate vein and
                                said hoped some solution could be worked out.</p>
                            <p>There was no reference this connection to London or British
                                Commonwealth. We did not gain impression that Nehru contemplating

                            <p>Secretary at one time alluded to charges of American imperialism
                                mentioned New Delhi telegram 890, September 29, and later used Latin
                                America again as parallel to point out how under-developed area
                                needing US capital did” not offer favorable conditions because of

                                government loans much more likely to form basis for charge of
                                imperialism than private. Nehru ascribed charges of imperialism to

                                dominance in foreign field, already very powerful, constantly

                                In his reply Nehru struck fairly responsive note despite apparent
                                dissatisfaction with UN action in cases of direct interest to India.
                                However, Nehru said India would support UN though it had weaknesses
                                since it was only hope of world and must be supported. Nehru also
                                said he was in full accord in condemning use of deceit and force but
                                that it was also necessary to be firm but generous. He did recognize
                                that, although another war would be horrible in its consequences, a
                                nation could not sacrifice its interest and principles simply
                                because of <pb n="519" xml:id="pg_519" facs="0533"/>fear of the
                                horror. If a nation did so it would simply be sacrificing without
                                contest the honor and principles it should have tried to protect.
                                Towards close of talk he stated he well aware of India’s
                                responsibility to develop its economy and society and that in
                                working for itself India was working for Asia, especially in view
                                tragic situation in China. He also dwelt on close friendly relations
                                India enjoyed with Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia and way in which these
                                countries sometimes solicited and accepted Indian advice. Perhaps he
                                did this to counter Pakistan charges India was aggressive
                                neighbor.</p>
                            <p>Despite its general character, we feel conversation was important
                                step in evolution closer, more understanding relationship US and
                                India and that Indians present were impressed with character,
                                sincerity, and purpose US policy. Moreover, Secretary’s frankness
                                and time he gave to interview must have been very pleasing. Although
                                Nehru was entertaining British delegation at 7:30, he did not take
                                leave of Secretary till 7:45. [Kopper and Parsons.]</p>

                            <p>1108. During talk with Bajpai December 21, I asked regarding <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> reaction events in China. He said
                                that although India did not believe it would be sharply affected in
                                immediate future by Communist victory, it was somewhat concerned at
                                possible ultimate consequences. A Communist China might lead to
                                establishment series of other Communist Asiatic states and to
                                strengthening Communist forces throughout South East Asia. <gloss
                                    target="#t_GOI1">GOI</gloss> felt that unless there should be
                                considerable deterioration in Indian economic conditions, it could
                                keep Indian Communist movement under control. Plans for Indian
                                economic development were being speeded up in hope of checking
                                inflation and improving living standards.</p>
                            <p>Both Governor General<note n="2" xml:id="d412fn2">Chakravarti
                                    Rajagopalachari, who assumed office June 21, 1948.</note> and
                                Nehru, in conversations during last few days seemed even less
                                concerned at Chinese developments. Both appeared confident of
                                Communist victory in China but expressed view that a Communist China
                                would not necessarily be dominated by Soviet Union. Governor General
                                went so far as to say that China under Communist control would
                                probably be more Asiatic and anti-Western and might therefore be
                                more cooperative with India than Kuomintang China, which had
                                contrived “to survive so long only because of its support from
                                without”.</p>

                            <p>In general I find a certain smugness in Indian government circles
                                regarding China. There is apparently feeling that China is destined
                                to disappear for some time as a world force leaving India as the
                                foremost Asiatic power, courted on one side by capitalistic powers
                                of the West and on the other by Communist powers of Eastern Europe
                                and Asia.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>The recent general election brought to power a Nationalist Government
                                composed of the Nationalist and Afrikaner parties and representing
                                primarily the Afrikaner element of the population. The new
                                government is narrowly racialist both in its attitude toward the
                                colored problem in South Africa, and also in its identification of
                                the Afrikaner culture with the South African nation. While these
                                racialist ideas, particularly as they relate to the relations
                                between the English speaking and Afrikaans speaking sections of
                                South Africa, may no longer claim the full allegiance of more
                                enlightened Nationalist leaders, the basic strength of the
                                Nationalist Party rests firmly on the reactionary rural areas which
                                for the foreseeable future will continue to regard the English
                                element in South Africa as the enemy of the Afrikaner <hi
                                    rend="italic">Volk</hi>. The Afrikaner Party, which is generally
                                considered to be more moderate than the Nationalist Party and to
                                offer a possible vehicle for Afrikaner-English political
                                collaboration, is moderate only in its leadership. The rank and file
                                membership of the Afrikaner Party today is made up in large part of
                                members of the extremist nationalist organization, the
                                Ossewabrandwag. The close numerical division of the population of
                                South Africa between Afrikaners and persons of British stock, and
                                the virtual certainty that an effort on the part of the Nationalist
                                Government to fasten an Afrikaner hegemony on the country by
                                undemocratic means would lead to civil strife, provide the most
                                effective check on precipitate action by the new government.</p>
                            <p>Legislative restrictions in racial matters in South Africa, such as
                                regulations regarding native residence, pass laws, and the color bar
                                in industry, have always been more rigid on the books than in
                                administrative application, and, in fact, in many localities have
                                not been strictly enforced. The present government can be expected
                                to promote a harsher administrative application of existing laws
                                quite apart from any further restrictions which may be
                                instituted.</p>
                            <p>There are no natives in the House of Assembly or the Senate although
                                they comprise 80% of the population. The sole representation <pb
                                    n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0540"/>of this large segment of
                                the population is through three European members in the House of
                                Assembly and four in the Senate. The Nationalist Government,
                                however, opposes the continuance of this representation in the House
                                of Assembly and can be expected to take steps to eliminate it as
                                soon as a constitutional formula can be devised for doing so without
                                the necessity of a two-thirds vote of Parliament.</p>
                            <p>The Indian problem in Natal, which has involved the South African
                                Government in a dispute with India, provides a link between what is
                                a South African internal problem, the question of race relations,
                                and South African foreign policy. The South African Government
                                failed under General Smuts to implement the General Assembly
                                Resolution of December 1946 concerning this dispute, which recorded
                                the opinion that the treatment of the Indians should be in
                                conformity with international obligations under agreements between
                                India and South Africa and under the UN Charter, and requested the
                                two governments to report to the next General Assembly the measures
                                adopted to this effect. The problem was again considered at the 1947
                                session of the General Assembly with no definitive results. The
                                present government is even more blunt in insisting that the question
                                of the treatment of Indians in South Africa is a matter of domestic
                                sovereignty outside the jurisdiction of the UN. Not only is the
                                Nationalist Government intransigent in its opposition to removing
                                present legislation restricting the residence and ownership of
                                property by the Indians, but it has taken action which further
                                restricts and discriminates against Indians. The Nationalist
                                Government has indicated that it favors repatriation as a solution
                                of the Indian minority problem and has indicated a willingness to
                                discuss the matter with India on this basis. However, this is not
                                acceptable to the Government of India and, in any event, the
                                repatriation of any significant numbers of Indians would be strongly
                                opposed by the South African Indians themselves. The matter is again
                                before the General Assembly, although there is little hope that an
                                early and final solution can be reached.</p>
                            <p>The US position on this question has consistently been based upon the
                                view that the solution of the Indian problem must lie in an amicable
                                settlement between the parties, and that, in view of certain legal
                                doubts as to the international status of the problem, the question
                                as to whether the treatment of Indians is within the domestic
                                jurisdiction of South Africa should be referred to the International
                                Court of Justice. It is our policy to avoid being drawn directly
                                into discussion of South Africa’s racial problems. Nevertheless,
                                whenever our own racial problems are prominently publicized in South
                                Africa the Legation should rebut, through <gloss target="#t_USIE1"
                                    >USIE</gloss> channels or otherwise, the distortions and
                                exaggerations which are often featured in foreign comment on this
                                subject.</p>
                            <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0541"/>
                            <p>South Africa’s continued refusal to submit a trusteeship agreement
                                for South-West Africa has also brought her into conflict with the
                                UN. South Africa feels that after faithfully administering the
                                territory for many years the mandate should be terminated and the
                                territory incorporated into the Union. In this connection, the
                                government considers that it has the support of the people of the
                                Union, the white inhabitants of South-West Africa, and a majority of
                                the natives in the territory. Our position is that the Union
                                Government is under a moral but not a legal obligation to submit a
                                trusteeship agreement for South-West Africa. In view of the
                                continued failure of South Africa to submit such an agreement, which
                                has been twice requested by the General Assembly, our policy is to
                                attempt to continue the present <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> in
                                preference to a line of action which might cause the Union
                                Government to cease reporting on or to annex the territory, as it
                                might do if severely criticized. As a matter of tactics, the
                                implementation of this policy requires careful handling—on the one
                                hand to endeavor, to moderate the strongly critical tone taken by
                                other delegations, and on the other, to avoid being placed in a
                                position of appearing to defend the Union of South Africa against
                                the majority of the Assembly.</p>

                                with neighboring territories, particularly the Rhodesias. It is too
                                early to determine what expression the new government will give to
                                the idea of Pan-Africanism. The Nationalist Government has already
                                evidenced a sensitivity to developments in neighboring African
                                territories. Examples of this are the hostile reaction of the
                                Nationalist press to suggestions that Great Britain may endeavor to
                                counter-balance the loss of the Indian Army by building up a native
                                force in Africa and the Nationalist desire eventually to acquire the
                                British High Commission territories. In view of the unenlightened
                                Nationalist approach to race problems and the danger which this
                                attitude presents to the future of South Africa itself we should be
                                particularly alert to any manifestation of an expansionist policy by
                                the present South African Government.</p>

                            <p>South Africa’s economic relations with the United States have been
                                characterized by a large and growing volume of trade in which South
                                Africa normally utilizes the output of her gold mines to balance an
                                import surplus in other commodities with this country. In the last
                                eighteen months South Africa has incurred a heavy dollar deficit
                                which has been reflected in a serious depletion of its gold
                                reserves. The deficit <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0542"/>has
                                been caused largely by a heavy increase in imports from the dollar
                                area unmatched by a corresponding increase in exports. The factors
                                chiefly responsible for this development are: (1) a large increase
                                in money incomes, due to an excessive growth of bank credit and an
                                abnormal influx of capital from the United Kingdom, which the Union
                                Government has so far failed to offset by strong
                                counter-inflationary measures; (2) the need to replenish depleted
                                inventories and satisfy demands pent up during the war years; (3) an
                                adverse shift in the Union’s terms of trade resulting from roughly a
                                doubling of its import prices as against the maintenance of an
                                internationally fixed price for its chief export—gold.</p>
                            <p>This situation has led to an informal request by South Africa for an
                                Export-Import Bank loan. In submitting this request, the Union
                                Government has indicated that it regards import or exchange
                                restrictions as the chief alternatives to receiving financial
                                assistance from this country.<note n="3" xml:id="d413fn3">By

                                    Cabinet considered plans for import control. The following day
                                    the Minister of Finance issued a statement explaining the

                            <p>During the general election campaign the Nationalist Party repeatedly
                                stated that the constitutional relationship of South Africa to the
                                British Commonwealth was not an issue, and that no change in the
                                constitutional arrangements would be made without a specific mandate
                                from the electorate. There is no reason to believe that this pledge
                                will be violated. Nevertheless, there is every indication that
                                Commonwealth ties will be weakened in that cooperation on any
                                specific matter will be undertaken only after it has been determined
                                that such cooperation is in the interests of South Africa. This
                                moderate attitude on the part of the Republican-minded Nationalists
                                may be explained in large part in terms of fear of Communist
                                aggression and the dangers which it presents to the maintenance of
                                white supremacy in southern Africa. As a result of recent
                                developments in relations between the Soviet Union and the west the
                                South African military authorities have decided to utilize British
                                instructors in the South African armed forces, to render assistance
                                to the British in the Berlin airlift, and to have the South African
                                navy participate in maneuvers of the British South Atlantic
                                fleet.</p>

                            <p>After indicating that lie would not participate in the Commonwealth
                                Conference of Prime Ministers at London during October, the South
                                African Prime Minister permitted one of his Cabinet Ministers to
                                attend the meetings. It remains to be seen whether the drift away
                                from military collaboration with the United Kingdom, which has been
                                going on since the end of the war and which has been accelerated in
                                recent months, will be reversed or at least checked as a result of
                                the present state of international relations.</p>
                            <p>Because of her remoteness from the main currents of international
                                politics, South Africa has never been greatly concerned with the
                                development of a well defined foreign policy covering her relations
                                with other states outside the African continent. During the Smuts
                                regime the South African Government displayed a friendly sympathy
                                toward Greece which was largely explained by the personal friendship
                                of General Smuts with members of the Greek royal family. The Smuts
                                Government also appeared more sympathetic than was public opinion
                                toward the rehabilitation of Italy. The Nationalist Government has
                                no reason to share either of these two attitudes.</p>
                            <p>South Africa opposed the adoption of the General Assembly Resolution
                                of December 12, 1946, concerning Spain, on the grounds that it was
                                an interference in the domestic affairs of the Spanish people. This
                                position has recently been reaffirmed. Its attitude on this
                                question, it should be pointed out, does not represent so much
                                sympathy with the Spanish Government as opposition to what South
                                Africa considers unwarranted interference by the United Nations in
                                domestic affairs.</p>
                            <p>The South African Government alone among the members of the British
                                Commonwealth failed to recognize the Polish Government when it was
                                constituted at Warsaw. This policy again reflects a personal bias in
                                that it can be explained by the esteem in which representatives of
                                the former Polish Government at London were held by South African
                                officials, including General Smuts. It is unlikely that the present
                                government, which is so outspoken in its opposition to communism,
                                will reverse this policy by according recognition to the Polish
                                Government.</p>
                            <p>South Africa has become increasingly aware of the dangers which
                                Communist propaganda presents to the maintenance of its social
                                structure based as it is on the dominance of a large colored
                                population by a small white minority. The USSR maintains consulates
                                at Pretoria and Capetown, but the desire of the Soviet Government to
                                exchange diplomatic missions with South Africa was ignored by the
                                Smuts Government and can expect no greater consideration from the
                                present regime. The size of the Soviet representation in South
                                Africa is disproportionately large considering the insignificant
                                volume of <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0545"/>trade between the
                                two countries. The Nationalist Party, when in opposition, frequently
                                questioned the government on the number of Russian representatives
                                serving in South Africa and can be expected to oppose any further
                                expansion of personnel or activities. We may count on a sympathetic
                                reception in South Africa of our firm opposition to Soviet
                                expansionism and Communist fifth-columns.</p>

                            <p>The role of the native in South Africa is the omnipresent issue
                                involving the major parties and affecting almost every aspect of
                                South African life. The question of race relations was a paramount
                                issue in the recent general election and the effectiveness of the
                                Nationalist appeal to the fears of the electorate demonstrates only
                                too clearly that a substantial section of the white population place
                                their reliance in repression as the answer to the problem which
                                plagues them. South Africa by reason of the resources both human and
                                material which she possesses should have great potentialities for
                                further development. Unless, however, her color policy can be
                                developed on something other than a substratum of fear and hate her
                                progress will be hampered and the development which she has already
                                achieved will be endangered. A practical demonstration of this fact
                                is afforded by the uncertain future of secondary industry. Until
                                such time as the purchasing power of her eight million natives is
                                raised the smallness of her domestic market will make it difficult
                                for South Africa to compete in neighboring African territories with
                                mass produced articles manufactured elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>The jealous concern of the present Nationalist Government to preserve
                                the culture of the Afrikaner <hi rend="italic">Volk</hi> has already
                                led to a reversal of the policy of encouraging immigration which was
                                adopted by the previous government. The check on immigration is
                                explained on the ground that the ethnical proportions of the white
                                South African population must not be altered—in other words that the
                                numerical superiority of the Afrikaners might be destroyed by
                                unlimited immigration. These racialist ideas, by denying South
                                Africa the services of artisans and others who would assist in the
                                development of the country, act as a brake on progress.</p>
                            <p>Our relations with South Africa are friendly both because South
                                Africans in general like Americans and feel a kinship with them and
                                also for the purely negative reason that anti-British feeling can be
                                expressed indirectly by the Nationalist Government through closer
                                ties with the United States. We welcome friendly relations with
                                South Africa because of strategic considerations and also because
                                South Africa represents an increasingly good market for our
                                products. <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0546"/>While of course
                                we are not concerned with what alterations may be effected in South
                                Africa’s constitutional relations with Great Britain, our interests
                                would not be served by a South Africa withdrawn for all practical
                                purposes from association in the British Commonwealth, particularly
                                if such withdrawal were accompanied by a policy of narrow
                                nationalism and isolation. Our policy should recognize the
                                immaturity and lack of experience in international affairs of many
                                of the leaders and supporters of the present government and should
                                endeavor by the exercise of patience to encourage South Africa to
                                continue her cooperation with other countries, and particularly her
                                participation in the United Nations.</p>
