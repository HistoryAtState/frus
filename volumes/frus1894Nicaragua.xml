                    <p>The Secretary of State, to whom was referred a resolution adopted by the
                        Senate on the 4th ultimo, requesting the President, “if not incompatible
                        with public interest, to send to the Senate any reports or correspondence
                        relating to affairs at Bluefields, in the Mosquito Territory; and also to
                        inform the Senate whether any American citizens have been arrested or the
                        rights of any American citizens at Blue-fields have been interfered with
                        during the past two years by the Government of Nicaragua,” has the honor to
                        submit the correspondence called for, that the same may be transmitted to
                        the Senate should the President deem it compatible with the public interest
                        to do so.</p>
                    <p>Although the resolution covers affairs at Bluefields during the past two
                        years, the events to which it relates occurred within the last twelve
                        months.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="pg_2" facs="0009"/>
                    <p>In December, 1893, war broke out between Nicaragua and Honduras. In January a
                        detachment of Honduranean troops seized Gape Gracias á Dios, in Nicaragua,
                        about 60 miles above the Mosquito strip. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >Kearsarge</hi> was ordered to Bluefields to protect the interests of
                        American citizens, but was wrecked on the way on Roncador Reef. Early in
                        February the Government of Nicaragua sent a military force to the strip to
                        repel the threatened invasion. On February 11 the Nicaraguans occupied the
                        Bluff, and on the 12th they took possession of Bluefields, and proclaimed
                        martial law in the reservation. Against this action Clarence, the so-called
                        Mosquito chief, protested.</p>
                    <p>War vessels of Great Britain and, later, of the United States were sent to
                        Bluefields to protect the respective foreign interests in that locality. The
                        Nicaraguan commissioner to the reservation attempted, with the concurrence
                        of the British naval and consular representatives, to organize a provisional
                        administration for the strip, in which Nicaraguans and foreigners were to
                        take part, but the endeavor proved abortive. This Government withheld its
                        sanction of the scheme as inimical to the sovereignty of Nicaragua, and
                        American citizens at Bluefields refrained from participating in the proposed
                        administration, British marines were temporarily landed to protect life and
                        property in view of threatened disturbance, but they were withdrawn when the
                        necessity for their presence no longer existed, and thereafter an American
                        vessel sufficed for all needs of foreign protection.</p>
                    <p>In July last a movement against the Nicaraguan authority was temporarily
                        successful, the so-called Indian Government was for a time restored, the
                        Bluff captured with loss of life on the part of Nicaragua, and the
                        Nicaraguan garrison of Bluefields expelled. A few citizens of the United
                        States who are believed to have taken part in this insurrection left the
                        country. Two Americans, Lampton and Wiltbank, accepted municipal office
                        under the short-lived régime, and they and ten or twelve others, mostly
                        English and Jamaicans, were arbitrarily arrested and banished. The urgent
                        remonstrance of this Government and its demand that the two Americans be
                        allowed a hearing, and in any event an opportunity to arrange their affairs
                        before expulsion, resulted in permission being given them to return to
                        Bluefields under pledge of good behavior.</p>
                    <p>With these exceptions, and perhaps that of one Ausburn, whose return was for
                        a short time refused, but afterwards allowed, the undersigned is not advised
                        that American citizens in Bluefields have been arrested. Sundry complaints
                        growing out of interruptions of trade and use of American vessels by the
                        Nicaraguan authorities have had proper attention, and will doubtless yield
                        to the usual methods of treatment.</p>
                    <p>During the period covered by the events in question the Nicaraguan Government
                        withdrew the exequatur of Mr. Braida, the United States consul at San Juan
                        del Norte, on the ground of his alleged unfriendly acts, but it was
                        subsequently restored.</p>
                    <p>An unfortunate incident for a time threatened to strain the good relations
                        between this Government and that of Nicaragua. One Wilson, an American
                        citizen, having been murdered at Rama by Argüello, the temporary governor of
                        the town, a demand for the trial and punishment of the criminal and his
                        accomplice was made. Argüello was arrested at Rama, but escaped, with the
                        evident connivauce of the local authorities, and his rearrest and detention
                        at Bluefields were followed by a second escape, under circumstances
                        indicating gross negligence, to say the least, on the part of those
                        responsible for his safe custody. He is said to have fled the country, thus
                        baffling the efforts of the proper <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0010"
                        />authorities to do justice in the case. The Nicaraguan Government, however,
                        testified its abhorrence of the atrocious crime by dismissing Torres from
                        the office of governor of Rama, and by sending another commissioner to the
                        reservation in place of Lacayo, who was in command at Bluefields at the time
                        of the second escape.</p>
                    <p>The facts above stated and incidental references to the treatment of the
                        question of the interoceanic canal by the Government of Nicaragua appear in
                        the correspondence.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that from the beginning of the conflicts, which at times
                        were serious, this Government has steadily recognized the paramount
                        sovereignty of Nicaragua over the entire reservation, yielding to no
                        pretentions inconsistent with that sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>At no time during the last forty or fifty years has the so-called native
                        Indian government in the strip been real. On the contrary, it has been an
                        alien municipal government administered according to alien methods. Although
                        Americans and American interests have for sometime predominated in the
                        strip, this Government, while intervening in proper cases for their
                        protection, has consistently disavowed any right of its own or of its
                        citizens to govern the reservation or participate in its political affairs.
                        Whatever right of self government the Indians enjoyed under the treaty
                        concluded between Great Britain and Nicaragua was to be exercised by
                        themselves and not by aliens in their name. That treaty contemplated the
                        eventual surrender by the Indians of their right to govern themselves and
                        other inhabitants of the strip, and their “incorporation into the Republic
                        of Nicaragua on the same footing as other citizens of the Republic.”</p>
                    <p>A copy of a convention, concluded on the 20th of November last, is herewith
                        communicated, by which it is declared that the Mosquito Islands, while
                        retaining “special privileges” in accordance with their “customs” and
                        “racial disposition,” have “agreed wholly to submit to the laws and
                        authorities of Nicaragua for the purpose of forming part of the political
                        and administrative organization.”</p>
                    <p>Great Britain, it is proper to say, has given this Government the most
                        positive assurance that she asserts no right of sovereignty or protection
                        over the territory, but on the contrary respects the full and paramount
                        sovereignty of the Government of Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In compliance with your request made some
                            time ago, I transmit herewith a brief report relating to the condition
                            of public affairs in the Mosquito Reservation.</p>
                        <p>We have recently had considerable local excitement, caused by rumors of a
                            threatened invasion of the Mosquito Reservation by bodies of armed men
                            from Honduras.</p>
                        <p>About the 5th of the present month about two hundred Nicaraguan soldiers
                            were landed at Bluefields, and were quartered for several days on the
                            steamboat <hi rend="italic">Mabel Comeaux</hi>, which lies in the harbor
                            in front of the town.</p>
                        <p>They were awaiting transportation to Honduras, and were finally sent
                            forward to their destination on board the schooner <hi rend="italic"
                                >Ensmo White</hi>, which was towed as far as Cape Gracias by the
                            steamer <hi rend="italic">Yeslie</hi>. Their presence at Bluefields did
                            not fail to produce a stir and commotion among the natives and residents
                            of the town.</p>
                        <pb n="11" xml:id="pg_11" facs="0018"/>
                        <p>The chief, or more properly his advisers, construed the mobilization of
                            Nicaraguan troops within the reservation as an infraction of their
                            rights under the treaty of Managua.</p>
                        <p>One of the Mosquito officials, by the name of Usher Hodgoon, called on
                            Commissioner Lacayo, and demanded the withdrawal of the soldiers or the
                            surrender of their arms to the municipal authorities of the town. Of
                            course the commissioner refused to comply with the demand.</p>
                        <p>On the 13th instant a written communication, signed by Robert Henry
                            Clarence, chief, was received by the commissioner, protesting against
                            the presence of armed soldiers of Nicaragua, and serving notice on the
                            commissioner that protest would be made to Her Britannic Majesty’s
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner answered the chiefs communication, notifying him that
                            the Republic of Nicaragua was then at war with Honduras, and that the
                            necessity had arisen for placing the coasts and frontier of the
                            sovereign in a state of defense, and that only the sovereign could
                            determine the measures for such defense; that no treaty obligations
                            could bind the sovereignty to jeopardize its own existence; that he, the
                            chief, had no diplomatic recognition; that he had no foreign relations
                            or representation and no international responsibility, and that,
                            therefore, he did not recognize his right to interpret for himself the
                            treaty obligations of the sovereign, nor did he (Lacayo) admit the right
                            of England to interfere in any way whatever.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th instant the soldiers were sent forward, as above stated, to
                            the Honduras border.</p>
                        <p>Since the departure of the soldiers two meetings have been held in the
                            town for the alleged purpose of devising ways and means for the local
                            protection of life and property, in which some foreign residents as well
                            as natives were participants.</p>
                        <p>A question arose as to the right of the people to organize military
                            forces without the consent and approval of the sovereign power.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner was willing that a local guard should be organized, but
                            to be under the control of the sovereign power and to be replaced by the
                            Nicaraguan troops when they returned.</p>
                        <p>I do not know if any agreement was arrived at, but on yesterday morning a
                            body of twenty-five natives, armed with Remington rifles, commanded by
                            one officer, marched up and down the principal street and afterwards
                            assembled at the old government building, where they seemed to have
                            established temporary quarters.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner is certainly charged with a very delicate mission, and I
                            fear will have an exceedingly difficult task to establish here a due
                            recognition of the sovereign authority without some local trouble.</p>
                        <p>The political authority of the reservation has been in the hands of the
                            same set of men for many years past, each one of whom has not hesitated
                            to assume the functions of one, two, and three offices, and that without
                            accountability to any source but themselves.</p>
                        <p>Two natives of the Island of Jamaica, one J. W. Cuthbert and one John D.
                            Thomas, both of whom claim their British nationality, are the
                            acknowledged leaders of this ring of rulers; and under their control the
                            others have become thoroughly inoculated with the idea of their local
                            independence of the sovereign, and that their political status, as such,
                            is fully recognized, and that they are under the special protection of
                            Great Britain. Hence they are exceedingly tenacious of the power so long
                            wielded by themselves in the reservation, and which they have come to
                            look upon as legitimate and proper.</p>
                        <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0019"/>
                        <p>As a matter of feet the Mosquito Indians proper know but little of the
                            Government as it exists 5 and according to well authenticated reports
                            have become dissatisfied and have recently developed considerable
                            opposition to this local régime.</p>
                        <p>They claim that they are not the beneficiaries of anything that is done;
                            that their country is being alienated and its wealth squandered for the
                            enrichment of their rulers, while they as a people are left destitute
                            and poor.</p>
                        <p>The administration of justice in the reservation has long been a
                            practical failure, to such an extent that scarcely anyone thinks now of
                            appealing to the local courts for the assertion of any legal right.</p>
                        <p>Their courts will render a judgment, but they will not issue an execution
                            upon such judgment, and consequently the debtor class in the reservation
                            has a free bill, while the creditor class is left without a remedy.</p>
                        <p>It seems to be the purpose of the commissioner to remedy existing abuses
                            by the reincorporation of the reservation into the Republic, but I fear
                            this can not be effected without opposition from the people who at
                            present control the reservation.</p>

                            Honduranean troops are at Cape Gracias á Dios, Nicaragua, and as war
                            exists at present between the Governments of Nicaragua and Honduras, we,

                        <p>Honduras is noted for its cruel warfare, and if the Mosquito Reservation
                            should fall into its hands, over a million dollars of property belonging
                            to citizens of the United States would be pillaged and plundered and
                            many lives sacrificed.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to report that Nicaraguan troops
                        occupied Blueflelds during the night of February 10–11, and took possession
                        of all the public buildings.</p>
                    <p>The chief sent a protest to Her British Majesty’s consul, Mr. H. F. Bingham,
                        at this port, who himself showed me the whole correspondence between the
                        chief and Don Carlos Alberto Lacayo, the commissioner of Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the Nicaraguan Government does not intend to incorporate
                        the reservation by force, but that an assembly of all the chiefs of the
                        Indian tribes will be called in, in order to establish a new council and a
                        municipal authority. So far it has not come to any serious conflict, but the
                        excitement is very great.</p>
                    <p>The intimations and protests which the young chief addressed to the
                        commissioner were ill advised, and will render it difficult for the British
                        Government to favor Mosquito.</p>
                    <p>The commissioner very energetically declined to give the chief
                        explanations—even calling some of the latter’s pretensions “idiotic.” I have
                        all this information only from the British consul, to whom the chief sent a
                        special boat asking for protection.</p>
                    <p>Mr. H. F. Bingham was also informed by an Englishman, coming from the Wanks
                        River, that Houduraneans had taken Cabo Gracias á Dios; that they killed the
                        Nicaraguan governor, Franc. Guerrero, and that the soldiers had left for the
                        bush.</p>
                    <p>We are entirely cut off from the interior, and no steamer is expected to come
                        down, on account of the defeat of the Nicaraguan army, the steamship <hi

                            ship of war, must, sooner or later, call for the interference on the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: I seize the opportunity of reporting
                            briefly the latest occurrences in Bluefields.</p>
                        <list>
                            <item>First. On the 3d of March an agreement was arrrived at for the
                                organization of a temporary provisional government for the Mosquito
                                Reservation.</item>
                            <item>Second. This agreement was concluded between “Captain Howe,
                                commander of the British war ship <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>,
                                and Gen. Carlos A. Lacayo, and it provided for the appointment of a
                                municipal council consisting of four persons, two of whom are
                                appointed by General Lacayo and two appointed by myself, and Lacayo
                                to be the presiding officer of such council.</item>
                            <item>Third. The parties appointed by Lacayo are Don Necho Thomas, of
                                Roma, and Dr. N. Barbarina, and the parties appointed by myself are
                                Messrs. Samuel Weil and J. S. Lampton, both American residents of
                                Bluefields.</item>
                            <item>The agreement also provided that the English language should be
                                the business and court language of the country.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. It was also agreed that the Nicaraguan soldiers should be
                                retired, leaving only a police guard of some twenty men until the
                                provisional government could be established.</item>
                            <item>Fifth. The order to retire the Nicaraguan soldiers was executed on
                                the 5th, and they went on “board the war ship <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Cleopatra</hi> and sailed the same evening for San Juan del
                                Norte.</item>
                            <item>Sixth. After the soldiers were withdrawn (martial law having been
                                declared off), there was an interregnum, during which time there was
                                really no established authority in the reserve.</item>
                            <item>Seventh. About 3 o’clock p.m., after the retirement of the
                                soldiers, a Jamaica negro, said to be the servant of Commissioner
                                Lacayo, walked down the main street, revolver in hand, firing right
                                and left among the crowds of people standing and passing to and
                                fro.</item>
                            <item>Eigth. After firing some five shots, which almost miraculously did
                                no injury, he was assaulted by a number of persons with clubs,
                                rocks, etc., and beaten almost to insensibility.</item>
                            <item>Ninth. All the negro population seemed to be intensely excited
                                over this occurrence, and were collected in groups on the main
                                street, all talking and gesticulating excitedly.</item>
                            <item>Tenth. At night, however, everything seemed quiet as usual, and
                                people went to their homes and all was still, and the streets
                                presenting their accustomed lonely, desolate look.</item>
                            <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0024"/>
                            <item>Eleventh. About 9 o’clock p.m. a shot was fired in the upper end
                                of the town, then another, then another, until some twenty shots or
                                more were fired; and this startled the whole population, so that
                                suddenly the streets were crowded with excited crowds of men and
                                frightened women and children, and it was then ascertained that two
                                of the policemen on King or Main street had been killed near a
                                drinking shop belonging to a native by the name of Martin
                                Ellis.</item>
                            <item>Twelfth. The vice consul, E. D. Hatch, and Commissioner Lacayo
                                joined in a request of the officer commanding the British marines to
                                bring his marines on shore as quick as possible to protect life and
                                property and to prevent riot and bloodshed.</item>
                            <item>Thirteenth. The request was promply responded to, and this morning
                                we are feeling secure in the presence of Her Britannic Majesty’s
                                hardy, brave-looking marines.</item>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my cablegram of this date in
                        connection with the condition of affairs in that section of Nicaragua known
                        as the Mosquito Reservation, I have the honor of submitting to you
                        inclosures numbered from 1 to 9, inclusive, which contain all of the
                        information within my possession,</p>
                    <p>I have had full conferences with President Zelaya upon the general subject,
                        and he has shown me all of the correspondence which is in his possession
                        upon the question. This correspondence, however, is quite limited.</p>
                    <p>The President informs me that the legal citizens—the native Indians—of the
                        Mosquito Reservation have been crowded out of all participation in the
                        affairs of the Government, and that Jamaica negroes, who are British
                        subjects, have usurped the rule of the territory, to the detriment of the
                        interests of both the native citizens and the white Americans who are doing
                        business there. The President seems impressed with the duty of extending the
                        power and jurisdiction of the Nicaraguan Government over the disputed
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>By reference to inclosure No. 9 you will observe the commissioner of the
                        Nicaraguan Government, Mr. Carlos A. Lacayo, and the British consul, H. F.
                        Bingham, of Greytown, have entered into an agreement by which the military
                        of both Governments were withdrawn and the administration of the Government
                        temporarily placed in the hands of a commission, which body is to be
                        selected by Mr. Lacayo’s naming three members and Mr. Bingham two.<note
                            n="1" xml:id="d12fn1">But see inclosure 1 in <ref target="#d10">No.
                                10</ref>.</note> In the meantime, the future of the territory will
                        be discussed between the British-minister at Guatemala and the Government in
                        this city.</p>
                    <p>The President expresses satisfaction at the courteous manner in which the
                        commander of the British man-of-war acted and with the present situation of
                        affairs.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit you herewith
                            the copies of Mr. Seat’s—the United States consular agent at
                            Bluefields—report and inclosures of importance. The merchants in the
                            reservation had been the beneficiaries of special privileges under the
                            former administration, which they wished to be perpetuated by the new
                            régime. For example, they had not been required to present certified
                            invoices upon their importations; and consequently, the values of such
                            importations were accepted upon the mere statements made by themselves
                            or their agents, and these practices or privileges must have been
                            allowed, either by agreement or through the ignorance of the former
                            authorities.</p>
                        <p>Of course, honestly acquired vested interests should be recognized under
                            any circumstances and protected, no matter what change of commission
                            takes place; however, Mr. Seat did not ask the commissioner in his
                            communication to protect any such special privilege acquired from the
                            former Government through the ignorance of those who had control of
                            affairs at that time, but all vested interests of Americans in the
                            reservation should have full recognition and protection-by the sovereign
                            power.</p>
                        <p>The institution of martial law at once supersedes all other authority in
                            the district in which it exists, and while it does exist all rights of
                            every description might be swept away, as no means of relief are left to
                            those upon whom it operates.</p>
                        <p>In his answer the commissioner did not give any assurance that any
                            interests., would be recognized, but expressed the opinion that the
                            supreme Government would do so.</p>
                        <p>A large majority of Americans and others were ripe for some conservative
                            reform of existing abuses, regarding as they did the controlling faction
                            as corrupt and incompetent to govern, where the conditions required a
                            higher order of intelligence and character than those then in authority,
                            under the Mosquito chief. But the necessity of instituting martial law
                            and declaring the whole reservation in a state of siege had not occurred
                            to anyone, either native born or foreigner.</p>
                        <p>This sudden change from a comparative state of independence to one of
                            purely bayonet rule has had a paralyzing effect upon every line of
                            industry, and if it continues will certainly lead to a disastrous
                            shrinkage in values of every description.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just received this morning a
                            communication signed by a number of the residents of the reservation
                            setting forth the fact that they represent property interests in the
                            reservation amounting to one and a half million dollars or more; that
                            they have inaugurated industrial enterprises, invested large sums of
                            money, built up extensive business connections, established important
                            trade relations with every <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0027"
                            />portion of the said reservation, and that they hold leases, contracts,
                            concessions, grants, etc., from the deposed Mosquito Government, which
                            they fairly and honestly acquired from the said Government in good faith
                            and at full, fair, and valuable considerations.</p>
                        <p>They further state that they have acquired the aforesaid interests,
                            invested their aforesaid capital, and have projected and conducted their
                            aforesaid various enterprises for years past under the guaranties
                            afforded by the constitutional provisions of the Mosquito code and by
                            the terms and stipulations of the treaty of Managua, and that the rights
                            and interests so acquired have become vested rights and interests, of
                            which they can not be justly deprived by any change of the local
                            dominion; and that the said vested rights and interests, if not fully
                            recognized and protected by the new regime, will signify the destruction
                            of the local trade, the ruin of the commerce of the reservation, and the
                            impoverishment of those who had endeavored to develop and advance the
                            country. They further declare that they do not call into question the
                            sovereign authority of Nicaragua to occupy the territory of the Mosquito
                            or its right to change the local administration of the reserve, but they
                            aver that in whatever changes are made they are entitled to be duly
                            considered as an element whose interests must be affected by any and all
                            changes that may be made which would ignore or deprive them of the
                            rights and interests heretofore acquired in good faith under the former
                            administration of affairs in the Mosquito Reservation.</p>
                        <p>They further state that they are fully aware of the cordial relations
                            existing between their home Government and the Government of Nicaragua,
                            and that they would wish to see such cordial relations perpetuated and
                            strengthened, and that they believe that they will be, by a due
                            observance of the rights and duties of each toward the other, and a due
                            respect for their mutual interests; and they have full confidence that
                            all their rights will be recognized and eventually adjusted according to
                            equity and good conscience. But since the promulgation of martial law
                            within the district of Mosquito, they are impressed with the necessity
                            of an immediate recognition of their said rights in the reserve as
                            American residents, and of assurauces from the proper source that their
                            interests will be protected and held to be inviolable by the sovereign
                            power of the Republic.</p>
                        <p>They have therefore appealed to me as the American representative at this
                            port to solicit from you some definite assurances that all vested rights
                            and interests of Americans in the reserve will be respected and be given
                            recognition and adequate protection by the sovereign authority.</p>
                        <p>During the existence of martial law in this district the liability of
                            insurance companies is suspended; they therefore ask to be informed, in
                            cases of loss by fire, how are the sufferers to be reimbursed and by
                            whom?</p>
                        <p>They also respectively inquire if the Spanish language is to be
                            substituted for the English in the business forms and transactions of
                            the country, and in the local courts; and if so, will it not operate a
                            hardship on the people of the reserve, this being almost purely an
                            English-speaking community.</p>
                        <p>With great respect, I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my last letter, written on the 15th
                            instant, I have to report that there has been but little change in the
                            situation.</p>
                        <p>The town continues under martial law, and some sort of military edict
                            [is] issued almost daily from the headquarters of Commissioner
                            Lacayo.</p>
                        <p>Early on the 10th instant a bulletin appeared and was distributed in the
                            streets giving an account of the landing of the troops, and assuring the
                            inhabitants of the town that they need not fear a few Nicaraguan
                            soldiers, as Her Majesty the Queen of England would certainly carry out
                            her treaty obligations to the chief of Mosquito. * * *</p>
                        <p>On the same day, the 10th, a proclamation from Commissioner Lacayo
                            appeared, notifying the citizens of Bluefields of the existence of war
                            between Honduras and Nicaragua, and assuring them that the Nicaraguan
                            soldiers were here to defend the homes and interests of natives and
                            foreigners, and that they had nothing to fear.</p>
                        <p>Between the 10th and 12th some communications were passed between
                            Commissioner Lacayo and the Mosquito chief, the exact nature of which I
                            could not ascertain, but was informed that the chief had notified the
                            commissioner that he was violating the treaty of Managua by bringing
                            armed soldiers into Bluefields, and that he (the commissioner), his
                            officers and soldiers, were subject to arrest tor such violation of the
                            law.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 12th instant a proclamation was issued by Rigoberto
                            Cabezas, declaring martial law and the town in a state of siege; a copy
                            of which proclamation is herewith attached.</p>
                        <p>The promulgation of martial law naturally produced intense excitement, as
                            it had not been anticipated. The chief and others of his Government
                            officials left the town and a large body of the native negroes of
                            Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>On the 15th instant the merchants and other American residents addressed
                            an official letter to myself as the representative of America, asking me
                            to communicate with the commissioner and solicit from him some special
                            assurances that the vested rights and interests of Americans in the
                            reserve would be recognized and protected.</p>
                        <p>The same day I prepared a letter, setting forth the requests made by the
                            American residents, and asking the commissioner for assurances in behalf
                            of my countrymen that their vested interests and rights would be
                            recognized and protected by the sovereign authority.</p>
                        <p>On the 17th instant I received from the commissioner a reply to the
                            above, acknowledging the receipt of the letter and stating that it would
                            be forwarded to his Government for consideration, and that he
                            entertained no doubt that the rights not only of Americans, but of all
                            other persons would be recognized and protected.</p>
                        <p>On the 19th instant an order was issued directed to the merchants
                            requiring all vessels bringing goods from abroad to discharge them at
                            the Government’s wharf at the Bluff; second, prohibiting them from
                            making fast to private wharves; third, requiring them to present their
                            invoices in Spanish, and authenticated by a Nicaraguan consul at the
                            port of departure, or by a notary public; and iu case of noncompliance
                            to be subjected to fine.</p>
                        <pb n="22" xml:id="pg_22" facs="0029"/>
                        <p>The same day a notice was served on the merchants requiring them to
                            present themselves at the office of the collector at 3 p.m. on the 20th,
                            for the purpose of liquidating their duties, and imposing a fine of $25
                            a day for every day’s delay in presenting their paid invoices.</p>
                        <p>This embraces the most important orders issued since the occupation of
                            the town and since the promulgation of martial law.</p>
                        <p>I believe the orders have been complied with generally up to the present
                            time.</p>
                        <p>This morning there are reports on the streets of a housebreaking and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: Inasmuch as the commissioner of the
                            Republic of Nicaragua to the Mosquito Reservation has deposed the local
                            government and declared martial law, we, the citizens of the United
                            States of America, merchants of Bluefields and vicinity, feel that our
                            interests, which amount to at least one and one-half million dollars,
                            are not protected, and rights, privileges, and vested rights obtained
                            and enjoyed are in danger of being taken away from us.</p>
                        <p>By the action of declaring martial law a serious fault is committed
                            against our interests, for it makes all insurance policies null and void
                            and places all our properties in jeopardy, and in case of fire our
                            losses-and hardships would be severe, and in many instances the
                            possessions of citizens of the United States would thus be swept away
                            and leave them in poverty.</p>
                        <p>Many of us have leases, contracts, grants, and concessions obtained
                            honorably from the deposed Mosquito Government, and for valuable
                            considerations; and from expressions uttered by Sr. Carlos A. Lacayo,
                            commissioner, these are in danger of not being recognized by the
                            Nicaraguan Government, to our injury.</p>
                        <p>We have made our investments in this reservation, knowing there existed a
                            guaranty in the shape of treaty, which treaty has been observed and been
                            in effect for over thirty years, and our capital, labor, and fortunes
                            within this reservation have been placed here by us with the feeling
                            that we were living in a free zone, with perfect security, and not to be
                            affected by the well-known caprices of a Latin-American government.</p>
                        <p>Now, by the action of the said commissioner, the fruits of our labor, the
                            commerce of the reservation, which has been developed and is upheld
                            almost solely by the citizens of the United States, will be hampered and
                            eventually ruined; for the duties existing here prior to the deposing of
                            the local authorities were lenient and moderate, and it is now proposed
                            by the Nicaraguan authorities now in charge of the Mosquito Reservation
                            to increase said duties and collect them, and there is no telling where
                            or when the further increase of duties will end.</p>
                        <p>The Spanish language to be introduced here, within a territory that has
                            been an English speaking one for years, and all records kept in <pb
                                n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0030"/>that language, will work
                            hardships upon us, and can be used to entrap us to commit ourselves.</p>
                        <p>The new authorities will require consular invoices from the United
                            States, entailing extra expense upon the merchants and more labor. This
                            was not required by the previous Government; and as our importations
                            come mainly from New Orleans, La., U. S. A., and steamers remain in that
                            port frequently only long enough to discharge and load, the time
                            entailed to make these invoices in Spanish will work to our injury.</p>
                        <p>The officers appointed thus far by the said commissioner are collector of
                            customs, treasurer, port surgeons, and some minor officers. The
                            collector of customs has issued the inclosed circular requesting them to
                            pay duties to him.</p>
                        <p>We recognize the supreme authorities of Nicaragua, and are not protesting
                            against their placing troops here; for we acknowledge same to be their
                            rights, simply protesting against Nicaragua interfering with any of the
                            local laws of the reservation affecting our previous rights and
                            privileges.</p>
                        <p>American shipping has been hampered by being required to obtain certain
                            manifests, permits, and same serve to detain said vessels unnecessarily,
                            and were not required heretofore by the local authorities.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as our representative, we respectfully ask that you address a
                            note to the acting authorities requesting that they give pledges and
                            guaranties that the interests, vested rights, rights and privileges
                            enjoyed by citizens of the United States shall remain intact and shall
                            not be interfered with, and would also respectfully ask that you will
                            inform our Government of the situation, the jeopardy our properties are
                            placed in, and that we ask the good offices of the United States to
                            secure for us the protection of our rights that we are entitled to.</p>

                        <p rend="flushleft">To the Citizens of Bluefields, greeting:</p>
                        <p>You know that, challenged by the tyrant who reigns in Honduras, we
                            accepted as a duty to our national honor the glove that was thrown
                            down.</p>
                        <p>The war has been occasioned by an ambitious and criminal man whose
                            barbarous actions are known to you.</p>
                        <p>It was he who bombarded an American vessel which had on board the
                            minister of the United States.</p>
                        <p>He is the same cruel tyrant who failed to respect anything in his own
                            country, even to women and children, and the same who, naming himself
                            chief of the Mosquito Reservation, proceeded to throw his wild hordes on
                            these unprotected, cities which would have happened, if in the battle of
                            Ilaya our soldiers had not routed them.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding that we have fortified Cape Gracias a Dios, the marauders
                            from Vasquez could invade this port, if Nicaragua were to leave it
                            without defense.</p>
                        <p>Our forces have arrived and you have with yon the vanguard of the
                            soldiers of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>They come to defend your homes and your interests, and they come also to
                            save the lives and interests of the strangers, for which Nicaragua is
                            responsible by international law, and would be criminally negligent if
                            she did not do all that is in her power to give them the protection of
                            her flag and soldiers.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas is the honorable chief of our military forces, who
                            promises to have the laws of the Republic respected, which are the
                            rights and guarantees of each person.</p>
                        <p>Have faith in our army, whose heroism and bravery have planted our
                            glorious and victorious banner in the last bulwark of Vasquez.</p>
                        <p>The people of Bluefields have nothing to fear.</p>
                        <p>Our sovereignty is their safeguard.</p>

                    <p>Just had an audience with Lord Kimberly, who is without precise knowledge or
                        reliable information of occurrences at Bluefields. British Government have
                        given no instructions and are awaiting information which, when received,
                        will be promptly and fully communicated to the United States. British consul
                        at Grey town telegraphed, 4th of March, British minister at Guatemala, that
                        Nicaraguans suddenly seized Blue-fields and displaced Mosquito flag,
                        behaving violently and cruelly. Because of disorders and dangers to
                        residents, British war vessels visited Bluefields. Mosquito flag rehoisted,
                        quiet restored, pending settlement. Extract from Lord Salisbury note of
                        March, 1889, in <ref target="frus1889#pg_469">Foreign Relations for that
                            year, page 469</ref>, has full concurrence of Lord Kimberly, “No
                        protectorate in substance or form, nor anything in <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27"
                            facs="0034"/>nature of protectorate, desired or intended by British
                        Government.” Read in this connection instructions, Bayard to Phelps, No.
                        530, November, 1888. I believe landing of forces was to extend safety to
                        residents and check violence.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: * * * On the 15th, when I went to the foreign
                        office, I stated the solicitude of my Government to be fully informed of the
                        particulars of the incident of landing an armed force from a British
                        man-of-war at Bluefields. I found Lord Kimberley (just in office) very
                        willing to tell me all he knew, but in fact with but little to communicate
                        that, to use his own words, “had either precision or reliability.</p>
                    <p>My telegram<note n="1" xml:id="d16fn1">See <ref target="#d15">No.
                            15</ref>.</note> is as near the intelligible substance of his statements
                        as possible.</p>
                    <p>There were no orders given by this Government, and no instructions applied
                        for, prior to the landing, nor could his lordship inform me from whom the
                        application came nor to whom it was made, and they have since endeavored to
                        obtain knowledge of all the facts, and appear to be very disinclined to
                        interference.</p>
                    <p>The collision (whatever it was) between the Nicaraguans and the Indian
                        residents of the reservation occurred suddenly, and I have a strong
                        impression that had the <hi rend="italic">Kearsarge</hi> arrived before the
                        British vessel, au endeavor would have been made by her commander to avert
                        danger and protect the lives and property of American citizens in that
                        remote and unregulated locality.</p>
                    <p>Lord Kimberly read to me from a telegram—a somewhat obscure report from the
                        British consul at Grey town—that there was a claim asserted by the
                        Nicaraguans that at some time prior (date not given) an agreement by the
                        Indian council of the reservation had been made, while two British vessels
                        were in port, for the incorporation of the reservation into the Nicaraguan
                        territory, and that their action of hauling down the Mosquito flag at
                        Bluefields was in consequence of such an agreement.</p>
                    <p>All this telegraphic communication is necessarily imperfect and but slightly
                        reliable, and I am promised by Lord Kimberley instant information, as it
                        shall be received hereafter at the foreign office.</p>
                    <p>In my last telegram I made reference to certain correspondence which is
                        contained in the volumes of our Foreign Relations, as giving the most
                        reliable basis of dealing with events as they are now being disclosed.</p>
                    <p>The status of the “reservation” of the Mosquito Indians in relation to
                        Nicaragua is anomalous, and is today embarrassed by the very regretable
                        action of Nicaragua in consenting without notice or consultation with the
                        United States, to submit in 1879 the question of the degree of her
                        sovereignty over the Indian territory of Mosquito to the umpirage and sole
                        arbitration of the Emperor of Austria Hungary. Nor do I understand the
                        action of Great Britain, who by her convention of 1850 (the Olayton-Bulwer
                        treaty) with the United States, by <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0035"
                        />which the attitude and relations of both of those high contracting parties
                        in relation to the Central American States and their territories were so
                        carefully considered, so that the two Governments had pledged themselves to
                        a mutual and several abstention from political interference or control in
                        that geographical region; and yet, without consultation or notice to the
                        United States, the award of a foreign government of Europe is sought and
                        accepted, which, as it has been proved more than once, contains results of a
                        most important and influential character upon the very questions which the
                        treaty of 1850 was intended to control.</p>
                    <p>For this reason I respectfully referred you to an instruction dated November
                        23, 1888, by the then Secretary of State to Mr. Phelps, then minister at the
                        Court of St. James, which is to be found at <ref target="frus1888p1#pg_759"
                            >page 759 of the Foreign Relations volume for 1888</ref>.</p>
                    <p>By that instruction it will appear that Nicaragua had at once called upon the
                        United States, when the British representative at Nicaragua proposed
                        intervention by his Government in relation to the exercise of certain acts
                        of sovereignty—according to the usual and accepted meaning of that word—by
                        Nicaragua over the territory occupied by the Mosquito Indians, and included
                        in the “reservation” which they were to occupy under and subject to that
                        sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>The views of the United States Government, as set forth in the instruction
                        referred to, were communicated to the British Government on December 4,
                        1888, but no reply was made until the month of March following, and when a
                        change of Administration in the United States had just taken place.</p>
                    <p>The reply of the Marquis of Salisbury was delivered by the British chargé
                        d’affaires in Washington on the 28th of March, 1889, and there the question
                        was allowed to rest for four years, and not until February, 893, was the
                        correspondence renewed, as I find by the files of this office.</p>
                    <p>At the date last mentioned, Mr. Foster, then Secretary of State, instructed
                        Mr. Lincoln (my immediate predecessor here), who communicated a copy thereof
                        to Lord Rosebery, then Her Majesty’s secretary of state for foreign affairs,
                        and no reply has yet been made thereto.</p>
                    <p>May I respectfully suggest that all the correspondence above referred to—the
                        documents containing the treaty of Managua, between Great Britain and
                        Nicaragua, the terms of the reference to and the award of the Emperor of
                        Austrian-be printed by the United States, so as to present compendiously the
                        questions involved, in order that they may receive a just, intelligent,
                        amicable, and satisfactory solution.</p>
                    <p>An interesting and important part of the history of this question is
                        contained in the instruction, dated April 26, 1873, by Mr. Fish, then
                        Secretary of State, to General Schenck, United States minister to Great
                        Britain. That document is on file in this embassy.</p>

                        United States consular agent at that place and <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29"
                            facs="0036"/>also in compliance with the urgent appeals made to me by
                        American citizens, several of whom had gone to Greytown as a delegation to
                        bring me back with them to this place.</p>
                    <p>Mr. F. H. Bingham, the British consul at Greytown, returned with me. On
                        arrival in Bluefields we found the place occupied by the British marines and
                        soldiers as had been previously represented, and good order maintained by
                        them as a police authority. Every day since my arrival I have met Mr.
                        Bingham and General Lacayo, or his representative, in conference concerning
                        the creation of a provisional government for the Mosquito Reservation, and
                        propositions and counter propositions have been made, but none could be
                        agreed on by all the parties up to the present date on account of the wide
                        range of power sought to be obtained by the Nicaraguan representatives. They
                        ask to make Lacayo virtually the governor of the reservation, with very
                        large discretionary powers, while the American elements insist that there
                        should be no interference by any other than the people, who should be left
                        free to create their own local regime. The matter of Corn Island was also
                        taken up and a petition of the citizens of that island considered. It asked
                        protection from the British, A British man-of-war was at Corn Island
                        recently.</p>
                    <p>I had anticipated this in a telegram to Minister Baker at Managua some ten
                        days ago.</p>
                    <p>The American element do not consider themselves as being the parties to
                        settle the questions now in issue here, but both the Nicaraguans and the
                        British seem especially anxious that the Americans shall take a prominent
                        part in the arrangements made, and do not seem inclined to agree upon
                        measures and settle matters themselves, but to be determined to shoulder a
                        great part of the responsibility upon the Americans.</p>
                    <p>The Americans residing here realize the necessity of getting clear of the
                        incompetent negro domination, but they are afraid of Nicaraguan cupidity and
                        tyranny.</p>
                    <p>Something may be effected within the next few days, as all parties are
                        growing anxious under the present situation. I beg to include Mr. Seat’s
                        last dispatches explaining the situation, which is still unchanged.</p>
                    <p>I beg to say further that the Americans in a meeting held at the clubroom on

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: Since my last to you on the 6th
                            instant the situation has remained in statu quo.</p>
                        <p>The protocol for a provisional council, mentioned in my last report,
                            which had been adopted by Consul Bingham, the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>, and Lacayo, did not receive full
                            favor, and I suggested that the number of delegates to the proposed
                            council should be eight instead of <pb n="30" xml:id="pg_30" facs="0037"
                            />four, so as to represent in the council not only the Nicaraguan and
                            American elements, but also the British subjects, the Indian and native
                            Creoles.</p>
                        <p>This amendment was accepted and agreed on between Captain Howe and Lacayo
                            in this office in my presence on the evening of the 7th instant.</p>
                        <p>It was to be presented to the council at its first meeting by Mr. Lacayo,
                            the chairman, and adopted as an amendment to the original protocol.</p>
                        <p>The first meeting of the council was called by Lacayo on the evening of
                            the 8th instant, and the amendment was opposed by the Nicaraguan
                            delegates, and finally the meeting adjourned without having accomplished
                            anything toward the creation of a provisional government. Another
                            meeting was held yesterday, but resulted very much as the first one
                            had.</p>
                        <p>The American delegates will not attempt the formation of a provisional
                            government unless every element of the population has a fair
                            representation.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, I think it is the policy of the Nicaraguan delegates
                            not to recognize any representation except the Nicaraguaus and
                            Americans. In that way they expect to control, inasmuch as three
                            Nicaraguans can always outcount and outvote two Americans.</p>
                        <p>The attempt to establish a provisional government by agreement I believe
                            will prove a failure, as the Nicaraguans do not seem to regard equal
                            representation as being important or essential; whereas the American
                            delegates will not recognize any other principle in the adjustment of
                            the present affairs of Mosquito. The marines of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cleopatra</hi> continue their occupation for the protection and
                            preservation of life and property by request of the inhabitants. Almost
                            the entire population, native and foreign, is now in active sympathy
                            with British marines; because they fear that if Nicaragua should have
                            exclusive dominion here it would subject them to the vengeance and spite
                            of those holding official power. Captain Howe says he hopes to see an
                            American man-of-war here soon to relieve him.</p>
                        <p>Hoping you are well,</p>

                        Government of Nicaragua that Consul Braida has been actively in sympathy

                        demands of him, notwithstanding the provocation to retaliate for the insults

                            outgoing mails your recent telegrams. They were delayed in their
                            transmission four days, and when received were so mutilated as to be
                            unintelligible. I undertook to send several telegraph messages to you,
                            all of which required answers. <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0039"/>I
                            received no answers, and conclude that either the messages were not
                            delivered, or if delivered were so mutilated as to be beyond
                            recognition.</p>
                        <p>Complaint has been made to the President of this Republic, by Governor
                            Rivas I presume, that the American consul is throwing his personal and
                            official influence against Nicaragua in the Mosquito affair. I feel sure
                            that you have a just appreciation of the dignity of your official
                            position and of your duty as a representative of the United States,
                            which require you to occupy a friendly position toward this Government,
                            and that you have not departed from this path of duty. But since the
                            statement has been made to me, in a second-hand way, from the public
                            officials here, that you have allowed the insults offered you by the
                            Nicaraguan official at Grey Town, Rivas, to influence you in your action
                            in the Mosquito affairs, I deem many duty to caution you against doing
                            anything by word or deed which could properly be construed into
                            unfriendliness to the Government of Nicaragua or to its claim of
                            sovereign rights over that territory.</p>
                        <p>I will ask you to repeat to me by telegraph, on receipt of this, an
                            unvarnished statement of the facts in the case.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the afternoon of March 14 a meeting was
                            held in the clubhouse by the Americans to tender to the captain
                            commander of Her British Majesty’s ship <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>
                            and to his officers and men their most sincere thanks for the
                            maintenance of order and security.</p>
                        <p>The American residents then discussed and adopted a resolution to send a
                            delegation to Washington, D. C., to state to the home Government the
                            great importance of the political changes in the Mosquito Reservation,
                            concerning their enterprises, commerce and traffic in general, as they
                            considered their welfare endangered.</p>
                        <p>Consular Agent Mr. B. B. Seat and Mr. Sam. Weil, merchant, were
                            unanimously elected, and Mr. George D. Emery, of Boston, Mass. (mahogany
                            firm), will join the delegation at Washington.</p>
                        <p>Since that time all sorts of attempts have been made to induce us
                            Americans to compromise ourselves to become a party in the suspicious
                                <pb n="33" xml:id="pg_33" facs="0040"/>arrangements entered into
                            between the British officials, Captain Commander Howe and Her British
                            Majesty’s Consul Bingham, with Com-missioner Lacayo and General Cabezas
                            to form a provisional government upon a basis which we considered
                            un-American, unfair to the best interests of the inhabitants of the
                            reservation at large, and expressly contrary to the Managua treaty of
                            1860, therefore relieving the English and Nicaraguan officials of all
                            responsibility of the infraction of the treaty of Managua and the
                            Clayton-Bulwer treaty (if there be an infraction) and throwing the
                            responsibility upon our shoulders. We unanimously decided to decline all
                            offers to participate in a provisional government under the condition
                            offered us by the above-named agents of the two high contracting powers
                            to the treaty of Managua.</p>
                        <p>Believing that Mosquito under Spanish rule means the utter ruin of all
                            that American capital and energy has accomplished and built up here in
                            such a wonderfully successful manner in the past few” years. The
                            experience we have had during the past year was tyranny, injustice, and
                            oppression in the most outrageous forms. We suffered without being able
                            to get the least satisfaction or redress.</p>
                        <p>The facts have decided our people here to make a last effort, in sending
                            a delegation to Washington to explain the situation and to prove to the
                            United States Government the need of immediate action. * * *</p>
                        <p>Since Monday morning, March 19, another attempt has been made to form a
                            provisional government, and notwithstanding the reiterated refusals of
                            the Americans to take part in the proposed government, General Lacayo
                            has taken it upon himself to make personal appointments to proposed
                            provisional council, which appointments have in every instance been
                            declined by both Americans and natives.</p>
                        <p>I beg to state that at this time the natives, Creoles as well as Indians,
                            have completely taken our standpoint and will under all circumstances go
                            with us to maintain autonomy to Mosquito.</p>
                        <p>At 3.40 p.m. today, March 21, the river steamer <hi rend="italic"
                                >Hendy</hi> arrived with 30 soldiers on board with their arms boxed.
                            This was in direct violation to the agreement made in my presence on the
                            19th instant at 2 p.m. that Nicaragua would under no pretext bring
                            soldiers, nor employ Nicaraguans in the police force. This created great
                            excitement among the populace, and when I asked Mr. Bingham at the
                            British consulate if this was not a breach of his agreement with General
                            Lacayo, he intimated that he was powerless to act; after which I left
                            him with the impression that the whole proceeding was but another
                            intrigue, and tried to quiet the general excitement.</p>
                        <p>Later in the evening, at the request of several American citizens, I
                            called on General Lacayo to find out what course he intended to pursue
                            in regard to keeping order in the town.</p>
                        <p>During the course of conversation I suggested that he place the town in
                            the hands of the Americans for the night, guaranteeing to keep peace and
                            order on condition that General Lacayo would promise to keep his
                            soldiers in their quarters. General Lacayo expressed himself very much
                            pleased and entirely satisfied to have us do the police duty for the
                            night. I left him, telling him I would call a meeting of Americans and
                            lay the proposition before them. I called the meeting, in which also the
                            natives, Germans, and others participated, and it was resolved to do the
                            police duty for the night.</p>
                        <p>Myself, accompanied by a committee from the meeting, then called upon
                            General Lacayo to inform him that we would take charge of the town for
                            the night. He thanked us, but said that within the last two <pb n="34"
                                xml:id="pg_34" facs="0041"/>hours circumstances had arisen which

                            soldiers.</p>
                        <p>This a.m., March 22, Her British Majesty’s Consul Bingham left on the
                            British Majesty’s ship <hi rend="italic">Canada</hi> for Grey Town.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I had the honor by my dispatch of the 16th
                        instant, to communicate to you some remarks upon the status of the “Mosquito
                        Reservation,” in the territory of Nicaragua. Since then I have received from
                            <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0042"/>Lord Kimberley, on the 24th
                        instant, a memorandum in relation to the incident of the landing of a
                        British armed force at Bluefields, and inclose herewith a copy.</p>
                    <p>As I have before had the honor to state, the political status of these
                        Mosquito Indians and the extent of their rights of local self-government are
                        illy denned, and it is highly desirable for the interests of all concerned
                        that the lines of lawful authority should be more distinctly established and
                        agreed upon.</p>
                    <p>The theater of the events under consideration is remote, and the region is
                        occupied by a population imperfectly civilized and scattered.</p>
                    <p>The most influential residents of Bluefields are traders, English and
                        American, with some negroes from the Island of Jamaica, and information of a
                        reliable and satisfactory nature is necessarily difficult to obtain. But it
                        does not appear that the alleged intervention by the British armed force was
                        for the maintenance of the rights of the Mosquito Indians against alleged
                        Nicaraguan oppressors—but, rather, to protect other classes of residents,
                        who are not mentioned in the treaty of Managua, of 1860, between Great
                        Britain and Nicaragua, and are not parties to any stipulations, express or
                        implied, by that convention.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the memorandum, now transmitted herewith, it is stated that
                        interviews and arrangements for the purpose of restoring peace and order at
                        Bluefields were between the British consuls and the Nicaraguan general, in
                        which it was by and under Nicaraguan authority alone all the measures to
                        restore and maintain peace were to be executed.</p>
                    <p>This arrangement, so far as it goes, implies a recognition of Nicaraguan
                        sovereignty, and the subordination of Mosquito affairs to the (not
                        unqualified) control of the former. I am informed that Nicaragua has paid in
                        full the annuity of $5,000 stipulated for ten years by the treaty of
                        Managua, and I am disposed to believe that, by the exercise of moderation,
                        discretion, and just humanity, Nicaragua can remove all vestige of pretext
                        or reason for any foreign intervention for the settlement of questions of a
                        social or political nature between herself and the Mosquito Indians, and
                        that race and that class are the only individuals who have any recognition
                        or standing under the terms of the treaty of Managua, which contained
                        restrictions upon the sovereignty thereby ceded to Nicaragua by Great
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>It has been reported that Admiral Benham has been asked to visit Bluefields,
                        and I hope it is true and that a reliable report of the condition of that
                        region may thus be furnished.</p>
                    <p>Sir John Hopkins, the British admiral, is a man of the same stamp, and his
                        account may be looked tor with interest and respect by all parties.</p>
                    <p>As a possible contribution to knowledge of the locality and events in
                        question, I inclose copies of a communication by a correspondent of the
                        Times, of the 27th instant, which is, however, evidently colored by the
                        views and prejudices of the writer in the interests of a Moravian
                        mission.</p>
                    <p>The treaty rights of Nicaragua, under the convention of 1860, at Managua,
                        must be interpreted by the then existing state of facts, and it will not be
                        safe to interpolate additional restrictions upon the sovereignty of
                        Nicaragua, as to subjects and interests not then existent and not even
                        contemplated at that time.</p>
                    <p>The spiritual welfare of the Mosquito population was not, and is not, among
                        the responsibilities with which Great Britain was charged or is
                        chargeable.</p>
                    <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0043"/>
                    <p>Upon obtaining further information on the subject I will communicate it to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>I have, etc.</p>

                                personally, at the foreign office.</hi></head>
                        <p>The latest information respecting the state of affairs at Blueflelds is
                            contained in two telegrams from the admiral commanding the West Indies
                            Station and the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Canada</hi>, from
                            Colon.</p>
                        <p>From these telegrams it appears that the captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cleopatra</hi>, Captain Curzon-Howe, had, on the 5th of March, at
                            the request of the consuls and the Nicaraguan commissioner, landed 100
                            men at Bluefields for the protection of life and property; that this
                            detachment had, on the l6’th of March, been replaced by a detachment
                            from the <hi rend="italic">Canada</hi> (Captain Wilson), the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> being under orders to proceed to
                            Newfoundland. The men were reembarked on the 20th, the Nicaraguan
                            commissioner at Bluefields having undertaken to form a provisional
                            government.</p>
                        <p>It is not known what was the exact nature of the disturbances which led
                            to the landing of the men from the British ships, but on the 17th of
                            March Her Majesty’s minister at Guatemala had telegraphed that
                            disturbances had occurred at Bluefields, and that there had been
                            serious’ loss of life and property.</p>
                        <p>The information which had been previously sent by Mr. Gosling, and which
                            was received on the 4th of March, was that the Nicaraguan authorities
                            had, on the 12th of February, overthrown the Government of the Mosquito
                            Reserve, and had proclaimed Nicaraguan authority; that Her Majesty’s
                            consul had telegraphed to Jamaica for a ship of war.</p>
                        <p>On dispatching H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> to Grey Town and
                            the coast of the Mosquito Reserve, Admiral Hopkins gave orders to the
                            captain that his stay in those waters should not be longer than he might
                            consider necessary (after consultation with the local representatives of
                            the British Government) for the protection of British interests and
                            subjects. The same orders were given to the captain of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Canada</hi>, which relieved the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cleopatra.</hi></p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> arrived at Grey Town on the 22d of
                            February, and there her captain learned that early in the month 120
                            Nicaraguan soldiers had arrived and had proceeded to Bluefields, of
                            which they took possession during the night of the 12th, martial law and
                            a state of siege being declared, and all the Mosquitian officials being
                            deposed and the Nicaraguan flag being hoisted.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> took on board Iler Majesty’s consul,
                            and arrived at Bluefields on the 25th of February. The captain and the
                            consul had interviews with the Nicaraguan commissioner and the general
                            in command of the Nicaraguan troops. The result of these interviews was
                            that the general undertook (1) to raise the state of martial law, (2) to
                            hoist the Mosquito flag alongside the flag of Nicaragua, (3) to form a
                            council, (4) to organize a civil police, (5) to send away a portion of
                            his troops.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> left on the 27th of February for
                            Colon, to coal, leaving some armed boats in sight of Bluefields, to
                            which place she subsequently returned to await the arrival of the <hi

                        <p>Allow me to draw the attention of your readers to an act of aggression on
                            the part of Nicaragua. She violently took possession of the Mosquito
                            Reservation on the morning of the 12th instant, invading its capital,
                            the town of Bluefields, with an armed force of soldiers when air its
                            inhabitants were fast asleep, breaking open the Government buildings,
                            and placing them under a strong guard, temporarily arresting those who
                            might have escaped to raise an alarm, forcing open the gaols and letting
                            loose all the prisoners, hoisting her flag on the Mosquito flagstaff,
                            and declaring the natives Nicaraguan citizens. By these measures the
                            Nicaraguans have deprived the chief, Robert Henry Clarence, of his
                            authority as president of the council, dismissed the members of that
                            body, removed the judges of the supreme court, the magistrates, and
                            every government official in the service of his excellency the chief.
                            They have also appropriated moneys, and roughly handled a British
                            subject, the customhouse collector, to obtain the keys of the safe. Up
                            to the present date we have been tinder martial law, which was
                            proclaimed on the 12th instant.</p>
                        <p>In this way Nicaragua has used force and intimidation to deprive the
                            Mosquitos of their rights. She has also offered bribes to many
                            influential persons to agree and consent to this when the final
                            settlement comes. The natives are opposed to any closer relation with
                            Nicaragua, with whom they have no sympathy, their customs, manners, and
                            character being so much at variance. The Mosquitos have a great liking
                            for England; they were happy and contented while under her protectorate
                            from the latter part of the seventeenth century to 1800, and a pang went
                            through the whole of the tribes when the best part of their territory
                            was handed over to Honduras and Nicaragua. However, they were pacified
                            by having a portion set apart for their use and at being free to govern
                            themselves without any interference from the supreme Government; and
                            they implicitly believed that England would see that all the
                            stipulations of the treaty of Managua made between Her Britannic Majesty
                            and the Republic of Nicaragua in 1800 were carried out. So far they have
                            done their best to comply with all the stipulations of this treaty, and
                            have respected the rights of the sovereign power. They have borne
                            patiently the encroachments and oppression of Nicaragua for many years
                            past, protesting and reporting to the foreign office from time to time
                            as they occurred; but, for some reason or other, no satisfaction was
                            ever obtained. For the last ten years the commercial development of this
                            country has made rapid strides. Foreign-capitalists, especially
                            American, have established the banana trade, which is now very
                            extensive; other investments have also been made in connection with the
                            natural products of the country according to the laws of the Mosquito
                            Government, and if this radical and sudden change is to have effect,
                            concessions, grants, leases of lands, and Government obligations will
                            have to be taken into consideration and regulated accordingly, all
                            having been done upon the strength of the treaty.</p>
                        <p>The Nicaraguans have long looked with a jealous eye upon the revenues and
                            harbor advantages of this country, never failing to encroach where they
                            saw a chance, and holding on tenaciously in spite of all remonstrances
                            and opposition. They obtained a footing at Rama City, <pb n="38"
                                xml:id="pg_38" facs="0045"/>situated at the mouth of the Rama and
                            Siquia rivers, tributaries of the Escondido or Bluefields River, a few
                            miles east of the western boundary, and they invited their wealthy men
                            to come there from the interior, granted them lands in the vicinity,
                            irrespective of claims or leases issued by the Mosquito Government,
                            built a quartel for the soldiers, appointed a governor, and extracted
                            dues and revenues from the people. Then they began to watch a large
                            mahogany company who are cutting valuable woods, and wherever a chance
                            could be seen declared the works to be in Nicaragua, thus obtaining the
                            extraction dues. Another instance of encroachment was the establishment
                            of a military station and governor on the Rio Grande or Great River,
                            about lo miles due east of the western boundary. The next step was to
                            strip the reserve of its islands and bays, which the natives possessed
                            for fishing and growing cocoanuts long before the treaty of Managua was
                            ever thought of. Several other encroachments have been reported to the
                            foreign office, the last and most serious being the forcible occupation
                            of Bluefields, the capital of the reservation, and other towns on the
                            coast.</p>
                        <p>The Mosquito constitution and code of laws are well adapted to both
                            natives and foreigners, and the Government is liberal. The
                            Administration had many defects, and must change gradually to suit
                            existing circumstances as commerce and civilization advances; but this
                            does not concern Nicaragua, who has “no control” over the governing
                            powers within the limits of the reserve. Now that these unwarrantable
                            proceedings have taken place, we should like to know definitely how this
                            country stands, and what step England will take. A British man-of-war
                            was sent for by Her Majesty’s consul at Grey Town some time back, but up
                            to date it has not arrived.</p>
                        <p>I may here give an account of the beginning of this serious trouble.
                            General Carlos A. Lacayo, the appointed commissioner to the reserve from
                            Nicaragua, arrived here with a staff of officers on November 2, 1893,
                            seemingly on a secret mission to annex the country. He erected immense
                            buildings to serve as quartel offices and dwelling house. Building a
                            wharf out into the lagoon, lie compelled all ships going up the river to
                            take a pass from him here. He imposed a heavy duty on bananas,
                            principally coming out of the reserve. From the first the natives had
                            their suspicions as to his intentions, and murmurs of disapproval
                            increased day by day. The chief and his council had their attention
                            drawn to the matter, and they also began to look upon it with alarm. To
                            favor the secret scheme there was the war between Honduras and
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>About 200 soldiers came from Grey Town, without any notification to the
                            chief, to be shipped to Truxillo. During their eight days’ sojourn in
                            Bluefields, on board the steamer <hi rend="italic">Mabel Comeaux</hi>,
                            the anxiety of the people was raised to an alarming extent, but upon the
                            advice of the chief and his Government they did not do anything which
                            might have helped to bring about the incorporation which they mortally
                            dread. The soldiers left here for Cape Gracias a. Dios, with an addition
                            of volunteers consisting of Honduras rebels and many others of doubtful
                            character. Other troops, sent for specially by the commissioner, arrived
                            on the steamship <hi rend="italic">Miranda</hi>, and were landed by
                            small boats. When the chief again heard of the arrival of troops lie
                            immediately invited the commissioner to the Government house and put
                            forward several important questions, one of which was whether he still
                            respected the treaty of Managua and the award by the Emperor of Austria.
                            To these questions he received very evasive answers. His Excellency then
                            protested against the soldiers walking about the streets armed it being
                            quite <pb n="39" xml:id="pg_39" facs="0046"/>unnecessary and against the
                            laws of the municipal government. This appears to have given great
                            offense. No doubt the incident was misrepresented to the Nicaraguan
                            Government, and the commissioner received secret instructions to take
                            the bold step spoken of at once. If the chief had been courteously
                            notified at the very first of the expected arrival of the troops and of
                            their object, he would have used his best endeavors to accommodate and
                            facilitate their movements to the frontier while hostilities between
                            Honduras and Nicaragua were pending.</p>
                        <p>General Carlos A. Lacayo aud General Rigoberto Cabezas have now taken
                            over the whole management of affairs in the country, and have already
                            filled up the several offices for the collection of dues and taxes,
                            etc., by an entirely new staff. For these places there was no lack of
                            applicants, principally foreigners, who rushed into the scramble for the
                            plums of office. The generals are about to form a new code of laws, to
                            govern according to the constitution of Nicaragua, and to get everything
                            in working order before there is any investigation by Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s Government.</p>
                        <p>Business is almost at a standstill, and many people have closed their
                            houses and taken refuge in the bush and up the rivers. Terror prevails
                            where a few months ago all felt secure and happy. To add to this chaotic
                            state of affairs, another revolution has broken out in the interior.</p>
                        <p>I also earnestly wish to call the special attention of England to the
                            Moravian mission churches and schools that have been so long established
                            in the country and supported in every way by the Mosquito Government,
                            who gave annually a handsome donation from the treasury toward their
                            support. This institution, which stands alone, has done much noble work
                            among the Indians in educating them both spiritually and morally, and so
                            bringing them gradually to a state of civilization. What is to become of
                            them in a country where Protestantism is merely tolerated and the
                            Sabbath only observed as a holiday, with drinking, gambling, bullfights,
                            heavy betting around a cockpit, and reveling and fighting in the
                            streets? Is this little Territory, that was at peace with the whole
                            world, to be brought within the jurisdiction of a country that is always
                            in a state of revolution and turmoil? Are all the enterprises that were
                            built upon the existence of the treaty to diminish and gradually die
                            out? A great deal of pressure will be brought to bear in many ways upon
                            the merchants and residents that will compel them to quit, and so make
                            room for the Spaniards to come in and fill up the vacancy.</p>
                        <p>Having laid before your readers the true facts of our present situation,
                            I would advise England for the sake of her honor to take immediate steps
                            to relieve a people from a future serfdom, and a prosperous little
                            country from ruin, by a thorough investigation of all the wrongs this
                            country has suffered, and insist upon the whole of the treaty of Managua
                            and the award by the Emperor of Austria being carried out faithfully by
                            Nicaragua. Even for diplomatic reasons she should not relax her hold in
                            this little spot of Central America, which eventually she may need. Her
                            Britannic Majesty’s pro-vice-consul and the United States consular agent
                            are doing their very best, in the interests of the people they
                            represent, with the limited powers they have at their disposal.</p>
                        <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">February</hi> 25.</p>
                        <p>Early this morning Her Majesty’s ship <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>
                            arrived from Grey Town with Mr. H. F. Bingham, the British consul, on
                            board. Capt. Assheton G. Curzon Howe, R. N., accompanied by his
                            secretary, came <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0047"/>ashore with
                            important dispatches to the Nicaraguan commissioner. Mr. E. D. Hatch,
                            Her Britannic Majesty’s pro-vice consul, introduced the officers to Gen.
                            Carlos A. Lacayo. On their return to the British vice-consulate,
                            accompanied by a peaceable crowd, the Nicaraguan soldiers rushed down,
                            shouting “Viva Nicaragua!” to disperse them with loaded revolvers and
                            riles, for the martial law forbids an assemblage of persons either
                            walking or standing about. Fortunately an officer saw the danger that
                            might arise, and stopped it just in time.</p>
                        <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">February</hi> 26.</p>
                        <p>A meeting of investigation was held on shore to day, Capt. A. G. C. Howe,
                            R. N., and Mr. H. F. Bingham, British consul, representing Her Britannic
                            Majesty, and Gen. Carlos A. Lacayo, the commissioner, representing the
                            Republic of Nicaragua. The British representatives demanded that the
                            Mosquito nag should be hoisted again, that martial law should be raised
                            within a certain time, and that a written guarantee should be given for
                            the lives of the chief and his late officials, but none of them to be
                            replaced in office at present. The commissioner’s plea that Mosquito was
                            being misgoverned wholly by Jamaica negroes is entirely unfounded, and
                            in any case it is of no concern to Nicaragua. The chief, whose life was
                            threatened, has been in hiding since, but arrived here late this
                            evening, and is now under the charge of the British consul. He is just
                            21 years of age.</p>
                        <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">February</hi> 27.</p>
                        <p>All is quiet in town. Gen. C. A. Lacayo returned the official visit to
                            Captain Howe on board the <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> to-day. It is
                            rumored he has telegraphed for further instructions to his Government.
                            Her Majesty’s ship <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>, after landing fifty
                            marines and two Gatling guns at the Bluff for the protection of the
                            inhabitants against any disturbance, left for Colon or Jamaica this
                            evening to cable for further instructions from the foreign office, and
                            is expected to return in about four days.</p>
                        <p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">February</hi> 28.</p>
                        <p>The Mosquito flag was hoisted by the side of the Nicaraguan flag this
                            morning. All seems quiet, but everything is at a standstill till the
                            matter is settled. Many Indians, with their headmen, from the upper part
                            of the coast are arriving here every day. Before this the Mosquito
                            Government used to look after their accommodation and comfort, but now,
                            as there-are no buildings or funds, they will either have to be
                            entertained by the Nicaraguan officials or depend upon the generosity of
                            their friends.</p>

                        <p>Having been sent here by the supreme Government for the purpose of
                            arranging, on the basis of justice, all difficulties which have lately
                            occurred in the reserve, I have, in compliance with the authority vested
                            in me, issued the following decree. This decree shows distinctly that
                            the views and aim of my Government are but to give and guarantee to the
                            honest and laborious people of the reserve peace and prosperity. It was
                            with pleasure that I accepted a mission that would again bring me among
                            old acquaintances, enabling me to offer, in the name of Nicaragua, peace
                            and liberty; and if you are, as I sincerely hope, satisfied, my object
                            will have been accomplished. I desire for the inhabitants of the reserve
                            every prosperity, and this I am sure they will obtain under the laws
                            which my decree of to-day establishes, in which are included the
                            strongest guarantees and the highest privileges.</p>

                        <p>Considering that on the 19th instant the commissioner of the Republic
                            agreed with Her Britannic Majesty’s consul upon a <hi rend="italic"
                                >provisional</hi> contract for the government of the Mosquito

                            territory;</p>
                        <p>Considering that this contract was imposed by the circumstances and

                            the <hi rend="italic">decree</hi> dated the 12th of February last;</p>
                        <p>Considering that the present condition of affairs being investigated, any
                            substantial change that would be made to the said contract would cause
                            new stir and difficulties, which the commissioner is bound to avoid; and
                            having only in view to grant all those guaranties, lead to establish the
                            public confidence, to regulate the trade, and secure the order and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honorable Sir</hi>: Whereas we, the American
                            citizens resident here, have been requested by your honor to put forth
                            our wishes, desires, and grievances in reference to the unsettled
                            condition of affairs in the Mosquito Reservation, by these presents do
                            respectfully call your attention to the following facts:</p>
                        <p>We have come here under the guaranties and liberal privileges extended to
                            us by the treaty of Managua of 1860, and have consequently invested our
                            capital, intelligence, and labor, which is now jeopardized by the events
                            which have happened since the 12th of February.</p>
                        <p>On that date Nicaraguan troops, under the command of the Nicaraguan
                            commissioner and the newly appointed inspector-general of the Atlantic
                            coast of Nicaragua, took possession of the town and reservation, deposed
                            the authorities, and put the place under martial law, when there had not
                            been nor was any resistance at all offered to them.</p>
                        <p>Once the authorities removed, they took possession of all public
                            buildings and property of the Mosquito Government, and, opening the
                            prison doors, set free the felons therein upon the community.</p>
                        <p>The soldiers were undisciplined and fanatic, and could not be controlled
                            by their officers, and committed various outrages.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants were nigh driven to desperation and a condition ensued
                            winch endangered life and property.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner, although immediately setting about the collection and
                            imposition of duties and taxes, refused on the other hand to recognize
                            the valid obligations of the Mosquito Government.</p>
                        <p>He remarked that he would just run things to suit himself, and if people
                            did not like it they could leave the country.</p>
                        <p>Again, he threatened to take lands owned by the natives and sell it.</p>
                        <p>Miners holding titles to their claims under and from the Mosquito
                            Government were warned by him that their grants would not be recognized,
                            and, in fact, he expressed himself to the effect that likely all the
                            leases, titles, contracts, and concessions would be void and not
                            recognized by his government.</p>
                        <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0050"/>
                        <p>The commissioner has deceived the people so frequently that they have
                            lost all confidence in him.</p>
                        <p>This menacing conduct and threats frightened the natives until nearly 150
                            families have left the reserve.</p>
                        <p>The labor of the country is composed of such people as have thus gone
                            away, which is likewise ruinous to the commerce of the port.</p>
                        <p>It has also been made imminent that a change of the language would be
                            enforced, and this would work a great hardship on everyone.</p>
                        <p>The duties and export tax which the commissioner placed on fruit can not
                            be considered but to the detriment of the fruit trade, the leading
                            industry of the country.</p>
                        <p>Neither can we judge it judicious that small crafts plying between local
                            ports are compelled to take out papers at exorbitant rates.</p>
                        <p>Duties have been charged on goods taken to other points in the reserve,
                            when said goods had already paid duties in Bluehelds.</p>
                        <p>In Rama the treatment of Americans has been such that we feel assured,
                            should Nicaragua govern the reserve, we would receive the same
                            treatment.</p>
                        <p>The fruit business in Rama has been seriously hampered by the petty
                            decrees of her governors, and the continued detention of steamers,
                            barges, etc., loaded with fruit have caused heavy losses to the ship
                            agents.</p>
                        <p>Captains of steamers and barges have been heavily fined for passing the
                            custom-house at Rama after having asked permission, which was refused,
                            and having leaky barges, they would have lost barge loads of fruit by
                            the next morning.</p>
                        <p>We also particularly denounce the foul murder; of William Wilson in Rama,
                            and demand that his assassin be punished as this crime deserves.</p>
                        <p>We are not devoid of experience; the wretched state of Grey Town, San
                            Jacinto, and Cape Gracios a Dios is a mark of warning, and while we are
                            peaceful and law-abiding citizens in this community, and do not wish to
                            antagonize Nicaragua, and with all due deference to her sovereign
                            rights, we desire to have here a local self-government (free from the
                            frequent revolutions which occur in the interior) based on the lines
                            laid down by the treaty of Managua.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: The Minister of the Interior has
                            addressed himself to this secretaryship informing it that the
                            commissioner of the Mosquito Reservation has given him notice that on
                            the 20th of last March, about 10 o’clock in the evening, Mr. Norberto
                            Argiiello, police inspector, temporarily in charge of the Government,
                            seriously wounded the American citizen William Wilson.</p>
                        <p>In bringing to the knowledge of Your Excellency this deplorable incident,
                            of which my Government has not, as yet, any details, it is my duty to
                            manifest to Your Excellency that Mr. Argüello was immediately deposed,
                            and that the commissioner appointed Col. L’uis Cartin in his place, who
                            will carry on the legal prosecution so that the culprit may be
                            punished.</p>
                        <p>The Government on its part, desirous that full justice be administered in
                            the affair, has sent, through the honorable minister of the interior,
                            telegrams to Ban Juan del Norte and Bluefields, of which I inclose to
                            Your Excellency an authorized copy.</p>
                        <p>I will not close this communication without deploring what has come to
                            pass, and without manifesting that, as soon as the Government receives
                            information which it has called for, I will again address myself to Your

                        <p>With much regret the executive has been informed of your telegram, dated
                            the 31st of last month, in which you give an account of the wound
                            inflicted on the American citizen, Wilson, by the temporary governor,
                            Argüello.</p>
                        <p>The Government trusts that the courts of justice of San Juan del Norte
                            will know how to fulfill their duty by investigating the aforesaid act
                            and punishing the offender.</p>
                        <p>The Government does not approve of the practice which has been observed
                            on the coast of withdrawing the high functionaries to send them on
                            commissions; much less if these are substituted by employees of inferior
                            category, who may not possess all the qualities which those dignitaries
                            require.</p>
                        <p>The President trusts that, owing to the lamentable accident to Wilson,
                            the cordial relations which Nicaragua happily cultivates with the United
                            States of America may not be impaired. He hopes that the superior
                            authorities of the littoral will see that complete justice be done <pb

                                select those that he may deem proper.</item>

                                21 years of age, will be jury liable for duty in criminal cases; and
                                of these same citizeus a list of fifty members will be drawn with

                                the old tariff of the civic municipality. The product, or what may
                                be the same, the money collected, will be delivered to the
                                treasurer, who will pay the disbursement only on the order of the
                                commissioner; but the net product of the rents can only be used in
                                the proper expenses of the reserve or in the improving of the public
                                works, such as ways of communications, etc.</item>

                                preside, the council will appoint the person that shall replace

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a talk, yesterday, with the President of
                        Nicaragua, he informed me that this Government proposed sending to
                        Bluefields a body of 100 soldiers to be stationed at that place for the
                        performance of police duty. His contention is that Nicaragua is charged with
                        the duty of preserving the peace; and that this Government is responsible if
                        life or property should be destroyed. This duty carries with it the right to
                        take the necessary steps for the protection of life and property.</p>

                    <p>In the same conversation he requested me to inform the United States consul
                        at San Juan del Norte and also the consular agent at Bluefields of his
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>I did not discuss with the President the soundness of his position in view of
                        the various treaties; or the unusual political relations which this
                        Government occupies toward that territory. But I concluded to send the
                        letters requested, a copy of which is herein inclosed.</p>

                        <p>First British landing at bluff justifiable; the consent of Nicaragua
                            commissioners previously obtained. No claim of any right to land made by
                            the British commanding officer. Landing at Bluefields on March 6
                            obligatory and believed to be necessary for the protection of life and
                            property; the situation then critical; action of Nicaragua commissioners
                            indicate they thought it so. Commissioners joined in sending written
                            request to lieutenant British force at bluff to bring his force
                            immediately to the town to prevent riot and bloodshed and in order to
                            protect life and property. No British force on shore subsequent to March
                            20. Nicaragua in complete possession of Mosquito Reservation. Residents
                            orderly but uneasy; dread the destruction of business. Uprising
                            threatened should armed Nicaragua troops enter town; such entry
                            unlikely. There is a strong feeling against Nicaragua; Indians of
                            reservation mistrustful. No man-of-war at Bluefields when the <hi

                            uneasiness. Full report should leave Bluefields on April 18. Await

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is desired that you take advantage of your
                        visit to Bluefields to investigate the killing of William Wilson, a citizen
                        of the United States, by the Nicaraguan governor of Rama, on March 22, and
                        secure, if possible, the arrest and trial of his slayer.</p>
                    <p>From Mr. Braida’s dispatches it appears that Wilson was a drayman in the
                        employ of Messrs. Brown &amp; Harris, at Rama, and slept above their shop to
                        protect their property. About 10.30 p.m., on March 22, an attempt was made
                        by several persons, among them a policeman, to arrest a drunken man on Brown
                        &amp; Harris’s doorstep. Wilson came downstairs in his night shirt, and
                        seeing the scufflers at his door ordered them away, pushing the policeman
                        off the doorstep. The Nicaraguan governor of the city, Don Norberto
                        Argüello, attracted to the spot by the tumult, drew his revolver and shot
                        Wilson in the back as he was retreating up the stairs. He fell, mortally
                        wounded, whereupon a policeman (an American negro, named Charles Noyles)
                        attempted to shoot him after he was down, but was prevented by a bystander.
                        Noyles was arrested.</p>
                    <p>The governor ordered the wounded man to be taken to the barracks. A resident
                        physician, Dr. A. L. Chapman, was summoned by Wilson’s friends, and asked
                        permission to send a boat to Bluefields for another doctor. The governor
                        refused to allow this. Wilson died at 0.45 the next morning, about eight
                        hours after being shot.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Braida, on learning these facts, applied on the 25th ultimo to Senor
                        Madriz, who had just arrived at Bluefields as the special commissioner of
                        Nicaragua, and asked that Argüello be arrested. Señor Madriz promised to
                        send General Cabezas to Rama to deal with the matter.</p>
                    <p>It appears that Argüello was not arrested, but made his escape a few days
                        later, with the connivance, it is asserted, of the local police. Some
                        policemen were arrested for assisting his escape, but were subsequently
                        released. The policeman Noyles, who had attempted to dispatch Wilson after
                        the governor had shot him, was at last accounts under surveillance.</p>
                    <p>This incident, which has naturally produced a most painful impression, calls
                        for prompt and energetic action on the part of the authorities to secure the
                        apprehension and trial of Argüello. Ton will express the President’s earnest
                        hope that full justice shall be done.</p>

                            <item>There is absolutely nothing to show that Captain Curzon-Howe made

                                contrary, there is good evidence that the consent of the Nicaraguan
                                commissioner was first obtained before leaving the force at the
                                bluff., The latter insisting, however, that his consent to the
                                landing of the force was qualified by the proviso “without

                                occasion, when they were landed for a short time only, while some

                            <item>Captain Curzon-Howe had been begged by the American and other

                                existed between the Nicaraguan soldiers and natives might at any
                                time lead to a riot, endangering the lives and property of all the
                                residents. The good grounds for this fear of the foreign residents
                                was impressed upon him by seeing the roughness of the Nicaraguan
                                soldiers acting as police in dispersing the crowds which were
                                constantly collecting, the city being at that time still under
                                marrttel law and occupied by three hundred or more Nicaraguan

                                embarked in the <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> about 120
                                Nicaraguan soldiers, leaving about 40 regulars and about as many
                                more ununiformed volunteers, who were to leave the following day for
                                Rama, but who did not go. The same evening the <hi rend="italic"

                                belonging to the commissioner, luckily injuring no one. He was
                                attacked by the natives and beaten almost into insensibility, being
                                finally rescued by some Americans, who turned him over to the

                                consented to arrest him, and who soon allowed him to slip into the
                                commissioner’s house by a rear entrance.</item>

                                attempted to take from the people assembled their canes. This led to
                                a riot and to the firing of a number of shots, some of which were
                                fired by a party of soldier police coming up to the aid of the first
                                party. When the people had been driven into the houses, it was found
                                that one soldier had been killed and one wounded, and that a woman
                                was wounded as she was getting out of bed.</item>

                                some Americans to stop at the club, which he did for a little while,
                                urging those present to arm themselves. He finally accepted a
                                suggestion to seek Mr. Hatch, the acting British vice-consul, and
                                get him to send for the English force at the bluff. Mr. Friedlander,
                                an American, is said to have accompanied him, at his request, and
                                they were met on the way to the house of the acting British
                                vice-consul by Mr. Hatch himself and Mr. B. B. Seat, who were
                                seeking him to advise the bringing of the British force from the
                                bluff for protection. The commissioner was asked by Mr. Hatch <gap

                            <item>The United States consular agent, Mr. B. B. Seat, accompanied by
                                Mr. Samuel Weil, left for Washington this day, March 20, as
                                delegates appointed by the American residents hereto urge our
                                Government to protect their interests and rights in the present
                                complications. The same day the United States consul, Braida, having
                                declined to appoint anyone a member of the provisional council, two
                                Americans (Mr. Weinberger and Mr. Higley) were notified by the
                                Nicaraguan commissioner that they were members of the council. The
                                former called a meeting to find out if it was their unanimous wish
                                that they should represent them. At this meeting the American
                                residents passed resolutions, a copy of which is inclosed herewith,
                                marked L. After these resolutions were passed Mr. Weinberger
                                declined to serve.</item>

                            <item>March 21 the steamer <hi rend="italic">Hendy</hi> arrived from
                                Rama with about 30 soldiers on board, their arms being on the same
                                steamer in boxes, causing great excitement. They were, however,
                                lauded without trouble when it was understood that the commissioner
                                had consented to their arms being taken to the bluff. Mr. Weinberger
                                escorted the soldiers to the commissioner’s house, where, it is
                                claimed, the commissioner had promised to keep them. It is believed
                                that the arms were smuggled into Bluefields, as the boxes sent to
                                the bluff contained nothing but straw. At a meeting of Americans
                                held that night a motion offered by Mr. Weinberger was adopted—to
                                organize a force to patrol the town in accordance with the
                                permission given by the Nicaraguan commissioner united states <gap

                                <pb n="57" xml:id="pg_57" facs="0064"/>that the force had been
                                organized, but when he did so General Lacayo said that within the
                                last two hours circumstances had arisen which would compel him
                                (Lacayo) to take charge of the town with his soldiers. At this
                                meeting a speech or speeches denunciatory of the Nicaraguan
                                commissioner are said to have been made, which may account for the
                                commissioner’s withdrawal of his consent.</item>

                                residents and assisted the former, who was present at the meeting,
                                in attempting to get the Americans to reconsider their actions with
                                reference to taking part in the provisional council. While the
                                meeting was in session, with some likelihood of a favorable
                                compromise, a delegation of Americans from Rama arrived, bringing a
                                written statement, signed by seventeen American and other foreign
                                residents of Rama, addressed to the United States consul, reporting
                                the murder of Mr. William Wilson, of Brooklyn, N. Y., and a resident

                                emphatic manner, having given any pledge to anyone that he would not
                                introduce Nicaraguan troops whenever necessary, into the settlement
                                of Bluefields, asserting the right of Nicaragua to place her troops
                                in any part of her territory that she wished to, but assured me
                                personally that he would not himself call in Nicaraguan troops
                                except in caseof serious disorder; and on my expressing apprehension
                                of panic and serious danger therefrom should armed troops [come]
                                into the town in the present excited state of the people, and that I
                                trusted the respectable portion of the community would be first

                                calling in the troops, he assured me that he would only call in
                                armed troops as a last resort, but that he must be the judge as to
                                the necessity. He also gave me a personal written assurance that the
                                man charged with the murder of William Wilson would be kept
                                securely, tried, and dealt with according to the laws of

                        <p>Theodore D. Loss Rock, native of the United States, clerk to the American
                            consulate, states as follows:</p>
                        <p>On the evening of the 5th of March last about 9.30 I was in Mr. Hatch’s
                            dining room, when I heard Mr. Hatch, the acting vice-consul (British),
                            [ask] Capt. B. B. Seat to do him the favor to dictate a letter to his
                            nephew, who would write to Lieutenant Colmore, who was at the bluff with
                            marines, requesting that he would bring them on shore, fears being
                            entertained that a serious disturbance might occur.</p>
                        <p>I saw Commissioner Lacayo there and heard him say, in answer to a remark
                            made by Mr. Hatch, if the marines should he sent for, that he replied,
                            “For God’s sake, do,” or “For God’s sake, yes.” He then asked if he
                            should sign the letter. Mr. Hatch-replied that “it was not
                            necessary.”</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 6th of March I was present at the meeting that took
                            place in the American consulate, at which Commissioner Lacayo and
                            Lieutenant Colmore, R. N., were present, and heard Lieutenant Colmore
                            ask Mr. Lacayo (owing to a fear of some outbreak amongst the people) if
                            he should continue the police duties of the town, saying that he would
                            report to Mr. Lacayo all that was done, and guaranteeing the safety of
                            lives and property, to which Mr. Lacayo assented.</p>
                        <p>I heard Mr. Lacayo, on one occasion, about the 6th of March, say, “I have
                            given, permission to Captain Curzon-Howe to land his men at the bluff,
                            but without arms.”</p>

                        <p>Julius Friedlnnder, citizen of the United States of America, states as
                            follows:</p>
                        <p>That on the evening of the 5th of March last about 9 o’clock I met
                            General Lacayo in front of the International Club in this town,
                            accompanied by a crowd of armed men on their way to ascertain the cause
                            of the trouble. I with other members suggested that it would he better
                            for the General to wait until some further advice came, <pb n="60"
                                xml:id="pg_60" facs="0067"/>to know what was the matter. After
                            sometime one of his officers came and informed him of the cause. We then
                            suggested that it would be well to see the English vice-consul and have
                            the marines on shore, to which he assented. We proceeded to the
                            consulate.</p>
                        <p>We went into the family dining room of Mr. Hatch, when Mr. Hatch, in the
                            presence of Captain Seat, United States consular agent, myself, and
                            others asked Gen. Carlos A. Lacayo whether he thought it would be
                            advisable to send for the marines on shore, to which he replied that it
                            was highly necessary. Mr. Hatch then requested Captain Seat to dictate a
                            letter to Lieutenant Colmore, the officer in charge of the British
                            marines at the bluff; he also asked General Lacayo to give him two
                            soldiers with his (the governor’s) private secretary, to go with him to
                            arrange about a boat to go out, which he granted. I went along with
                            them, the boat being at my wharf. After arranging, we returned to Mr.
                            Hatch’s; the letter that Captain Seat dictated was then read. Mr. Hatch
                            then signed, and General Lacayo asked if he should sign. Mr. Hatch
                            replied that it was not requisite. We then returned with letter, and
                            sent it forward.</p>

                        <p>I certify that on the night of the 5th of March, about 9.30 p.m., just
                            after the firing on King street, I met Mr. E.D. Hatch, Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s vice-consul in Bluefields, and that Mr. Hatch asked me if I
                            thought it was advisable to dispatch a boat for the marines who were at
                            the bluff. I answered him in the affirmative, and he then suggested that
                            we go down and see Commissioner Lacayo. I assented, and we started, but
                            met Commissioner Lacayo and others within a short distance of Mr.
                            Hatch’s place. We returned to Mr. Hatch’s and went into the family
                            dining room, where I dictated a dispatch for the marines by request of
                            Mr. Hatch, and in the dispatch the commissioner was joined as a party
                            asking their presence on shore. Mr. Hatch asked him if his name should
                            be joined in the request and he promptly consented.</p>

                            proceeded on-our way.</p>
                        <p>After getting underway, Mr. Bermudez, as a representative of the
                            Nicaraguan commissioner at Bluefields, protested against our leaving
                            General Cabezas aboard the man-of-war, and said if we would return and
                            stay there two hours he would hold himself personally responsible for
                            any amount for the detention caused the <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>,
                            signing papers to that effect.</p>
                        <p>We turned back, and after anchoring alongside the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cleopatra</hi>, a ship’s boat came to us to see what was wanted.
                            The officer was asked if General Cabezas was under arrest. He said no,
                            that he was then in the captain’s cabin conversing with him. We
                            thereupon proceeded on our way.</p>
                        <p>We, the undersigned passengers of the steamship <hi rend="italic"

                            and went into the man-of-war’s boat without any force or compulsion
                            being used; that they made no protest of any kind and that no sort of
                            force was used, and that they both went of their own free will and
                            accord.</p>

                            a date as to when he can guarantee to the satisfaction of the consular

                            protect their homes and properties; such help as we in the Royal Navy
                            would be only too readily afforded by any of your own officers, in
                            similar circumstances. We do not forget the ties that connect our two

                            so gratefully received by us. The word “farewell” must now come in, but
                            with it the best wishes of the captain, officers, and men of H. M. S.

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir</hi>: In conversation with Mr. C. A. Lacayo
                            yesterday, March 22, he informed me that when Admiral Ben ham was here
                            with U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi> in October he,
                            Lacayo, signed an agreement to turn the Corn Islands over to the United
                            States Government if the United States Government would not interfere if
                            Nicaragua took the Mosquito Reserve, and also said that he had New York
                            drafts to the amount of $10,000 gold, which he was at liberty to use at
                            any time, leaving me to infer where the drafts came from.</p>
                        <p>Also saying that the United States policy was to move so slowly that they
                            were liable to lose said Corn Islands. Also that his powers were
                            unlimited—even in the matter of life and death.</p>
                        <p>Thinking it my duty as an American citizen to inform my country of the
                            above facts, I make you these statements.</p>

                            the supreme Government, They must obey the law or laws that may have
                            been issued or will be issued from time to time, and in no manner oppose
                            the authorities or attend public meeting, but to obey the officers
                            appointed to protect the reserve. This they must do in any city, but
                            more particularly in the city of Bluefields and the Mosquito
                            Reserve.</p>

                        <p>We print below an account of a public meeting held in Bluefields on the
                            31st March last, where it will be seen it is the opinion of the people
                            that a (temporary) government to carry on the business of the reserve is
                            absolutely necessary while the diplomatic settlement is being carried
                            on. We fully agree with the resolutions that were passed; but,
                            unfortunately, owing to the existence of the Bingham-Lacayo agreement,
                            coupled with the Madriz decree, it would be impossible to carry them out
                            now., It seems strange while the above agreement was being drawn up his
                            excellency the chief and his advisers were never consulted, as their
                            opinions and advice would have been most valuable and given it a tone of
                            support acceptable to the people, it being understood at the time “that
                            neither his excellency the chief or the commissioner should take any
                            active part in its business.” A great mistake was made at the first in
                            placing too much confidence in the good intentions of the Nicaraguan
                            officials-and ignoring our chief entirely. Although he may be young, yet
                            he has many good followers at hand who would have assisted him in every
                            way to keep things going, and would have been the means of bringing
                            forward good, sound representatives, perfectly willing to work for the
                            country’s welfare, who, at the final settlement, gracefully accept their
                            dismissal if the reserve should cease to exist,; and if the treaty is to
                            be maintained in its entirety, would resign with pleasure, handing over
                            the business in good order to his excellency the chief and his
                            council.</p>
                        <p>At the mass meeting which was convened at the mission school room at the
                            request of Capt. John McCafferty, and at which a prominent American
                            citizen presided, the following preamble and resolutions were
                            unanimously adopted:</p>
                        <p>“Whereas the legally constituted government of the Mosquito Reservation,
                            as defined and decreed by Article III of the treaty of Managua, which
                            reads: ‘The Mosquito Indians within the district designated in the
                            preceding article shall enjoy the right of governing, according to their
                            own customs and according to any regulations which from time to time be
                            adopted by them, not inconsistent with the sovereign rights of the
                            Republic of Nicaragua, themselves, and all persons residing within such
                            district. Subject to the above-mentioned reserve, the Republic of
                            Nicaragua agrees to respect and not to interfere with such customs and
                            regulations so established or to be established, within the said
                            district,’ was wantonly deposed by an invasion of Nicaraguan soldiers on
                            the 12th day of February, 1894, directed and controlled by Carlos A.
                            Lacayo, the Nicaraguan commissioner to the Mosquito Reservation;</p>
                        <p>“Whereas the said Nicaraguan commissioner has since the date of said
                            invasion outraged the rights and privileges of the citizens of
                            Bluefields, and more especially of the Americans and other foreigners
                            engaged in and carrying on the industrial enterprise within the
                            jurisdiction of the Mosquito Reservation, by many illegal measures,
                            which must be designated as acts of high treason against the majesty and
                            authority of said treaty of Managua; and</p>
                        <p>“Whereas the time has arrived for the said deposed government of the
                            Mosquito Reservation to resume the management of both the municipal and
                            national affairs of said reservation as authorized by the aforesaid
                            treaty of Managua: Therefore, be it</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi> by the citizens of Bluefields—Americans,
                            English, Germans. French, Creoles, and Indians—convened in public mass
                            meeting this 7.30 p.m. the 29th day of March. 1894, that the chief of
                            the Mosquito Indians, Robert Henry Clarence, is hereby requested to
                            resume control of the Government of the Mosquito Reservation; and be it
                            further</p>
                        <p>“<hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That we, the citizens of Bluefields,
                            irrespective of nationality, do now pledge the said Robert Henry
                            Clarence, the chief of the Mosquito Indians, our moral and political
                            support in the maintenance of all those rights guaranteed to the
                            Mosquito Indians by the treaty of Managua.”</p>
                        <p>The schoolroom was not only packed, but there were also several hundred
                            of our law-abiding citizens on the outside of the building. When the
                            foregoing resolutions, expressive of the feelings and intentions of the
                            good people of Bluefields, were adopted, an enthusiastic shout went up
                            from that audience of earnest men, which ought to have convinced Lacayo
                            and his henchmen that the right guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians of
                            governing themselves has not been surrendered.</p>

                        <p>Monday night at 9 o’clock, on the 2d instant, a Spanish military captain
                            named—was shot at a gambling saloon in this town while engaged watching
                            the play.</p>
                        <p>The affair is shrouded in mystery as being a cold-blooded action on the
                            part of some unknown person, as there was no quarreling or loss of
                            temper displayed by anyone present. The governor of police ordered the
                            arrest of every one who was on the premises at the time. The next day
                            they appeared before him, and fined those who cleared themselves of any
                            suspicion the sum of $15, after enjoying some hours in prison, and
                            detained others for further investigation.</p>
                        <p>A superior authority ordered the governor to arrest a man who was walking
                            about the town at large, upon very grave suspicions as being implicated

                                United Slates and English consuls, April 1, 1894.</hi></p>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honorable Sirs</hi>: It was to me very gratifying,
                            the manifestations of yourselves in disauthorizing in a categorical
                            manner the meeting which took plane last night, in which, as yourselves
                            know, resolutions were taken unlawfully against the sovereignty of
                            Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>On receiving the first notice of this event I did not doubt but that it
                            would fall under the just censure of yourselves. The interests and peace
                            of the community would be compromised by acts of this nature under the
                            present circumstances and would tend to carry us into anarchy, and to
                            use measures of force has always been far from my mind, because the
                            missions which have been confided in me by my Government are amicable
                            and of attraction to all classes.</p>
                        <p>Firmly expecting that with the cooperation of yourselves all temptations
                            to rebellion will he frustrated, which permits me to evade the painful
                            duty of upholding with energetic methods the rights of sovereignty “y la
                            vindicta publica” (and the public vengeance).</p>
                        <p>At the very good suggestion of yourselves to call a meeting of the
                            principal people, with the object of electing the two members (that are
                            short) to complete the municipal council.</p>
                        <p>It is my duty to make a review of what has been done, and in my methods,
                            as you can see, I have always been disposed to form a government born of
                            public opinion, because I do not comprehend, nor does Nicaragua accept,
                            any other method of ruling the people.</p>
                        <p>Immediately on my arrival I asked for the documents that were in the
                            office of the commissioner of the Republic, and I was shown a record of
                            recent events. I was sorry to find that the American citizens, who are
                            known to my Government to be good, industrious, and law-abiding
                            citizens, had refused to take part in the provisional government. As yet
                            no explanation has been given to me of the attitude taken by them. The
                            sincere friendship and the strong ties which unite Nicaragua with the
                            United States is why, in the grave questions that are now being debated,
                            have established better and more clearly, from their elevated and just
                            policy, the amplitude of the sovereign rights of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>The American citizens have very valuable interests in the reserve. Almost
                            all have made their homes here, and for this reason it is their duty as
                            citizens to contribute to the welfare of the country.</p>
                        <p>When the first arrangement was entered into between the commissioner of
                            Nicaragua, the English consul, and the captain of H. M. S. <hi
                                rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>, the representative of Nicaragua saw
                            with great pleasure that the American consul was given the opportunity
                            to appoint from among his countrymen two of the five members that would
                            compose the council, and this was reformed later in the convention on
                            which I now occupy myself, on a more liberal basis.</p>
                        <pb n="66" xml:id="pg_66" facs="0073"/>
                        <p>And the desiro was always main tamed to give representation in the
                            provisional conncil to the important and respectable American
                            colony.</p>
                        <p>In spite of perhaps excusable mistakes in those moments of uncertainty
                            these actions tended to destroy the authority of Nicaragua instead of
                            assisting her in her honest intentions.</p>
                        <p>The American consul, for reasons which he considered proper, did not
                            consider himself authorized to nominate the two members, which
                            nominations wore delegated to him.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner then called upon two Americans to act; that, is to say
                            named them, in conformity with the agreement, but his offers were still
                            declined.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas also had two conferences with the most prominent
                            merchants of the city, at which the American consul was present.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas tried to convince them of the convenience of assisting to
                            form and establish a government.</p>
                        <p>The good faith of his efforts and promises was accepted, but with all
                            this, although he was ready to concede anything which would constitute a
                            guarantee, they expressed their intention of not taking any part until
                            the arrival of the American warship, which was expected in a few
                            days.</p>
                        <p>In regard to the Indians and Creoles, I, as yourselves well know, have
                            exhausted all of the resources of reason and persuasion to bring them to
                            a good and patriotic understanding.</p>
                        <p>I have explained that the highest aspirations of the Government of
                            Nicaragua, are nothing else than to establish here a regime of order and
                            liberty, created and sustained by public opinion.</p>
                        <p>I was asked in the first conference, at which was present Her Britannic
                            Majesty’s vice-consul, to define certain points in the provisional
                            arrangement for the reserve, and they compromised themselves to take a
                            part in the council; it was urged that Mr. Lacayo should not preside
                            over the provisional Government, and that the basis of the council
                            Should be enlarged, which was much restricted by the agreement entered
                            into with the English consul.</p>
                        <p>After hearing their opinions and desires, I expedited my decree of the
                            28th instant, in which I went further than the interested parties could
                            expect, not only giving more power to the provisional council, which
                            would establish a guarantee and secure peace and good administration for
                            local interests, but also designated precise guarantees, in fact
                            privileges not enjoyed by Nicaraguans under our laws as is established
                            in Article 5 of my decree.</p>
                        <p>I believe that by adopting such a liberal policy to overcome those who
                            are agitating the minds of the people, by promulgating false reports, to
                            weaken the higher aims of the government of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>I believe also that commerce would be benefited by the suppression of
                            high duties, would begin anew, and manifest itself content under the
                            advantages of putting into effect the commercial reciprocity treaty
                            existing between Nicaragua and the United States.</p>
                        <p>But alas! what has been the response to this decree of guarantees and
                            privileges You yourselves have concurred in signifying your entire
                            reprobation in regard to the meeting held in a public building of the
                            reserve, and which for certain is in keeping of the Moravian
                            missionaries who have charge of the education of the young and of
                            religions worship.</p>
                        <p>At this meeting, called later than my decree, the authority of Nicaragua
                            was disputed; it was resolved upon to establish the former regime, which
                            means to break the peace, to disregard the agreements that were entered
                            into by the commissioner and Her Britannic Majesty’s consul, and to
                            unjustifiably and imprudently challenge the Republic of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>I can not do less than to state that this meeting was presided over by
                            Mr. Weinberger, manager of the Bluefields Banana Company, who, as you
                            know, is an American citizen and has in his charge here the very
                            valuable interests of a company also American. After such precedents, it
                            is not natural to expect much of new conciliatory measures; but so
                            emphatic are my wishes to adopt all that may tend to secure a friendly
                            solution to the conflicts that seem to intervene, and the ideas advanced
                            by you are deserving of such respect by me, that I am disposed to accept
                            them at once.</p>
                        <p>The respectable people of the town may elect two persons, whom they may
                            think most capable of participating in the council, and I shall accept
                            their candidates, arranging that the commissioner will duly give them
                            their appointments.</p>
                        <p>I do not hide from yon that I think that the assembly to choose the
                            members in question should be of such a character as to avoid any
                            disagreeable manifestations.</p>
                        <p>Hoping that we may finally enter into a period of confidence, which is
                            imperatively demanded by the commercial interests and in the interests
                            of public morality, the last beyond question is in such a depraved
                            condition that it would be completely ruined if the laws are not
                            respected, whosoever may be entrusted with the duty of nforcing
                            them.</p>
                        <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0074"/>
                        <p>I express to you my great appreciation in my own name and in that of my
                            Government for your laudable efforts in assisting me to overcome the
                            difficulties of the situation, and I rely upon this good will to he at
                            all times a firm support to the constituted authorities.</p>

                            Nicaragua had a conference a few days since with the President and
                            Vice-President of the Republic, and with the undersigned, his object
                            having been to state to the Government his views with regard to the
                            canal company.</p>
                        <p>The minister said that he thought that the said corporation, in view of

                            isthmus, and that, as he understood that the United States Government
                            did not consider it possible for it to associate its name with those of
                            the promoters of that enterprise, in the accomplishment of the work, he
                            desired to know whether the Government of Nicaragua, in case of the
                            lapse of the Cardenas-Menocal contract, would be willing to enter into
                            negotiations with the United States, with a view to settling the

                        Bluefields incident, of the 16th, and of the 20th ultimo.</p>
                    <p>It is gratifying to note your entire familiarity with the subject and the
                        discretion you have shown in treating the question with Lord Kimberley.</p>
                    <p>The confused reports of the recent occurrences which from time to time
                        reached the Department from our diplomatic and consular representatives
                        in-Nicaragua, did not permit an intelligent review of the incident, and I
                        have been obliged to await the report of Captain Watson, commanding the <hi

                        to Bluefields when the unfortunate loss of the <hi rend="italic"

                        earlier information.</p>
                    <p>I inclose for your perusal a copy of Captain Watson’s report under date of
                        April 16, with its accompaniments.<note n="1" xml:id="d40fn1">Not

                    <p>It appears to be conclusively established that the British naval and consular
                        agents in Nicaragua have joined with the Nicaraguan commissioners in various
                        arrangements for the administration of local government in the Mosquito
                        Indian Reservation. The first of these agreements, reached in conferences
                        held on February 36 and 27, between the Nicaraguan commissioner for the
                        reservation, Señor Lacayo; the British consul at San Juan del Norte, Mr.
                        Bingham, and Captain Howe, of H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>,
                        appears not to have been completed and announced until March 4, after the
                            <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> had visited Colon for the purpose of
                        receiving instructions from London. It would seem that Her Majesty’s
                        Government had cognizance of the proposed arrangement. The pro-visional
                        agreement of March 4, proving abortive, it gave place to another
                        understanding reached on March 19, between the same parties, which does not
                        appear to have been announced until approved, on March 25, by the newly
                        arrived special commissioner of Nicaragua, Señor José Madriz, the Nicaraguan
                        minister for foreign affairs, by whom it was incorporated and proclaimed in
                        a decree, dated March 28, purporting to establish a provisional government
                        for the Mosquito Indian Reservation.</p>
                    <p>These several arrangements in terms rest upon what are called “contracts” and
                        “protocols” between the representatives of Great Britain and Nicaragua. By
                        Senor Madriz’s decree of March 28, these arrangements are to last “until the
                        high contracting signatories, parties to the treaty of Managua, dated 1860,
                        arrange the needful regarding the reserved territory.”</p>
                    <p>I am unable to see that this joint assumption of authority by British and
                        Nicaraguan agents is compatible with the stipulations of the treaty of
                        Managua. By that treaty Great Britain renounced all sovereignty over the
                        reservation and recognized the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the same, and
                        Nicaragua agreed that the Indians should enjoy “the right of governing
                        according to their own customs, and according to any regulations which may
                        from time to time be adopted by them not inconsistent with the sovereign
                        rights of the Republic of Nicaragua, themselves, and all persons residing
                        within such district,” subject only to the future contingency of their
                        agreeing “to absolute incorporation <pb n="69" xml:id="pg_69" facs="0076"
                        />into the Republic of Nicaragua on the same footing as other citizens of
                        the Republic, and * * * subjecting themselves to be governed by the general
                        laws and regulations of the Republic instead of by their customs and
                        regulations.”</p>
                    <p>The stipulations exclude all idea of local government by others than the
                        Indians in the reservation. They allow no room for foreign intervention in
                        the government of the reservation, or-for the administration of the affairs
                        therein by resident aliens.</p>
                    <p>That the provisional plan formulated by the representatives of Nicaragua and
                        Great Britain provides for the appointment of American, Indian and Creole
                        representatives on the proposed governing commission in nowise alters the
                        essential character of the transaction. The arrangement itself rests upon no
                        sound basis of existing right. Its tendency can only be toward fortifying
                        the assumption that “Mosquitia” is a territorial entity with sovereign
                        rights.</p>
                    <p>The agents of the United States in Nicaragua have had no part in framing the
                        reported provisional arrangement, and they have signified their intention
                        not to participate in its administration. The proceeding has not, and can
                        not have, the sanction of this Government directly or indirectly.</p>
                    <p>I am pleased to see by Captain Watson’s report that the landing of British
                        forces in the territory was simply for the protection of life and
                        property—American and native as well as English—and that it has not lasted
                        longer than was warranted by events. * * *</p>
                    <p>With the foregoing views and the inclosed papers before you, you are in a
                        position to express to Lord Kimberley the Presidents hope and expectation
                        that the anomalous situation now disclosed may speedily cease and that no
                        foreign agency shall be permitted to dictate or participate in the
                        administration of affairs in the Mosquito Reservation.</p>

                        receipt of the note with which you have favored me under date of the 30th

                        send me copies of the important canal documents of which we spoke, and
                        express the anxious desire of your Government to see that great highway
                        between the two oceans opened up for navigation as soon as possible, and its
                        appreciation of the interest the United States have so long shown in the
                        enterprise.</p>
                    <p>For myself, Mr. Minister, I can add little to what has been so ably and
                        earnestly said on many occasions heretofore touching the deep conviction
                        felt by this Government that the completion of the inter-oceanic canal under
                        distinctively American auspices and in the interest of the independent
                        States of this hemisphere and of the world’s commerce is a necessity, the
                        importance of which is shown to grow more vital with each passing year. In
                        the President’s judgment, the speedy realization of the work is one of the
                        highest aims toward which the <pb n="70" xml:id="pg_70" facs="0077"/>two

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In obedience to your cable of the 18th of
                        April, received by me at Managua, I immediately sought to make arrangements
                        for my conveyance to Bluefields via Grey Town. After a most difficult trip,
                        changing conveyances nine times in consequence of the low stage of water in
                        the San Juan River, and the many obstructions, I arrived at the latter place
                        on the 25th of April. Capt. J. C. Watson, of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                            >San Francisco</hi>, having accidentally heard at Port Limon, to which,
                        among other points, I telegraphed inquiring for means of transportation from
                        Grey Town to Bluefields, kindly ran in and picked me up, landing me at
                        Bluefields on the 26th.</p>
                    <p>I lost no time in procuring an office and commencing a careful, investigation
                        into the condition of affairs as they exist at this time. I first invited
                        the most prominent and intelligent citizens of the place, embracing natives,
                        Creoles, Jamaicans, officers and ministers of the Moravian mission, and
                        American and other foreign business men, to call upon me, either singly or
                        in pairs. These men willingly responded to my invitation, to all my
                        questions in search of information, and in many ways contributed to my stock
                        of knowledge as to the recent past and the present condition of affairs in
                        the Mosquito Reservation. I have rigidly examined 21 of the most intelligent
                        and trustworthy citizens of this place, and had several of them prepare for
                        me brief communications in writing upon special points or phases, copies of
                        which communications will accompany this dispatch.</p>
                    <p>This is a prosperous community from Bluefields to Rama, a distance of 60
                        miles, a remarkably thrifty community for Central America—the most
                        prosperous, I think, within the five Central American States. The trade is
                        considerable already, has been rapidly growing until it received the recent
                        violent check, and is substantially all with the United States.</p>
                    <p>Its most enterprising business men are chiefiy Americans. The town is
                        American to the core. There is no semblance of the slothful, indolent, and
                        filthy habits so conspicuous in the interior towns. The houses are clean and
                        handsomely painted; the women dress neatly, and are not made beasts of
                        burden; the men are busy at useful occupations and do not devote their time
                        to petty politics, cockfighting, and parading with muskets. The community
                        has been peaceable throughout. No soldiers existed, for none were required.
                        The civil power has always had full sway, and justice has generally been
                        secured through the courts.</p>
                    <p>I will invite your attention to the fact that all Spanish or Nicaraguan
                        towns, however small, are governed by military governors; military barracks
                        are the most conspicuons buildings of the respective towns, and the marching
                        of armed men, the beating of the drum, and the <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71"
                            facs="0078"/>screeching of the fife are at all times before the eyes and
                        filling the ears of the citizens. The majority of the men spend their time
                        in places of resort, discussing politics, plotting revolutions and the like,
                        while the women earn the living.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Several places—such as Rama, Cape Gracias á Dios, and Corn Island-were
                        formerly prosperous communities under the mild rule of the authorities of
                        this reserve. They now have their military governors and-are ruled by
                        autocratic military power. The former prosperity of these places has
                        departed; their former enterprising citizens have been driven out, their
                        business ruined by crushing taxation and the lack of security to life and
                        property.</p>
                    <p>There is a distinctively antagonistic feeling among the Spanish Nicaraguans
                        toward Americans. The former are jealous of the enterprise and prosperity of
                        the latter. This is in marked contrast with the sentiments and actions of
                        the ruling elements in Costa Rica. There Americans are heartily welcomed.
                        The Nicaraguans say that Americans come here, get rich in a few years, and
                        then carry their wealth to the States. The fact is to the contrary; the
                        Americans spend money liberally in improvements which add to the prosperity
                        of the country.</p>

                            the courts, etc. This would be a grievous hardship to the

                        <item>It is proposed by the Nicaraguan Government here to sell to a company

                            which stream has had free navigation always heretofore, and upon whose

                            some twelve or fourteen ocean steamers going up as far as Rama—60

                            by thus destroying the free navigation of this river—a river which has
                            rightfully been as free as the ocean—would be an injustice, and would
                            destroy the prosperity of the entire valley.</item>

                            Mosquito. The circumstances actuating your visit may not be a pleasant
                            one, but as your calling will bring you on the platform to witness such
                            occurrences <pb n="73" xml:id="pg_73" facs="0080"/>and events as the one
                            now pending between the Mosquito Reservation and the Republic of
                            Nicaragua, I am glad you have undertaken the long journey and have
                            arrived here safe, where I sincerely hope you may be able to lift the
                            curtain and see and hear for yourself.</p>
                        <p>I arrived here (I mean in Bluefields) in the month of September, 1859. I
                            made this visit for the purpose of seeing the country and in prospecting
                            its natural resources. I had some capital, and was willing to invest in
                            any new country where I would have the prospect of locating and rising
                            with the country, as it might be developed from time to time. After
                            spending some money in prospecting the coast and the interior of the
                            Mosquito country, I found, to my great satisfaction, that the lands were
                            some of the best for the cultivation of the sugar cane, coffee, cocoa,
                            anatto, rice, cotton, Jamaica ginger, cocoanuts, and all other tropical
                            fruits including the banana, which was just then finding its way into
                            the United States markets at very remunerative figures.</p>
                        <p>I found that the forests abounded in mahogany, cedar, rosewood, pitch
                            pine, and other hard woods of value. On the coast there was a good
                            supply of turtle shell, hides, skins, canoes, cocoanuts, etc. I then
                            turned my attention to the customs, laws, and government. Of course T
                            knew the country was under the protection of England, and this, with
                            what I had seen of the people, I was satisfied that such a people, with
                            such a country, and with the aid of the inhabitants of the outside
                            world, would in time rise to some significance, also found that the two
                            languages spoken were English and Mosquito, and, as English was the
                            commercial language, that some day it would be the language of the land.
                            But best of all, I observed, to my great joy, that the Protestant
                            religion was the religion of the land, and that the good old English
                            translation of the Bible was the principal book of the schools, and that
                            the Mosquito children and all the other children were taught to read and
                            write English. I felt myself and capital safe, and with all that T had
                            seen was satisfied.</p>
                        <p>You will excuse me if I go over the historical events of this country by
                            leaps and bounds, as it would take tip too much time to speak of all in
                            the past of this country’s history from 1859 up to the present time.</p>
                        <p>You will remember that in 1800 Her Britannic Majesty’s Government entered
                            into treaty relations with the Republic of Nicaragua touching the
                            Mosquito coast. This treaty, as you are well aware, is known as the
                            treaty of Managua, which was ratified at London, 2d August, 1860. After
                            the ratification of the treaty the then hereditary chief of Mosquito,
                            George Augustus Frederick, at a public convention of the headmen of the
                            Mosquitos, and of the mixed population on the 12th day of September,
                            1861, at Bluefields, Mosquito Reservation, addressed the audience in the
                            following words (in Mosquito and then in English): <quote

                                    trust that you will be satisfied that in calling yon together I
                                    am acting for the best interests of the people who are now or
                                    may hereafter inhabit or become residents within the Mosquito
                                    Reservation. All communities of persons should have a definite
                                    and regular form of government, by which the interests of each
                                    and every person should be fully and legally protected in life,
                                    liberty; and property. Having lately made and entered into
                                    treaty engagements with the State of Nicaragua, through the good
                                    offices of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government, wherein the
                                    extent of the reservation and the civil and political rights of
                                    all persons within the said reservation are defined, I am
                                    desirous of forming a government adapted to our wants. For that
                                    purpose I have called you together in public convention to
                                    assist me in thus forming a government, and I hope that those
                                    persons who shall be recommended by you and appointed by me as
                                    the members of the general council will enter upon their duties
                                    with a firm determination to act in <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74"
                                        facs="0081"/>good faith and for the best interests of all.
                                    My wish and desire is to place the people residing upon the
                                    Mosquito Reservation—natives and foreigners—in the best possible
                                    condition as regards their present and future-welfare, and you
                                    may depend that I shall be always ready to act with yon for that
                                    purpose with the utmost good faith and sincerity, hoping by so
                                    doing to place our future government upon a firm and solid
                                    basis. And now, gentlemen, I am ready to appoint the council
                                    from and among those whom you may recommend to me for that
                                    purpose, I hope the appointment of the general council will give
                                    satisfaction to all and confidence for the future.</p>

                        <p>You will by this first convention perceive the drift of the government,
                            and that this reservation or territory, as set apart by the several
                            conditions of the aforesaid treaty, and as mapped out by Great Britain
                            and Nicaragua, and particularly described by the two contracting parties
                            from the Mosquito country, as a state of free men who are to govern
                            themselves—not as an unsettled horde of wandering savages not yet formed
                            into a civil society; not as a voluntary association of robbers or
                            pirates; but as members of this country or state they were already
                            accustomed to give to their sovereign a habitual obedience as their
                            superior, and faithfully acknowledged the power vested in him.</p>
                        <p>The members of the Mosquito state had their fixed abode, and all who are
                            acquainted with the history of America, and that of Mosquito, must admit
                            that the Mosquito Indians, and all persons residing among them before
                            the treaty of Managua, enjoyed, occupied, and governed a definite state
                            belonging to them and exercising an internal as well as an external
                            sovereignty, and were ever ready to punish evil and uphold good. The
                            treaty stipulations, taking from the Mosquito country a large portion of
                            territory and retaining to the Mosquitoes and all who may live among
                            them a reservation conceding to them their right of self-government,
                            made it incumbent on the Mosquito chief, his headmen, and all those that
                            may live among them, to adopt a constitution.</p>
                        <p>This constitution was drawn up and adopted by the chief and
                            vice-president and the members of the general council, and subsequently
                            approved by both contracting parties. Up to this time there were no
                            Spaniards within the Mosquito Reservation, to the exception of one man,
                            a Colombian, who resided at the mouth of the river “Walpa Sixah,” and
                            having a Mosquito woman as his wife. The Spaniards were universally
                            hated by the Indians, while the British and all other foreigners were
                            loved and respected.</p>

                            the court of impeachment; (2) the supreme court; (3) the local
                            magistrate’s court; and (4) the court of arbitration. All these courts
                            regulate the civil and criminal laws.</p>
                        <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0082"/>
                        <p>Grand juries are not considered necessary, therefore no grand jury is
                            summoned or impaneled.</p>
                        <p>There is trial by jury in the supreme court, both criminal and civil. All
                            trials of criminal cases are tried by a panel of six. The jurors are
                            chosen from the most respectable citizens of the reservation, natives
                            and foreigners. All persons accused of crime may at time of trial object
                            to any juror whom he may not approve to sit on the trial; if so, another
                            juror is called. As a rule all foreigners are tried having an equal
                            number of foreigners and natives as jurors. In civil cases the same
                            number of jurymen are impaneled. Defendants and plaintiffs have option
                            to demand a special jury to try their causes if they deem it necessary,
                            or, if agreeable to both parties, may desire the judges to settle the
                            case without a jury. New trials are allowed in civil matters in the
                            supreme court.</p>
                        <p>The supreme court possess the jurisdiction of a law and equity court.
                            There may be appeals from the magistrate’s court to the supreme court,
                            but the decisions of the supreme court are final.</p>
                        <p>Both foreigners and natives are prompt to answer the call of the judges
                            when summoned by the clerk of the supreme court for the trial of
                            causes.</p>
                        <p>Although there are a great many strangers arriving within the past five
                            years, yet it can not be said that crime is on the increase up to our
                            last court.</p>

                            unprincipled newspaper writers, who would lead the public to believe

                            Mosquito Indians, all of whom are chosen and elected by the Mosquito

                        <p>After the ratification of the treaty of Managua “conflicting views; on
                            the proper interpretation of the treaty commenced between the two
                            Governments, and Her Majesty’s Government, finding it impossible to <pb
                                n="76" xml:id="pg_76" facs="0083"/>reconcile the Government of the
                            Republic,” consented to allow the points at issue to be decided by
                            arbitration. The Government of Nicaragua being willing, the Emperor of
                            Austria was selected, and in 1881 the Emperor decided. It was in 1870
                            the questions in dispute were agreed upon by both Governments to be
                            settled by arbitration. (See Award Emperor of Austria, pp. 11, 12, 13,
                            22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 20.) It is sad to say that before the
                            arbitration was concluded—nay, just when it was about to be
                            submitted—the then young chief, William Henry Clarence, the nephew of
                            George Augustus Frederick, a young man, intelligent and bold, being well
                            educated, and who would be a help to his country, was murdered in this
                            town by a Nicaraguan Spaniard. This man was captured, tried, and, being
                            condemned, was hung in Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>There have been two other chiefs, Hendy and Jonathan, who have died since
                            W. H. Clarence, and the present young chief, Robert Henry Clarence, is
                            the son of the murdered William H. Clarence.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after the arbitration the inhabitants of the reserve, feeling
                            that the landbands of Nicaragua was somewhat weakened by the award of
                            the Emperor of Austria, a new enterprise was started, and the
                            long-cherished desire of tilling the soil came into operation by the
                            cultivation of bananas.</p>
                        <p>We commenced in good faith under the conditions of the treaty of Managua
                            to expend our capital, and invited foreign friends to take part, feeling
                            assured that the lands were well adapted and that the markets of the
                            Southern States being near at hand, we would be sure of success. Under
                            the clear and strong conditions of the treaty, we invested our moneys
                            and worked hard to carry out the new undertaking. In 1882 bananas was
                            the theme, and the banks of the Bluefields River were made noisy by the
                            ax of the woodman. Plantation after plantation sprung up, and in 1883
                            the planters were able to make a commencement in shipping about 2,500
                            bunches per month, or about 30,000 that year. Now, with all the
                            disadvantages of a jealous and unscrupulous people, the reservation in
                            about ten years has reached an exportation of millions of bunches of
                            bananas that find a ready market in the United States.</p>
                        <p>This great success drew large capital and capitalists from the United
                            States to come and settle in the reservation, and today, if it was not
                            for the high-handed outrage committed by Carlos A. Lacayo, the said
                            commissioner to the reservation, and one Rigoberto Cabezas, I am
                            confident that hundreds of Americans and other foreigners would find
                            their way to us, and the next year would have found us mounting the
                            ladder, and, instead of ten or twelve steamships, as we now have here
                            per month, the country would bring forth her extra millions of bunches
                            of bananas, and our harbor, while capable of affording shelter for the
                            extra ships, their return cargoes would gladden the hearts of our
                            friends in the United States, and the merchant, the man, and the
                            Government of the Mosquito Reservation would receive a fair share as
                            compensation for the prosperity of the land.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Carlos A. Lacayo come to the Mosquito Reservation some time in the
                            month of November, Shortly after his arrival Admiral Benham arrived in
                            the <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi>. Mr. Lacayo said he came to
                            Mosquito as the commissioner to the reserve. He brought a letter from
                            the governor of Grey Town, but showed no credentials from his Government
                            or President. He was not officially acknowledged when the admiral
                            arrived here, but the day on which the admiral was welcomed Lacayo <pb
                                n="77" xml:id="pg_77" facs="0084"/>was also welcomed. Up to that
                            time he had not shown his credentials, nor has he shown them to the
                            chief yet.</p>
                        <p>Shortly after his arrival he affirmed that he came to incorporate the
                            reservation, and this he made no secret of. In the month of January he
                            got together a large body of soldiers, principally Honduraneans, a few
                            Nicaraguans, and some Americans, and attempted to land arms and
                            ammunition, and did land arms and ammunition. Mr. H. U. Hodgson, one of
                            the magistrates, told him that he was wrong, and informed him that he
                            could not allow it. The chief was then informed, and a few days after
                            more troops came from Rama, and reports were all over town that Lacayo
                            had said he was about to capture the town of Bluefields. The people
                            became quite alarmed and excited, and appealed to the chief; the chief
                            then protested and informed Lacayo that he could not allow the soldiers
                            about town armed, as they were creating an excitement among the people,
                            and that there may be trouble.</p>
                        <p>Lacayo then said that they were to be sent away for the coast of
                            Honduras. They were sent away with the understanding that they were
                            bound for Truxillo, but they never went further than the cape—many of
                            the officers returning and leaving the men—the officers reporting that
                            they had a great battle with a body of Honduranean troops, which body
                            were only a few Honduraneans. In the fight three of the Nicaraguan men
                            were killed, but no Honduraneans, as both parties ran from each
                            other.</p>
                        <p>On the return of the officers from Cape Gracias most of them left for the
                            interior. Cabezas, who was thwarted in his attempt, threatened Lacayo,
                            and then Lacayo, prompted by Cabezas, sent for the next lot of troops
                            intentionally to invade the reservation and capture Bluefields. Lacayo,
                            who can not keep his tongue, made this known to many persons, and it
                            appears that it was known in Grey Town. On Friday the steamship <hi
                                rend="italic">Miranda</hi> arrived, bringing troops. The
                            commissioner told a merchant that he had on board 250 men and a piece of
                            artillery, and that if he was opposed in landing the men he would
                            bombard the town. This news of the troops weut like wildfire through the
                            town, and much alarm was caused, Lacayo seeming to take pleasure to
                            torture the weaker minds by his malicious reports of large numbers, etc.
                            The chief, seeing the danger, called together his advisers, and we
                            concluded to invite this commissioner and speak over the matter. Two
                            gentlemen were sent to Mr. Lacayo, and soon after Lacayo and the
                            gentlemen came up to the council chamber, and many questions were put to
                            him touching the reported bombardment, his position as commissioner,
                            etc. He replied in the affirmative or negative, as he deemed
                            prudent—assured the chief that it was only on account of the
                            Honduraneans that he had sent for the troops, so as to protect the
                            inhabitants.</p>
                        <p>The chief, the commissioner, and members of the council then spoke over
                            the future—the planting of coffee, cocoa, etc., in the reserve, and the
                            benefits they would prove to the country. On leaving he asked for a copy
                            of the questions. A copy was given at his request. He was not
                            displeased, and the gentlemen went back with him to his residence. Later
                            on in the day more reports sprung up and the people were excited. Some
                            time after Lacayo sent a very insulting note to the chief. We then tried
                            to quiet the fears of the people by giving them the best advice and
                            assurances. They got somewhat assured with the hope that all would be
                            well. Still, by what the chief had received and the threats which were
                            told to some reliable persons who felt that evil was intended, we, too,
                            felt alarmed. However, we could not show our anxieties, as we (I mean
                            members of the council) were <pb n="78" xml:id="pg_78" facs="0085"
                            />aware that the people were watching us, and that the least show of
                            excitement on our part may cause trouble. The troops, 160 men, were
                            landed on the night of Friday, the 10th, shouting as they went along the
                            streets, “Vive Nicaragua!”</p>
                        <p>On Saturday a delegation of Americans waited on the chief, warning him of
                            the impending danger, stating that Lacayo is premeditating acts of
                            violence, and if active measures were not taken that the inhabitants
                            would suffer. We saw the truth in what our American friends asserted, as
                            we ourselves were well informed, but we had concluded beforehand that
                            the only safe and right step would be to keep the people quiet, come
                            what may. All that we could gather was that in case of resistance there
                            should be a general slaughter of natives and foreigners and the burning
                            of the town. Seeing that we were placed in such a critical position, and
                            that the women and children could not escape, and as we had so many
                            strange women and children, as well as native women and children, within
                            the town, we fully concluded that the great object was to save life, and
                            to suffer insult rather than see one woman or one child murdered by the
                            hands of so base a bandit and their more depraved leaders. We then used
                            our best influence over the minds of the people, as we could perceive
                            that the great object was to force them to rebellion, so that they (the
                            Spaniards) may with force and cruelty exterminate the inhabitants, that
                            they may occupy and plunder. On the night of Sunday, near the morning of
                            Monday, the first attack was made. The inhabitants of the town were
                            hushed in sleep when the premeditated crime was committed, and the last
                            spark of manhood had left Lacayo. It was an inhuman crime committed by
                            the commissioner when at midnight he turned out an armed force and
                            compelled a quiet, peaceable, and defenseless people to surrender just
                            rights—the very soldiers that Lacayo said were brought to protect lives
                            and property, “as he was, or his Government was, responsible to other
                            nations for the lives of their people.”</p>
                        <p>These were the very unwashed and irresponsible men that were led against
                            the town, and at midnight took the property of the people of the
                            municipal government. These were the soldiers who were offered as bounty
                            (should resistance be made by the inhabitants) to burn and sack the city
                            of Bluefields. Early on Monday morning the people were here and there
                            gathered, looking on in sadness, and these soldiers were pushing them
                            off with the point of the bayonet, forcing them to resist so that they
                            may accuse the peaceable people of rebellion; but we have much cause to
                            thank Almighty God that the people took the advice given, and all
                            natives and foreigners kept their bauds from shedding human blood. For
                            it was quite clear that if the first shot was fired, natives and
                            foreigners would have made common cause to protect their wives and
                            children. A large body of Spanish troops again arrived from Rama; this
                            gave more cause to the soldiers to grow bold and insolent, and the
                            captain of the band, Cabezas, tried his utmost to stir the people to
                            revolt by surrounding the flagstaff of the Mosquito Government, and
                            hoisted the Nicaraguan flag. Without necessity, and without authority,
                            without any cause to suppress rebellion, but to gratify malice, and by
                            tyranny and caprice, the commissioner, Carlos A. Lacayo, and his
                            accessory, Cabezas, exereised over the peaceable and defenceless
                            inhabitants of Bluefields a lawless violence by proclaiming martial law,
                            and kept up day by day without necessity, so as to carry out and to
                            coerce the Mosquito Government, and to serve their own malicious
                            ends.</p>
                        <p>This state of things was imposed on the people with all its terrors of
                                <pb n="79" xml:id="pg_79" facs="0086"/>the situation and made the
                            more terrible by the insults of the half-clad and half-civilized
                            soldiers who were anxious of a riot so that they may have an opportunity
                            to plunder. During this time of unnecessary martial law the civil law
                            was violated. A soldier, said to be a Colombian, was, on a simple cause
                            of offense, flogged cruelly and died within thirty-six hours by the
                            effects of the flogging and other cruelties. The wife of the British
                            vice-consul was insulted; young girls who were on their way to school
                            were insulted; Mr. J. P.Moody was insulted, assaulted, and plundered;
                            the chief, Robert Henry Clarence, was twice attempted to be
                            assassinated; Mr. G. S. Hodgson was arrested; Mr. S. A. Hodgson was
                            arrested; H. U. Hodgson’s life was sought, his house entered and robbed;
                            an attempt was made on the person of J. W. Cuthbert. The taking
                            possession and appropriating the guns of the police; bursting open the
                            prison doors and letting loose on the community felons and other
                            prisoners; staying the proceedings of the supreme court while in
                            sitting; letting loose certain prisoners who were just sentenced, they
                            being Nicaraguans, and the crimes being against American citizens; the
                            taking charge of the Mosquito revenue and collecting and appropriating
                            the same to their own use; the giving to the families of the reservation
                            unnecessary sleepless nights and anxious days; the unnecessary causing,
                            through fear, hundreds of women and children to sleep in the bushes
                            without shelter; exposing infants and mothers to damp, dew, rain, and
                            mud; causing some mothers to be sick, children to be sick, and some
                            infants have sickened and died; the employing men during martial law to
                            enter at midnight the homes of an already distressed and uneasy people
                            with guns, bayonets, bowie knives, and revolvers, and, under the
                            pretense of searching for arms, with the point of the bayonet, strive to
                            ravish the women, and discharging their guns and revolvers at the men in
                            their very homes, and wounding; and numberless other outrages and petty
                            larcenies committed by the soldiers on the persons of private
                            individuals under the plea of searching for arms—these were acts of
                            Lacayo and Cabezas, and these were the soldiers they brought to protect
                            the inhabitants from Honduranean invaders. All this was done, and more
                            sufferings were endured than can be here expressed against the
                            inhabitants, unmercifully, by these malicious and cruel men.</p>
                        <p>While all this was going on, natives and foreigners were leaving the
                            country by every available opportunity—some in such small vessels and in
                            such numbers that should any accident happen and having no boats to save
                            life, all must have perished.</p>
                        <p>The situation day by day grew more alarming; persons who did not leave
                            became very anxious for their families, as no one could tell what the
                            next moment would bring forth. The fears, anxieties, wailings and
                            pleadings of wives to their husbands caused men, fathers, and husbands
                            to think, and many sleepless nights were spent in watching over the
                            safety of our homes and families. Yet we hoped and hoped in God for
                            help. We expected war ships, American and English. The American ship was
                            sent for first by Americans, and being near, all here, natives and
                            foreigners, looked with anxious hearts, but no ship. The British
                            vice-consul and British subjects had appealed for help, but this being
                            later on we could scarcely expect an early arrival; yet we did expect,
                            as is the case with all anxious hearts. The British vice-consul, Mr.
                            Hatch, and Consul Bingham seem to have worked nobly and energetically
                            and humanely. While anxiously waiting to see the American ship, as we
                            had seen by the papers that she was ordered down to these waters, you
                            may very well picture the dismay of all suffering <pb n="80"
                                xml:id="pg_80" facs="0087"/>hearts when the news reached us that the
                            good old <hi rend="italic">Kearsarge</hi> was wrecked on the Roncador.
                            The Americans were much troubled, as many were feeling more and more the
                            dishonorable actions of the Spaniards, and the situation was growing
                            worse. At the loss of this ship the Spaniards grew bolder, while numbers
                            of the inhabitants became more distressed; all believed that,
                            irrespective of nationality, there would be shown to a suffering and
                            peaceable people humanity.</p>
                        <p>All British subjects felt confident that the thing could not last long,
                            and we cheered and comforted one and the other, knowing that Consul
                            Bingham was always prompt, and that our noble Government would not, and
                            never did, allow undue means to be exercised over her loyal and loving
                            subjects longer than it could be helped. It was Sunday morning we saw
                            the work of righteousness. Early in the morning of Sunday, the 25th of
                            February, reports reached this town that a war ship was lying outside
                            the bluff. All hearts felt joy, and you may fancy the shout that went up
                            to heaven when the brave captain jumped from his cutter and landed
                            safely in this town, leaving his boat with the British ensign gently
                            floating in the wind at the stern of the cutter. Captain Howe walked up
                            to the British vice-consul and, after a short interview with Vice-Consul
                            Hatch, the captain left for the residence of the commissioner.</p>
                        <p>On his way back he was invited by the Americans at the American Club.
                            After a short stay the captain left the club, and on the way back he
                            heard a great noise; women and children were screaming, and the
                            Nicaraguan soldiers and officers howling. This was brought about by the
                            landing of the captain. A great many persons (for joy), men, women, and
                            children were walking along in the rear of the two English officers.
                            This annoyed the Nicaraguaus, and seventy or eighty armed men were
                            ordered to charge on them, and with loaded guns and fixed bayonets the
                            soldiers charged the people while the officers flourished their loaded
                            revolvers and whooped and yelled, “Vive Nicaragua! Vive Lacayo! Vive
                            Castin!” Then the soldiers joined in, each trying to bawl louder than
                            the other, shouting “Vive Nicaragua! Vive Lacayo!” pressing the bayonet
                            on the bodies of the people while the officers brought their revolvers
                            near to the heads and faces of the men. All this was done in the
                            presence of the captain, who quietly remarked, “I see I am not an hour
                            too soon.” The first work of Captain Howe was to relieve the situation
                            and to restore confidence by immediately having martial law to be taken
                            off. This was just and right to all the citizens of the reservation,
                            foreigners and natives, as there was no necessity, Lacayo, Cabezas, the
                            soldiers and officers having revolted against the chief of the Mosquito
                            Reservation and against “The municipal authority for the government of
                            the Mosquito Reservation.” It was Lacayo and Cabezas who rebelled, and
                            the undue means used by them against the people of Bluefields in
                            proclaiming martial law was an abuse of the power of the Commissioner
                            Lacayo, who, to gratify malice, committed an act or acts of tyranny.</p>
                        <p>The names of Capt. A. G. C. Howe and Lieutenant Colmore will long be
                            remembered by natives, Indians, Americans, and British subjects, who
                            were eyewitnesses and sufferers together.</p>
                        <p>These kind and noble-hearted gentlemen worked hard, and that night and
                            day, to restore order and confidence to every home and homestead,
                            irrespective of nationality. Every precaution was used to protect life
                            and property, and, although every order was carried out with boldness
                            and firmness, yet all were tempered with the greatest kindness. Ladies
                            and children soon felt it was good to indulge in the open air, and again
                                <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0088"/>we commenced to see the
                            smiles of our women and children. Fruit and flowers were lavished on the
                            British blue jackets in token of gratitude, and men, women, and
                            children—natives, Americans, and British subjects—felt sorry when the
                            gallant captain and his beloved lieutenant and the men of the <hi
                                rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> left the shores of Bluefields and waved
                            their last good-bye.</p>
                        <p>At present things seem quiet, but we know that there is a strong
                            undercurrent, and should the war ships leave us, and leave us in the
                            hands of Lacayo and all the unprincipled men who planned the revolt and
                            the capture of Bluefields, it is beyond a doubt that as soon as such
                            withdrawal is made the lives and property of the inhabitants will be
                            sacrificed.</p>
                        <p>I would ask you to view the case in all its particulars. The Nicaraguans
                            have no sympathy for the inhabitants of the Mosquito Reserve. They are
                            jealous of the prosperity of the reserve. We do not speak the same
                            language, we do not profess the same religion, and our institutions and
                            laws and manners and customs are not agreeable to them, and their manner
                            of life and mode of government are obnoxious to us; and both Indians and
                            foreigners within the Mosquito Reservation are unwilling that these men
                            shall have the rule over us. The acts of Lacayo as commissioner to the
                            reserve show plainly that there is no honor, no truth, nor confidence in
                            the Spanish element, and if left alone our lives and the lives of our
                            families and our hard-earned properties will not be sacred in their
                            hands.</p>
                        <p>I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,</p>

                                <p>The council further instructed the commissioners that all leases

                        <p>In conformity with the above law, all leases have been granted for a term
                            of fifty years, with the privilege of renewal at the expiration thereof
                            for fifty years more.</p>
                        <p>The validity of the leases, so far as Nicaragua is concerned, has been
                            acknowledged by her former commissioner, Gen. Ysidro Urtecho, who
                            applied for, and obtained by lease, the premises now occupied by the
                            present commissioner, and never objected to any leases made by the
                            Mosquito Government.</p>
                        <p>No restrictions can be placed by Nicaragua regarding the disposition of
                            public lands in the reserve as long as they are not ceding it to any
                            foreign person or state. The Managua treaty, Article II, states as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>But the district thus assigned to the Mosquito Indians may not be
                                    ceded by them to any foreign person or state, but shall be and
                                    remain under the sovereignty of the Republic of Nicaragua.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The relative position of Mosquito to Nicaragua is that of a coexisting
                            sovereignty, as demonstrated by the flag of Mosquito, and which has been
                            clearly set forth in the treaty of Managua, Article III, and the award
                            of His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of Austria, in his arbitration of
                            certain questions relative to the affairs of Mosquito.</p>
                        <p>The decision of the Emperor has been accepted by Nicaragua but never
                            acted upon fully, and the present occupation of the Mosquito Reserve by
                            the Nicaraguan commissioner and his employees, demonstrates the fact
                            that the solemn engagements of that Republic can be wilfully violated by
                            them at pleasure.</p>
                        <p>To-day Mosquito is regarded either as the prey or the enemy of Nicaragua,
                            by said Government, and it is only the presence of either British or
                            American war ships that guarantees protection of our lives.</p>
                        <p>We are confident that the British Government will insist on the
                            fulfillment of the above quoted treaty stipulations.</p>
                        <p>Although having heard to the contrary from those interested in our
                            downfall, we are confident that the United States of America, for the
                            sake of liberty, as well as for the interests of her citizens residing
                            and doing business in this country, will use every means in her power to
                            assist in bringing this matter of ours to a satisfactory
                            termination.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: We, the undersigned, being called upon to
                            give our personal opinion with regard to the present state of affairs in
                            the Mosquito Reservation, and with regard to the future prospects of the
                            same, beg leave to state that we do so somewhat reluctantly, as our
                            missionary calling forbids us to have any dealings with politics.</p>
                        <p>The Evangelical Church of the United Brethren, commonly called the
                            “Moravian Church,” has carried on mission work in this country for these
                            forty-five years. The Moravian Mission on this coast comprises at
                            present 13 congregations, numbering 5,500 souls—75 per cent Indians, 25
                            per cent colored people—whilst 700 children are being taught in 15
                            schools, 14 of which are elementary schools, one a higher school for
                            advanced pupils.</p>
                        <p>This work is carried on by 15 ordained missionaries (12 of whom are
                            Europeans, 3 colored), 2 lay missionaries, and 7 teachers, at an annual
                            cost of $14,000, one-half of which is raised here.</p>
                        <p>With regard to this work we beg to state that if Great Britain, under
                            whose protection our work was inaugurated, does not uphold the treaty of
                            Managua, we should feel very unsafe indeed, as in our opinion the
                            Anglo-Saxon language, religion, Sunday observance, enterprise, and
                            commerce would be crushed out before long, and become a thing of the
                            past.</p>
                        <p>The number of our church members would also be very seriously affected by
                            such a change of government, there being but one voice among the colored
                            population, to the effect that they would not be able to live under
                            Nicaraguan ride, and therefore would rather emigrate— a considerable
                            number having already taken steps in this direction.</p>
                        <p>The Indians are of the same opinion concerning a Nicaraguan rule, but as
                            they are of a more phlegmatic disposition they would probably not
                            emigrate. It is our opinion that they would have to expect very little
                            encouragement and receive very little benefit from the hands of a
                            Nicaraguan government: moreover, that such a change would result in
                            hastening the extermination of the Indian race, while at the present
                            time the Indians have been on the way to improvement.</p>
                        <p>Submitting this, our humble personal opinion, to your judgment,</p>
                        <p>We remain, most honorable sir, yours, very respectfully,</p>

                        be <pb n="84" xml:id="pg_84" facs="0091"/>pleased to see that the-utmost
                        harmony may prevail between Nicaragua and the canal company, and that it
                        would be much gratified if all proceedings against the said company were
                        revoked.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a protracted conversation, lasting from
                        2.15 to 5 o’clock, on Saturday, May 5, with Mr. José Madriz, Nicaraguan
                        minister of foreign affairs and special commissioner to this reserve, the
                        following historical facts were agreed upon:</p>
                    <p>Gen. Carlos A. Lacayo was commissioned by the President of Nicaragua in
                        November, 1893, as commissioner to the Mosquito Reservation, as provided in
                        the treaty of Managua of 1860. His instructions were to assert Nicaragua’s
                        sovereignty over this territory, and to take such steps as would finally
                        bring about a complete incorporation of the reserve into Nicaragua and the
                        extension of her laws and language over it. He was instructed to bring this
                        about, if possible, by diplomatic methods.</p>
                    <p>General Lacayo was accompanied by a military official, General Cabezas, who
                        was designated as “inspector-general of the coast,” an office not known to
                        the Mosquito Government nor provided for by the treaty of Managua.</p>
                    <p>On the arrival of General Lacayo at Bluefields, he recognized the Mosquito
                        Government then existing, with its chief, its executive council of
                        seventeen, its council of thirty-six headmen (all Indians), and all its
                        public officials.</p>
                    <p>General Lacayo set on foot negotiations with these officials for their
                        abdication and the turning over of the local government to him. He tendered
                        to the chief, Robert Henry Clarence, a commission as brigadier-general in
                        the Nicaraguan army, with a pledge that his salary sis such military officer
                        should be the same as his present salary as chief of this nation and that it
                        should continue for life. He offered to pension the attorney general, Mr. J.
                        W. Cuthbert, and the vice-president, Mr. C. Patterson, besides agreeing to
                        secure to them good titles and the unmolested possession of all the lands
                        and property which they owned. He also opened negotiations of a similar
                        character with individual headmen, with a view of gaining their adhesion to
                        the cause of Nicaragua, but, Mr. Madriz acknowledged, with no success.</p>
                    <p>For a space of between two and three months, while these negotiations were
                        going on, General Lacayo recognized the official authority of Chief
                        Clarence, his executive council, and the officers of the Mosquito
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>General Lacayo, having failed in his diplomatic efforts to get possession of
                        this reserve, concluded to charge this failure up to the American business
                        men of this territory. He charged the Americans with being inimical to the
                        interests of Nicaragua, in that they have caused <pb n="85" xml:id="pg_85"
                            facs="0092"/>the Indians to withhold their consent to the extension of
                        Nicaraguan rule over the reserve.</p>
                    <p>(I will remark, by way of parenthesis, that I have found no evidence that
                        Americans have tampered with or attempted to influence the Indian headmen in
                        the premises. I find the fact to be that the sentiment of the
                        residents—Indians, Creoles, negroes, and Americans—is unauimous in
                        opposition to the extension of Spanish rule over this territory. No headman,
                        no executive councilman, no chief, would entertain an idea of voting to
                        amalgamate with the Spaniards in the sense of permitting them to extend
                        their military rule over their people.)</p>
                    <p>General Lacayo, having failed in his diplomatic efforts, communicated with
                        the President at Managua, and recommended that troops in goodly numbers be
                        placed at the disposal of General Cabezas and himself, on the claim that the
                        chief and his council were disloyal to the sovereign Government of
                        Nicaragua. The call was responded to, and troops were sent. This city
                        (Bluefields) was occupied by an armed force; the executive council was
                        dispersed; the public offices were occupied by armed soldiers; the archives,
                        books, records, and papers of the Mosquito Government were taken violent
                        possession of and removed to General Lacayo’s military headquarters, and the
                        prison doors were thrown open, and all criminals were set at liberty.
                        Martial law was proclaimed by General Cabezas throughout the reserve, and
                        the territory declared to be in a state of siege. Military governors, with
                        extraordinary powers, were placed over every town and hamlet; new taxes were
                        imposed; new regulations of commerce and trade were established. Government
                        was by “decree,” and not by legislative enactment. While General Lacayo was
                        laboring under the impression that his failure to induce the members of the
                        Mosquito Government to abdicate their official positions in favor of
                        Nicaragua was chargeable to the negative influence of Americans, he
                        inconsiderately, as Mr. Madriz admitted, recommended the President to
                        withdraw Consul Braida’s exequatur.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the murder of William Wilson, an American citizeu, by Norberto
                        Argüello, the military governor of Rama, Mr. Madriz expressed his deep
                        regret that such an event should have happened at that particular time,
                        especially as it gave rise to much ugly talk as to threats made by Spaniards
                        against the lives and property of Americans. In this connection Mr. Madriz
                        admitted that Argüello’s successor as military governor of Rain a Francisco
                        Torres, had not obeyed his most definite instructions to keep his prisoner
                        closely confined in prison—that Torres had permitted him to go at large,
                        thus treating his orders with contempt. Therefore. Mr. Madriz assured me, he
                        had suspended Torres from office, and had appointed in his stead a Br.
                        Barberena, a young physician who was educated in Philadelphia, who had
                        traveled some and talks English well. Torres, although appointed to govern
                        an English-speaking town, could speak no English.</p>
                    <p>In many conversations with Mr. Madriz I have represented to him the condition
                        of unrest and nervousness created and continued by the almost constant
                        parading on the streets of armed soldiers, and the sound at many hours
                        during the day and night of the bugle and the drum. I earnestly protested
                        against the necessity of armed soldiers in Bluefields.</p>
                    <p>I stated to him the devotion of the people of the United States to the
                        principles of civil rule, the superiority of the civil authorities over the
                        military; and I stated to him the repugnance our people felt toward being
                        governed by the bayonet, by military satraps, by “decrees” of <pb n="86"
                            xml:id="pg_86" facs="0093"/>petty and usually ignorant” governors” who
                        were imported from another section of country, wereof another race, and
                        spoke to them in a strange language. Mr. Madriz acknowledged the force of my
                        remarks, and on the occasion of this last conversation promised to remove,
                        on the following Monday, May 7, all of the soldiers from Bluefields, sending
                        about 250 of them up the river and to the interior, and the remaining 50 to
                        the “bluff,” which commands the approach to the town. This has been done.
                        Our military governor, a “general” in the Nicaraguan army, is still with us.
                        Personally, this governor is a clever man, a Hollander, and speaks English;
                        but “governors’-of towns are changed with much frequency.</p>
                    <p>On Monday, May 7, I went to Pearl Lagoon, to which place Chief Clarence and
                        his two most intimate advisers, Messrs. Cuthbert and Patterson, retired
                        after the assault on Bluefields on the night of February 11. I spent several
                        hours in conversation with the three men named; I related to them the
                        historical facts agreed upon by Mr. Madriz in his conversation with-me on
                        the 5th instant, and these men corroborated the same facts, adding many
                        others which will be made the subject of another communication.</p>
                    <p>All three of these men were alarmed for the personal safety of Chief
                        Clarence, and each gave some evidence to justify his fears. On report of
                        this portion of our interview to Capt. A. C. Clarke, commander of H. B. M.
                        S. <hi rend="italic">Magicienne</hi>, now lying off” Bluefields, he came to
                        see me yesterday.</p>
                    <p>The result of the conference was his conclusion to go to Pearl Lagoon, invite
                        the chief to come down with him to Blueflelds, where he would place the
                        former under the protection of General Lacayo and would hold the latter
                        responsible for his safety. In pursuance of this conclusion, Captain Clarke
                        has gone with his ship to Pearl Lagoon for the purpose of bringing the chief
                        down. It will be borne in mind that the father of the present chief, while
                        serving in the same capacity, was poisoned, and that a Nicaraguan Spaniard
                        was convicted and executed for the commission of the crime. That event
                        occurred at the time of a somewhat similar effort of Nicaragua to capture
                        and appropriate this reserve.</p>
                    <p>Referring again to my conversation with Minister Madriz, he stated to me in
                        the most unequivocal and positive terms that Norberto Argüello, the murderer
                        of Wilson, would be kept in close confinement in this town until the time
                        arrived for his trial. Then he would be given a fair trial, and if found
                        guilty of the crime charged would certainly be punished according to
                        law.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, the 5th instant, at the very hour Mr. Madriz and I were in
                        conference, General Lacayo was at the prison engaged in taking what he was
                        pleased to term Argüllo’s “ante-mortem statement.” In this “statement”
                        Argüello claimed that in the murder of Wilson lie acted in self defense;</p>
                    <p>Mr. Madriz left Bluefields on the evening of the 7th instant for Managua, and
                        on the afternoon of the 9th the doors of the prison were left open and
                        Argüello deliberately walked out in the full sunlight. The woman with whom
                        he had been cohabiting before and since the murder, had been with him at the
                        prison the most of the day, and he was apparently in her charge. At the time
                        he left the prison she was not with him, having gone before to arrange for
                        his safety should an effort be made by Americans to recapture him. While the
                        American citizens were highly and justly indignant, I believe no effort,
                        either by the authorities or by volunteers, was made to bring him back.
                        Americans <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0094"/>naturally argued that any
                        imprisonment or trial by the Nicaraguan authorities would be a farce,
                        judging by the whole conduct of the officials since the night of the
                        murder.</p>
                    <p>My conclusions, drawn from an industrious and patient investigation occupying
                        more than two weeks, of the facts connected with the overthrow of the
                        Mosquito Government and of the sentiments of the people of this reserve,

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I desire to submit to you a letter from Gen.
                        C. A. Lacayo in regard to the escape from prison in this city of Norberto
                        Argüello, who rests under the charge of deliberately murdering an American
                        citizen named William Wilson, at Rama, on the night of the 22d of March
                        last. I also submit three affidavits-made by three reputable young men
                        personally known to me, going to show that on the day the prisoner walked
                        away from the jail, he was seen both iii the forenoon and the afternoon
                        lounging outside of the jail unguarded. His cell door was open on the two
                        occasions referred to, as was the outside door of the jail, and the prisoner
                        went and came at his pleasure. A woman, known as his mistress, had been
                        permitted to come and go with perfect freedom, and she had, it is stated to
                        me on good authority, been with him for the past several days. This last
                        fact was admitted last evening by General Lacayo, and in the same
                        conversation he stated that she had $300 or $400, and had undoubtedly bribed
                        the jailor to allow him to escape.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I now most respectfully submit that the dignity of the United States makes it
                        incumbent upon the Government to demand in unequivocal terms the removal of
                        General Lacayo from this post.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Honorable Minister</hi>: Last night, between 7 and 8
                            o’clock, I was very disagreeably surprised by receiving notice of the
                            escape of two prisoners from the jail of the city; and inquiring who
                            they were, was informed that one of them was Norberto Argüello, accused
                            of the murder of the American, William Wilson.</p>
                        <p>This incident is very disagreeable to me, as I gave very explicit orders
                            to the governor of police of this town to keep the criminal in close
                            confinement.</p>
                        <p>This employee assures me that the orders he gave the jailer could not be
                            more clear. Immediately on receiving this information I called the
                            governor of police with the object of employing all necessary activity
                            for the capture of Argüello, and to return him to jail. There are enough
                            people assisting the police to capture the criminal by guarding the
                            various points in the bush and the outlets close to the city, and to
                            intercept his passage to another point.</p>
                        <p>Besides, I have written to the authorities of the Republic in the
                            interior, so that the criminal will be captured wherever found.</p>
                        <p>In this incident I have fears that there is a hidden hand, an enemy of
                            Nicaragua, lent as an instrument to raise difficulties with a friendly
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>You must believe me, and in the name of my Government I promise that
                            Argüello will be tried according to our laws and in accordance to
                            justice.</p>
                        <p>The case was following its course. The criminal has been examined, and
                            after his confession of faults, and on Friday, the 11th instant, was to
                            have been taken to Rama for final trial before a tribunal of
                            justice.</p>
                        <p>With my highest considerations, I have the honor to sign myself,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Instructions were addressed to you on the 26th
                        ultimo, at Blue-fields, directing you to investigate the killing of William
                        Wilson by the Nicaraguan acting governor of Rama on the 22d of March last,
                        and to secure, if possible, the arrest and trial of his slayer.</p>
                    <p>Since then the report of Captain Watson, of the <hi rend="italic">San
                            Francisco</hi>, on the same subject, has been received, as also your
                        dispatch of May 2, on the general situation at Bluefields, in which
                        reference is made to the Wilson murder.</p>
                    <p>As it appears from your dispatch to be doubtful whether, in view of jhe
                        irregularity of mail communications with Bluefields, you will have then
                        received my instructions of the 26th ultimo, I send you a duplicate copy
                        thereof.</p>
                    <p>Captain Watson’s report, and the evidence in the case, leave no doubt that
                        Wilson was shot by the acting governor of Rama, Norberto <pb n="89"
                            xml:id="pg_89" facs="0096"/>Argüello without provocation; that Noyles,
                        one of his policemen, was accessory to the murder and was himself only
                        prevented from actually dispatching Wilson by the snapping of his cartridge;
                        that the dying man was most harshly treated by his unfeeling jailers; and
                        that the promises of the superior agents of Nicaragua touching the arrest
                        and punishment of the murderer have not been kept.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding these specific orders stated to have been given by Senor
                        Madriz to Governor Torres, of Rama, to arrest Argüello and hold him for
                        trial, the governor has permitted the murderer to go at large-It is
                        notorious and uncontradicted that Argüello has been at liberty in the town
                        of Bluefields under circumstances which establish the culpability of
                        Governor Torres in sheltering him from the consequences of his crime, and
                        emphasize the indifference of the superior Nicaraguan agents to their plain
                        duty in the matter. More than this, Governor Torres has replaced Argüello’s
                        accomplice, Noyles, in active police service, he having been, as you report,
                        promoted to the position of chief of police of the town of Rama.</p>
                    <p>The whole business is marked by such contempt for the most obvious dictates
                        of justice, and such disregard of the simplest obligations of international
                        duty as to call for urgent and solemn protest on the part of this
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>I am directed by the President to instruct you to demand that the Government
                        of Nicaragua shall manifest its disapproval of the conduct of its officers
                        in terms admitting of no misapprehension. You will ask that the culprit,
                        Argüello, be brought to immediate trial, that his protector, Governor
                        Torres, be dismissed from office, that the murderer’s accomplice, Noyles, be
                        dealt with according to his deserts, and that besides the atonement so to be
                        made by the Government of Nicaragua for the action of its agents in this
                        case, it shall adopt such measures as will leave no doubt of its sincere
                        purpose and ability to protect the lives and interests of the peaceable
                        citizens of the United States dwelling in the reservation, and to punish
                        crimes committed against them.</p>
                    <p>Captain Watson’s report shows that he fully understands his duty in the
                        premises and is prepared to perform it. Your course in fulfillment of this
                        instruction should make it clear that you, as well as Captain Watson, are
                        obeying the instructions of this Government.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: It is a pleasure to be able to announce my
                        safe return to the legation from my visit to the Mosquito Reservation, which
                        visit was of exactly one month’s duration.</p>
                    <p>On arrival at this place I promptly called upon the President to discuss the
                        condition of affairs in the reserve and to bring to his immediate attention
                        the grievances of my Government in the Braida and the Wilson cases.</p>
                    <p>There were present at this conference the vice-president and minister <pb
                            n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0098"/>of war, General Ortiz; the minister
                        for foreign affairs and special commissioner to the reserve, Hon, Jose
                        Madriz, in addition to the President and myself.</p>
                    <p>At this conference I was assured by all three of the gentlemen named, and in
                        the most earnest manner, that no effort would be spared to recapture the
                        culprit Argüello. I was told, also, that Argüello’s trial would not be
                        postponed on account of his escape, but that he would be cited to appear in
                        court, and that a most searching investigation would be made of the whole
                        criminal affair, and that then, when caught, he should be adequately
                        punished.</p>
                    <p>I was also privately assured by the President, in the most positive terms,
                        that he would remove Commissioner Lacayo for his part in this affair, and
                        for other reasons, in response to my numerous complaints of his arbitrary,
                        unlawful, and insulting course toward American citizens.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Yours of the 11th instant, has been received.
                        It reports the escape of Norberto Argüello, the murderer of William Wilson,
                        under circumstances conclusively showing that the assurances given to you
                        that the criminal would be imprisoned and duly brought to justice were
                        unsubstantial, and that the negligence whereby the superior authority at
                        Bluefields permitted his escape was no less culpable than the protection
                        openly given to the accused by the governor at Kama. Indeed the
                        responsibility of the commissioner at Bluefields was greater, in view of the
                        previous action of his subordinates and the solemn obligation he took upon
                        himself in the name of the Nicaraguan Government to prevent any such failure
                        of justice as Governor Torres had helped to bring about.</p>
                    <p>A telegram received from Captain Watson on the 18th instant via New Orleans,
                        confirms your statements touching the positive culpability of the Nicaraguan
                        commissioner in connection with Argüello’s escape.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gresham’s instruction of the 12th instant, directed you to make
                        appropriate demand for the removal of Governor Torres, the trial of
                        Argüello, and the adoption of effective steps to protect American life and
                        property. The course of Argüello’s immediate protector, Torres, deserving as
                        it is of unmistakable rebuke, is almost dwarfed by the astounding negligence
                        of Commissioner Lacayo, whose duty in the premises was as imperative as his
                        pledges to perform it were positive.</p>
                    <p>Senor Laoayo’s excuse that the escape of Argüello may be the work of “some
                        hidden enemy of Nicaragua, serving as an instrument to excite difficulties
                        with a friendly Government” is puerile in the extreme. His powers and
                        authority were ample to prevent the freedom which, as the affidavits sent by
                        you demonstrate, Argüello was enjoying in the open view of any person
                        passing by the jail. That this notorious state of things could exist without
                        Senor Lacayo’s knowledge is inconceivable, except as the assumption that his
                        incompetence for the high trust he holds is even greater than his wanton
                        neglect of obvious duty.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that the immediate displeasure of the Nicaraguan Government
                        will be signally visited upon this officer. The assurances you have already
                        received of the disposition of the Government of Nicaragua toward the
                        similarly incompetent and culpable governor of Rama should be a guarantee of
                        the prompt suspension and removal of Commissioner Lacayo.</p>
                    <p>The obligation of Nicaragua to put forth every possible effort to recapture
                        Argüello and bring him to justice is clear, and you will ask that this be
                        done, including the usual resort to proceedings of extradition, should he
                        have fled to another country.</p>
                    <p>I sent you a telegram on the 22d instant, instructing you that culpable
                        responsibility for Argüello’s escape is clearly shown by your dispatch and
                        Captain Watson’s report, and to ask redress and immediate effective rebuke
                        to those blameworthy; that Lacayo, having been more directly responsible,
                        his culpability appears even greater than that of Torres, whose removal you
                        were directed to demand in an instruction of the 12th instant.</p>
                    <p>You may read this instruction to the minister for foreign affairs, and you
                        may add that the Government of the United States, which on so <pb n="93"
                            xml:id="pg_93" facs="0100"/>many occasions has given proof of its regard
                        for Nicaraguan rights, especially in connection with this very question of
                        the Mosquito territory, can look for nothing less than equally considerate
                        and friendly treatment on the part of Nicaragua, and confidently expects
                        that speedy action will be taken, in the interest of mutual good
                        understanding, to remedy and punish this extraordinary action of its
                        dependent officers.</p>

                            of your Government. These instructions contain a review of the case, and

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: In a personal interview on the
                            21st instant with His Excellency the President, I was assured of his
                            purpose to do what laid in his power and in the power of his Government
                            to recapture and properly punish the escaped prisoner Argüello, who,
                            while a public officer of Nicaragua, shot down and murdered an American
                            citizen, William Wilson by name. In the same conversation, in order to
                            show the friendship of this Government for its good friend, the United
                            States, he announced his purpose of punishing the culpable officer
                            through whose lax administration, if not actual connivance, the prisoner
                            was allowed to walk out of an unguarded jail.</p>
                        <p>I have waited with much patience until this time for an announcement of
                            the fulfillment of this purpose. Having heard nothing further from his
                            excellency on the subject, I now must carry out my imperative cable
                            instructions from the President of the United States, in “asking instant
                            and effective redressand “to demand the immediate removal of Governor
                            Torres,” whose failure to obey the instructions of his superior officers
                            in regard to the confinement of the prisoner was a scandal to your own
                            Government and an insult to mine, and “the removal from the office of
                            commissioner to the Mosquito Reservation of Carlos A. Lacayo,” who is
                            held by the President “to be even more culpable than Torres.”</p>

                        transmitting the report of Captain Watson, commanding U. S. S. <hi

                        copies of sundry proclamations and documents issued at Bluefields variously
                        during the period covered by the report.</p>
                    <p>With the foregoing papers I also beg to acknowledge the precis of the
                        documentary history of the events at Bluefields, now under consideration,
                        which had been prepared at the State Department, and styled “Mosquito
                        Territory, course of events, 1894.”</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>When Lord Kimberly returned to London on Tuesday, the 22d instant, he
                        promptly accorded me an interview, which was one of frank and friendly
                        interchange of views in relation to the Bluefields incident, and the
                        position occupied by Her Majesty’s Gov eminent in relation to Nicaragua and
                        the Mosquito Reservation.</p>
                    <p>On leaving the foreign office I telegraphed you the purport of all that he
                        said, and of that telegram I have now the honor to inclose herewith a
                        deciphered copy.</p>
                    <p>Lord Kimberly gave me clearly to understand that Great Britain was
                        contemplating no extension of her influence in Nicaraguan territory nor any
                        violation whatever of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty of 1850, which his
                        Government continues to recognize as extant and in full force.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out to him the changes wrought by the lapse of time and progress of
                        immigration into Bluefields and Nicaragua since that treaty was made, under
                        which a new population had gathered there, composed of Americans, English,
                        Germans, Jamaica negroes, and others who, and whose property interests, were
                        not in existence in January, 1860, when the treaty of Managua between Great
                        Britain and Nicaragua was framed, under which the sovereignty of Nicaragua
                        over the reservation of the Mosquito Indians was fully and distinctly
                        stipulated, with certain qualifications; but the renunciation of any
                        protectorate by Great Britain over the Mosquito Indians and their territory
                        was clear, distinct, and unquestionable.</p>
                    <p>I did not consider it opportune to refer to the very questionable propriety
                        or right of submitting the treaty of Managua, of January, 1860—an instrument
                        dealing wholly with Central American jurisdiction and, interests, which were
                        also manifestly within the purview and scope of the anterior Clayton-Bulwer
                        treaty—to the arbitrament of a European power (Austria) without notice to
                        the United States, or inviting that power to come into the consultation
                        respecting interests which were the subject-matter of existing treaty
                        stipulations between Great Britain and the United States; and not being a
                        party to any such arbitration, the United States were in no way bound to the
                        award.</p>
                    <p>I preferred, upon the broad but well-defined provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer
                        treaty, to treat all British protectorates in Central America as long since
                        at an end, and never to be renewed in any shape, form, or degree.</p>
                    <p>I also drew his lordship’s attention to the fact that, in the history of this
                        last incident of disorder at Bluefields, which led to the landing of an
                        armed British force, no question as to the right of the Mosquito Indians
                        being governed by their own customs and regulations, as established in their
                        reservation, seemed to have arisen; and yet it was to such “customs and
                        regulations” alone that any shadowy remnant of a guaranty on the part of
                        Great Britain could possibly be argued or suggested.</p>
                    <p>And such a guaranty, or right of its enforcement, was not admitted by the
                        United States, but, on the contrary, was held by them to be <pb n="96"
                            xml:id="pg_96" facs="0103"/>inconsistent and at variance with the
                        engagements of Great Britain, under the Clayton-Bulwer treaty.</p>
                    <p>The assumption of the British consul to become a signatory to a protocol or
                        provisional agreement of a political and commercial nature between the
                        Mosquito territory and Nicaragua was a cause of surprise to the United
                        States and apparently inconsistent with our conventional understanding
                        (1850) with Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>To this his lordship replied that the British consul had acted without
                        instructions, and that it was to be assumed that nothing but instant peril
                        to the life, and property of English and other residents induced him, as a
                        kind of modus vivendi, to tide over a crisis, and by some method peaceably
                        to allay disorders and procure some settlement.</p>
                    <p>His lordship further expressed a strong desire to learn what the United
                        States Government considered it advisable should be done in the present
                        status of affairs at Bluefields.</p>
                    <p>He said the United States are, as it were, “on the spot,” and being better
                        informed could better judge what line of action was necessary to produce
                        requisite and reasonable security for persons and property in that
                        region.</p>
                    <p>He appeared to be disposed to follow in the line which should be approved and
                        adopted by the United States, so that a coincidence of view and action
                        should be arrived at by the United States and Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>Our conversation was wholly verbal, with occasional references to the treaty
                        of Managua, and some telegrams on the subject.</p>
                    <p>I believe I may fairly say that, in this conversation, Lord Kimberley desired
                        me to understand that the interposition and interference by British
                        officials, civil or naval, in the Bluefields incident—whatever it may have
                        been—was merely to keep the peace in a semicivilized region, where law was
                        displaced and disregarded, and for the purpose of securing order and safety
                        to the lives of peaceable residents of British, and also of other
                        nationalities, who all joined in asking for protection from violence, in the
                        shape of truculent and undisciplined troops claiming authority from
                        Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>His lordship incidentally mentioned (as I had previously done) the interest
                        felt in the United States on the subject of the proposed inter-oceanic
                        canal, and recognized, with apparent approval, the increased interest
                        naturally felt in the region of the contemplated work, owing to the large
                        investments of capital, present and prospective, and said the condition of
                        affairs was no doubt much better understood in the United States than in
                        Great Britain, and that his Government was desirous of knowing the opinion
                        to which the former Government might come in order that Great Britain might
                        be better prepared to act in line with them.</p>
                    <p>The interview was frank and full on both sides, and we agreed that in the
                        present status such mode of treatment of the matter was the most
                        expedient.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt in my mind that Great Britain has no desire to have the
                        Clayton-Bulwer treaty abrogated, nor to do anything inconsistent with its
                        provisions, nor to extend their influence in any way in the region of
                        country or transactions to which that instrument has relation, nor to
                        interfere in any way with the plans or works of the United States in
                        relation to the projected canal. They do not desire to have any but the most
                        friendly and mutually accommodating relations with the United States, so
                        that I believe we shall find this Government prepared to lend a ready ear
                        and to entertain in an accommodating <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0104"
                        />spirit any proposals which it may be the desire of the United States to
                        present for their consideration. Indeed, Lord Kimberley told me the British
                        ambassador in Washington had been instructed in this sense.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just received from Mr. Charles Lobner,
                        a reliable resident of Bluefields, a letter, of which I herewith inclose a
                        copy. On the 5th of May, some days before I left Bluefields, I secured from
                        the Nicaraguan special commissioner to the reserve, José Madriz, an
                        agreement that all Nicaraguan soldiers should be removed from Bluefields,
                        and that not more than fifty should be quartered at the bluff. This
                        agreement was promptly carried out on the 7th of the month. I left
                        Bluefields on the night of the 11th. Between those dates there were no
                        soldiers in the town.</p>
                    <p>From the inclosed letter it seems that as soon as I left the soldiers were
                        taken back to Bluefields by Lacayo, in utter contempt of the agreement of
                        his superior officer.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I shall immediately call the attention of Mr. Madriz and the President to
                        this breach of faith.</p>

                            that on the evening of your departure from here the bugle at the “Castle

                            suppose it will continue. Soldiers are again plenty in the town. One of
                            them was caught stealing a shirt and hat from the N. O. and C. A.
                            Trading Company’s store, was marched up to Lacayo’s by the bookkeeper,
                            and Lacayo promised to give him 400 lashes, which will probably kill
                            him.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>; On Sunday, the 3d instant, I received your
                        further cable instructions in regard to the Nicaraguan interoceanic canal,
                        and on Monday morning I made an early call upon Mr. Jose Madriz, the
                        minister for foreign affairs of this Government. There were present Mr.
                        Román Mayorga Rivas, the subsecretary, and Gen. Daniel Macauley. Mr. Madriz
                        had been out of the city for a week, and General Macauley’s letter addressed
                        to the Government, a copy of which I here inclose, had just been referred to
                        him for report. The minister informed us that he would take up the matter at
                        once, and would very soon make a written report thereon to the President and
                        cabinet.</p>
                    <p>A few minutes before leaving the legation I received from Capt. J. C. Watson,
                        commander of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi>, then at
                        Colon, a cable message informing me that he had received copies of
                        instructions, sent to me from Washington, dated the 12th and 24th of May,
                        concerning the Argüello case, and that he was ready to assist with all his
                        force. Unfortunately my latest Washington dates by mail were May 1,
                        therefore I was in the dark as to the instructions referred to; but I
                        assumed, <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0106"/>for my purpose with this
                        Government on this occasion, that they were something pretty perpendicular,
                        containing a genuine American ring. Remarking upon Captain Watson’s cable
                        and the supposed tenor of my instructions referred to, I said that it was to
                        be deeply regretted that the recent course of Nicaragua toward Americans and
                        American interests, both in the matter of the canal and in affairs at
                        Bluefields and Rama, was of such a nature as to make a most serious
                        impression at Washington of the apparent unfriendliness of this
                        administration toward the United States, a great Government which is and
                        desires to continue to be a sincere friend to Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>You express to me, Mr. Minister, your friendship for the United States, and
                        the President does the same; and then you jump on us with both feet and spit
                        in our faces. Your action in the canal matter has advertised to all the
                        civilized world your own lack of good faith and your indisposition to
                        protect the capital that would come bore and develop your naturally splendid
                        country. Nothing is so sensitive as credit; not even capital is so timid,
                        for credit—good faith—must go before capital. This is the rock upon which
                        capital builds. Your notice of the forfeiture of the canal concession, even
                        though it be upon a frivolous ground and one not warranted and not founded
                        in law, not only destroys the credit of the Interoceanic Canal Company but
                        it is the most ghastly stab under the fifth rib of the credit of your own
                        Government which could be inflicted by the keenest Damascus blade.</p>
                    <p>Your Government will, I am sure, Mr. Minister, withdraw the offensive notice
                        of forfeiture 5 but every hour’s delay is dangerous. I feel authorized to
                        say to you that President Cleveland, his Cabinet Ministers, and the
                        Senatorial Committee on Foreign Affairs are all awaiting with deep concern
                        the early and further action of the Nicaraguan Government, in both the canal
                        and the pending troubles at Bluefields. This is evidenced by the presence of
                        two powerful war steamers on your eastern coast. You must admit, Mr.
                        Minister, when you reflect candidly, that the United States has been most
                        forbearing and patient with your Government, and that their action toward
                        you has been in marked contrast with the brusque manner in which some of
                        your other good neighbors have dealt with you. I hope it is not true that
                        you have failed to appreciate this kindly spirit, that you have misconstrued
                        it, and that, therefore, you have ventured to treat us with a measure of
                        contempt which is usually only accorded to an adversary who is sadly lacking
                        in spirit, I am sure you could not have held this view, albeit your actions
                        might be so construed.</p>
                    <p>General Macauley then presented the case of the canal company to the minister
                        in brief terms, and we withdrew.</p>

                            received in New York from Minister Horacio Guzman a copy of a letter
                            addressed on April 2 or 7, 1894, by Minister Gamez to to the “Agent of
                            the Interoceanic Canal Company” in “Granada,” reading as follows: <quote

                                <p>In amplification of my communication of the 20th of September
                                    last, I have the honor of stating to you that the representative
                                    of Nicaragua in Washington, Dr. Horacio Guzman, has not carried
                                    into effect up to this date the instructions given him to sue
                                    the Interoceanic Canal Company in the courts of the United
                                    States for its failure to construct a canal on the Tipitapa
                                    River, as it agreed to do under article 14 of the contract
                                    entered into with this office on the 23d of March, 1887, because
                                    he did not want to render worse the sad condition of the
                                    company, which it was desired to help, hoping that it might rise
                                    from its present prostration; but the Government of Nicaragua,
                                    being now convinced that the rights of Nicaragua may be injured
                                    by a continuation of such a condition of affairs, and being
                                    convinced that the said contract has already been forfeited by
                                    default in compliance with one of its principal stipulations,
                                    believes that it is the Government’s duty to avail itself of
                                    article 55 of the said contract in order that a court of
                                    arbitration may decide about the point in dispute.</p>
                                <p>My Government, as I have before stated, declares as terminated
                                    the aforesaid contract, and protests that only for the purpose
                                    of adjusting itself to the provisions of the said contract it
                                    submits this point to the decision of arbitrators.</p>
                                <p>Therefore it appoints as arbitrators on the part of the Republic,
                                    the lawyers, Messrs. Buenaventura Selva and Augustin Duarte, and
                                    in case of the failure of any of them not acting, and any
                                    impediment that may arise from this time to the date on which
                                    the court may assemble, the lawyers, Messrs. Modesto Barioa and
                                    J. Francisco Aguita, will act in the order in which they are
                                    named.</p>
                                <p>I hope you will please acknowledge receipt of this present
                                    communication, because from this date will commence to run the
                                    four months that Said contract grants to the company for the

                        <p>The letter of September 20th, 1893, to which the above letter refers, has
                            not yet been received by our company, nor have we any knowledge of its
                            contents, and Minister Gamez’s letter above copied had lost nearly one
                            month before we received even a copy—the original not having yet reached
                            us.</p>
                        <p>And now, sir, in the most respectful and amicable manner, permit me to
                            suggest that whatever may have been the fault of our company in the
                            noncompletion of the Tipitapa Canal, the remedy sought to be applied by
                            Minister Gamez is not feasible, has no existence in the concession
                            itself, and I am certain will be pronounced by your friendly and
                            honorable Government as untenable and to be withdrawn and canceled
                            without delay.</p>
                        <p>Article 53 of the concession contains the five distinct and only grounds
                            of forfeiture of this concession, not one of them being in default and
                            not one of them bearing any relation to article 14 or to the
                            construction of the Tipitapa Canal.</p>
                        <p>That the concession may contain many agreements and stipulations upon
                            breach of which action or claim might rest, including article 14, is
                            perhaps true; but, as said above, there are only five permitting the
                            extreme penalty of forfeiture, and they are clearly and unmistakeably
                            set forth in article 53.</p>
                        <p>I purposely refrain from complicating this single, solitary question with
                            any other in any form, omitting all argument, counterchange, or <pb
                                n="101" xml:id="pg_101" facs="0108"/>discussion of any other point
                            as tending to direct attention from the remarkable sentence thus passed
                            upon our company and its great work. I have full faith that your
                            Government, in consideration of its friendly neighbor, the United States
                            (whose goodwill and confidence our company also enjoys), will promptly
                            remove this surprising obstruction, and permit us to go forward to
                            thorough and rapid success upon the conditions of the concession as they
                            actually exist.</p>
                        <p>We do not ask or suggest that you waive or abandon any right falling to
                            you under the articles of the concession. We are ready, separately from
                            the question of this attempted forfeiture, to consider in good faith and
                            act upon any claim you may wish to present, whether under article 14 or
                            any other, but we sincerely and respectfully protest that your sentence
                            of forfeiture, where no forfeiture can lie, gravely damages our progress
                            and tends in many ways to retard the prosperity of your own country, for
                            whose fame and happiness you would gladly do so much.</p>
                        <p>I conclude by giving you the most profound assurances that all clouds,
                            except this one, are dispelled from the company’s horizon, and that the
                            construction of the Nicaragua Canal now, without delay, is an absolute
                            certainty.</p>
                        <p>But primarily we must be released as quickly as possible from the shadow
                            of the mistaken conditions of the letter above referred to, and to that
                            end I submit the petition to your Government.</p>
                        <p>Pardon me if I modestly suggest, in conclusion, that a company which has
                            paid you $150,000 in gold and has expended over $3,000,000 under your
                            concession, might well invoke your kindly forbearance and its
                            continuance under more serious faults than yet appear against us in
                            Nicaragua.</p>

                        sovereignty over the Mosquito territory, but while conceding this, I have

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have had the honor to receive
                            your communication of the 28th ultimo, calling my attention to a letter
                            from an American resident of Bluefields, addressed to your legation,
                            referring to the arrival of armed troops and the continuation of
                            military routine in that city, contrary to the orders of removal given
                            by me in my capacity of commissioner of tlie supreme Government.</p>
                        <p>You say that this is in violation of the personal agreement entered into
                            between us on May 5 last, and condemn Mr. Lacayo’s proceeding as an act
                            of bad faith.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly it is if Mr. Lacayo, with a foreknowledge of my instructions,
                            has again brought soldiers to Bluefields, and by so doing he <pb n="103"
                                xml:id="pg_103" facs="0110"/>has disobeyed nay orders and will have
                            to answer to the Government for his acts. To that end explicit
                            information concerning this incident has been asked by the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>With the greatest respect, etc.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to yours, dated May 12, and received
                        by me June 6, I have to say: After carefully reading this communication, I
                        had a copy made of it, which I lost no time in taking in person to the
                        office of the minister of foreign affairs. I slowly read the communication
                        over in the presence of that officer and his subsecretary. In closing, I
                        repeated the reading of the closing paragraph in full, that no
                        misapprehension might possibly exist. * * *</p>
                    <p>I deemed it not inappropriate to make known to the minister, in this
                        connection, the following cable from Captain Watson, which I had received
                        before your instructions reached me: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Have copies of instructions sent you dated May 12 and 24 concerning
                                demands in Argüello case. Ready to assist with all my force.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>After the conclusion of my official visit I quietly called attention to the
                        tenor of Captain Watson’s cable and remarked that I would be pleased to have
                        this Government’s response at the earliest convenient moment, since, Captain
                        Watson was awaiting at Colon a reply from me. A response was promised Within
                        a few hours, positively that afternoon at latest. Just fifty-three hours had
                        elapsed when I received the paper marked Inclosure No. 1. I regret to find
                        no assurance in this communication “that the murderer’s accomplice, Noyles,
                        shall be dealt with according to his deserts,” or that this Government will
                        “adopt such measures as will leave no doubt of its sincere purpose and
                        ability to protect the lives and interests of the peaceable citizens of the
                        United States dwelling in the Mosquito Indian Reservation and to punish
                        crimes committed against them.”</p>
                    <p>In this unofficial conversation I stated that I was at Bluefields at the time
                        Argüello walked out of prison the second time; that it was a misnomer to
                        call his going an escape; that he simply walked out of a door that had stood
                        wide open all day and through which he had passed in and out at pleasure,
                        substantially unguarded; that his mistress had come and gone at intervals
                        during the day and for some time previous $ that he deliberately walked out
                        in the full light of day, going into the forests near by at an hour so near
                        nightfall as to make a sucessful pursuit, unless promptly made, difficult;
                        that Mr. Lacayo’s chief officer, General Ruhling, who was immediately
                        responsible under Lacayo for the safe-keeping of the prisoner, had been
                        notified by an American resident whose affidavit I had to that effect, of
                        the manner in which Argüello was left unguarded and permitted to walk about
                        the grounds, 100 yards distant from the prison building; that General
                        Ruhling made no move, until after the news of the prisoner’s absence had
                        been received, looking to a greater degree of security; that General Lacayo
                        stated his conviction that Argüello <gap quantity="6" unit="words"/>
                        <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0111"/>guard to allow him to escape, and
                        when inquired of as to whether this derelict (or bribed) guard had been
                        placed in prison for his supposed crime, replied that he had been sent to
                        recapture the prisoner.</p>
                    <p>I stated to him that I had General Ruhling’s admission, made to me in person,
                        that during the afternoon of the day following the prisoner’s walkout, he
                        (General Ruhling) saw him (Argüello) in the outskirts of Bluefields, not 100
                        yards from him; and when asked why he did not give the alarm and arrest the
                        culprit, replied with a smile that he (Argüello) did not wait to be
                        arrested. I mention this as an evidence of the lack of energy and
                        earnestness which characterized the pursuit of the so-called fugitive.</p>
                    <p>I stated further, in this unofficial way, and for the purpose of contributing
                        my mite to the minister’s information assisting him in seeing his duty in
                        the premises, that Mr. Lacayo’s everyday actions created uneasiness among
                        the foreign residents; that his continuance in office is a menace to the
                        peace of that community, and made it impossible (if there were no other
                        reason) for the United States to withdraw her war ships from those waters;
                        that Nicaragua, by the continuance of this irresponsible man in this highly
                        responsible position, was her own worst enemy.</p>
                    <p>Accompanying Inclosure No.1 are many documents bearing upon the Wilson murder
                        and the efforts to discover and punish his murderer, which I may not succeed
                        in having translated in time to accompany this in the mail which should
                        depart to-morrow. They are telegrams and orders to officers in regard to the
                        imprisonment, trial, etc., of the culprit, and throw no new light upon the
                        transaction. I shall forward them in this mail if possible, if not possible,
                        then in the next mail.</p>
                    <p>Inclosure No. 2 is a communication in answer to one I sent to the minister on
                        the day of my arrival from Bluefields, May 21. Although dated May 26, it did
                        not reach me until the 27th, too late to-get into the mail that was due to
                        depart on that day for the United States.</p>
                    <p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>
                    <p>I have, etc.,</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: The day before yesterday morning
                            I had the honor to receive a visit from Your Excellency, during which
                            you read me a dispatch from the Secretary of State of the United States,
                            dated at Washington on May 12, last, relative to the murder of an
                            American, William Wilson, at Rama, and that Government’s complaints
                            against the Nicaraguan authorities who had charge of the custody and
                            trial of the culprit.</p>
                        <p>After briefly reviewing the information received by that Government
                            concerning the incident, Mr. Gresham says that the whole business is
                            marked by such contempt for the most obvious dictates of justice, and
                            such disregard of the simplest obligations of international duty as to
                            call for urgent and solemn protest on the part of that Government.</p>
                        <p>He concludes by demanding: <list>
                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>That the Government of Nicaragua shall manifest its

                                <item>That the culprit, Argüello, be brought to immediate
                                    trial.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>That Governor Torres be dismissed from office.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>That the murderer’s accomplice, Noyles, be dealt with
                                    according to his deserts.</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>That the Government of Nicaragua shall adopt such measures as
                                    will leave no doubt of its sincere purpose and ability to
                                    protect the lives and interests of the peaceable citizens of the
                                    United States dwelling in the Mosquito Indian Reservation and to
                                    punish crimes committed against them.</item>
                            </list></p>
                        <p>On many different occasions, by word and letter, this Government’s
                            feelings regarding this matter have been explained to your excellency,
                            and the pain with which it has seen Governor Torres fail so greatly in
                            his path of duty by not complying with the demands of public vengeance.
                            Its disapproval of that officer’s conduct, demonstrated by his prompt
                            removal, as your excellency knows, has been made clear and manifest, so
                            that the responsibility resulting from his acts can not be attributed to
                            the Government.</p>
                        <p>The Government has not made those explanations merely as a matter of
                            duty, but because it wishes to demonstrate the fact that its course is
                            prompted by a high sense of right and justice.</p>
                        <p>As commissioner of the Supreme Government to the Atlantic Coast I did
                            everything in my power, always conforming strictly to law, in the case
                            of ex-Governor Argüello, and it was the undersigned who dismissed
                            Governor Torres as soon as he had evidence of his culpability. I think,
                            therefore, that the following words, quoted from the said dispatch, can
                            not apply to the officer who now addresses your excellency: “And
                            emphasize the indifference of the superior Nicaraguan agents to their
                            plain duty in the matter.”</p>
                        <p>In regard to the other remarks of Mr. Gresham in the dispatch, I inclose
                            documents which will go to prove that from the beginning this Government
                            has been animated by an unchangeable purpose of having justice done.</p>
                        <p>Consequently I decline the protest which was directed to you, and trust
                            that your excellency’s Government will find the explanations
                            satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency’s Government may rest assured that mine will strictly
                            fulfill its duty with as much zeal us you defend your rights.</p>
                        <p>Captain Watson’s telegram, a copy of which was joined to the dispatch,
                            seems to indicate the possibility of his employing forcible means in our
                            territory; and my Government sees a certain similarity between his ideas
                            and your excellency’s, as expressed to me in a recent interview when you
                            said that Captain Watson was awaiting your instructions to commence
                            action.</p>
                        <p>My Government, feeling sure that it has faithfully fulfilled its duties,
                            awaits calmly and without fear anything which may occur. In the same
                            interview your excellency explained this point to me more clearly, but
                            conforming to your desires it will be considered as a personal
                            statement.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have the honor of replying to
                            Your Excellency’s letter of the 21st instant, in which you state that on
                            your return from the Mosquito Reservation you found at the legation
                            instructions from the United States Government respecting the
                            disgraceful affair of the William Wilson murder.</p>
                        <p>After that incident, which my Government sincerely deplores, had
                            occurred, the commissioner of the Republic to the Mosquito Reservation
                            and governor in chief of the Siguia district, appointed, in place o
                            Argüello, Col. Luis Cartin, to whom he gave special instructions to
                            prosecute according to law the case against Wilson’s murderer. The
                            criminal having escaped, and the commissioner thinking there was some
                            culpability on the new governor’s part, temporarily replaced him by
                            appointing a young American named Goodel. Goodel accepted the office,
                            but there were obstacles which prevented his taking possession, and
                            therefore it was necessary for Colonel Cartin to continue in chargé
                            especially as his explanations of his conduct were satisfactory.</p>
                        <p>When the preliminary proceedings had been finished and the absent
                            criminal summoned by proclamations displayed in public places, in
                            conformity with the law relating to such cases, the governor of Rama,
                            Col. Francisco Torres, came from the interior to Bluefields, bringing
                            Argüello with him, so that his trial might be held in the place where he
                            had committed the crime.</p>
                        <p>Repeated orders were given Colonel Torres to proceed with the trial
                            strictly in conformity with the law, and that during the criminal’s
                            arraignment he should be kept in a secure prison. But having afterwards
                            learned that Governor Torres had not acted strictly in accordance with
                            my orders, and also taking into account the representations of the
                            captain of the American man-of-war <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi>,
                            I suspended him, at the same time appointing in his place a person who
                            knows how to perform his duty. On the Government’s approval of Mr.
                            Torres’s temporary suspension, it was made permanent.</p>
                        <p>In order to complete a judicial proceeding the criminal was taken to
                            Bluefields, from whose prison I have learned that at a late hour he
                            escaped.</p>
                        <p>It is very lamentable that such a thing may have occurred, but I can
                            assure your excellency that the ministry of justice has issued orders
                            for his capture, and has also instructed the judge of the case to
                            continue the proceedings; and in default, to summon the criminal by
                            edicts, and complete the case according to law.</p>
                        <p>Regarding that which refers to Commissioner Lacayo’s participation in
                            this matter, I will say that during my stay in Bluefields far from from
                            finding in him even the most trifling partiality, he always displayed
                            the greatest interest in having justice done; and I witnessed his
                            displeasure at what had occurred and his resolution to remove Colonel
                            Cartin the day he learned of Argüello’s first escape.</p>
                        <p>I have ordered a copy of the various documents relating to that affair to
                            be prepared, and as soon as they are finished I will send them to your
                            excellency.</p>
                        <p>I wish that I could inform you of the satisfactory settlement of that
                            vexations affair; but that not now being possible, I can assure you that
                                <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0114"/>the Government will
                            diligently endeavor to procure the capture of the murderer and give him
                            a legal trial.</p>
                        <p>The Government’s desire to see justice done is demonstrated by the manner
                            in which it disapproved of Governor Torres’s conduct by removing him,
                            and that it has asked for the latest reports of any responsibility which
                            may rest upon Commissioner Lacayo; for, as I have said before, during my
                            visit there Mr. Lacayo’s action in the Argüello affair could not lead me
                            to form a just charge against him.</p>
                        <p>I will take care to keep Your Excellency informed of whatever notices I
                            may receive, for I know that the reports which I have ordered will keep
                            me frequently informed of the course of the events.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received yours of the 30th ultimo,
                        communicating copy of a letter addressed to you under date of the 12th, by
                        Mr. Charles Lobner, of Bluefields, in which it is stated that the day after
                        your departure, on the 11th, soldiers were “again plenty” in the town. This
                        you characterize as in contempt of an agreement made by you with the
                        Nicaraguan special commissioner to the reserve, Senor Jose Madriz, that all
                        Nicaraguan soldiers should be removed from Bluefields, and that not more
                        than fifty should be quartered at the bluff.</p>
                    <p>The President is unable to sanction any intervention by you, restrictive of
                        the sovereign authority of Nicaragua over the territory occupied by the
                        Mosquito Indians. Recognizing, as this Government does, the paramount rights
                        of the Republic in that region, it ill becomes the representative of the
                        United States to interfere to restrain the Nicaraguan Government in the
                        exercise of those sovereign rights.</p>
                    <p>Your proper function is limited to the protection of American citizens in the
                        reserve, as in any other part of Nicaraguan territory.</p>
                    <p>You will, before now, have received, if indeed you had not already received
                        at the time of writing your dispatch of May 30, my instructions of May 12th
                        enjoining you to refrain from doing or saying anything tending to disparage
                        Nicaragua’s paramount sovereignty, or to encourage pretensions to rights
                        inconsistent therewith.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                        dispatch dated May 28 last, in which you recite a conversation had by you on
                        the 21st of May with the President of Nicaragua relative to the restoration
                        of Mr. Sigmund C. Braida to his office as consul of the United States at San
                        Juan del Norte, in the conduct of which he was suspended some weeks ago in
                        consequence of the withdrawal of his exequatur by the Nicaraguan
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>The President informed you that he had temporarily restored Mr. Braida’s
                        exequatur; but you replied that at the time of Mr. Braida’s “removal from
                        office” you had “appointed” Dr. Henry De Soto consul in his stead, that the
                        Nicaraguan Government had recognized Dr. De Soto as such consul, and that
                        Mr. Braida could not be restored to the office without first procuring Dr.
                        De Soto’s resignation, which step you did not regard as advisable until and
                        unless Mr. Braida’s permanent restoration should be assented to.</p>
                    <p>The withdrawal of Mr. Braida’s exequatur did not operate as a removal from
                        office, but only as a suspension of his authority to perform the duties
                        thereof. No vacancy was thereby created which required filling by the
                        appointment of another person; and, furthermore, a minister has no authority
                        to appoint a consul. The President of the United States alone is authorized
                        to appoint a consul, and then by and with the advice and consent of the
                        Senate. Your authority extended only to the temporary installation of an
                        unofficial person to preserve the consular archives and to perform such
                        duties as in the emergency he might lawfully undertake without authorization
                        according to law. Your action in designating Dr. De Soto to act in Mr.
                        Braida’s stead, and in obtaining local permission for him so to act, was in
                        legal effect nothing more than appointment of a custodian of the consulate
                        and archives during the suspension of the regularly appointed officer. The
                        restoration of Mr. Braida’s exequatur, therefore, whether temporary or
                        permanent, would operate as a rehabilitation of his suspended authority to
                        perform consular functions and qualify him to supersede Mr. De Soto in the
                        custody of the office, without the formality of a resignation or other
                        express determination of Mr. De Soto’s connection therewith.</p>
                    <p>You are therefore instructed to assent to the President’s offer to restore
                        Mr. Braida’s exequatur, and to permit him to resume charge of the
                        office.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: This office has received your
                            excellency’s note, No. 30, of May 7, in which you acknowledge
                            instructions Nos. 168, 169, 170, and 171.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Mosquito Reserve.</hi>—The last news received indicates
                            that the Reserve continues in a state of tranquillity, and the
                            Government intends shortly to issue a decree establishing certain
                            reforms tending to order and good government in that district, such
                            reforms, of course, having the provisional character required by the
                            state of facts.</p>
                        <p>Minister Baker has just addressed this Government with regard to the
                            arrival of Nicaraguan forces at Bluefields (Annex A), alleging failure
                            to observe the agreement he made personally with the undersigned on the
                            5th of May, and characterizing the proceeding of the commissioner as an
                            act of bad faith. I have answered him in the terms which you will see by
                            the copy marked Annex B, and I invite your attention to this matter,
                            which might possibly later on give rise to some difficulty. Such an
                            agreement has not existed, nor could it have existed, seeing that it is
                            not within the competence of the minister of the United States to
                            intervene in matters which directly concern Nicaragua alone.</p>
                        <p>To the statements of my reply to Mr. Baker I ought to add that, according
                            to a report from the commissioner, the soldiers went to Bluefields at
                            the instance of the governor of police to assist in the pursuit of the
                            fugitive criminal Argüello, whose capture was considered very difficult
                            to effect with the slender police force of that town.</p>
                        <p>The commissioner reports, moreover, having advised the American minister
                            of the motives for taking those troops to Bluefields, and adds that if
                            the force had remained there, it was because there were well-founded
                            grounds for fearing that a seditious movement might be attempted.
                            However this may be, the commissioner is responsible for his acts to the
                            Government of Nicaragua; but there is no right for the intervention of
                            the American minister in the terms in which it is expressed.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">The Argüello case.</hi>—The unfortunate incident of the
                            death of Wilson, <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0117"/>caused by
                            Argüello, is occasioning difficulty to the Government. You already know
                            the details of this lamentable affair, and are perfectly aware that the
                            Government not only has deplored it in all sincerity, but also that it
                            has done everything possible in order that the slayer of “Wilson be
                            judged conformably to law and be punished if culpable. The temporary
                            suspension of the governor of Rama, Señor Torres, which I ordered when I
                            was in the reserve, has been declared final by the Government; and
                            positive and energetic orders have been given for the capture of the
                            offender. In a personal interview which Mr. Baker had with the
                            President, the latter assured him that he would do everything that lay
                            in his power and in the powers of the Government to the end that the
                            fugitive criminal shall not escape condign punishment. This was so
                            formulated by Minister Baker in a note of which I send you a copy.</p>
                        <p>In this communication Mr. Baker asks the removal of the commissioner, Don
                            Carlos A. Lacayo, but without adducing against him a concrete charge
                            whereon to base such a petition.</p>
                        <p>You should assure the Department of State that this Government has not
                            beheld nor does it now behold with indifference the death of Wilson, and
                            you should set forth, moreover, what has been done in this affair and
                            the orders issued at the instance of my department by the ministry of
                            justice, which has notified the authorities that they are under the
                            strict duty of pursuing and capturing the delinquent. In the meantime
                            the criminal is being tried in contumaciam in conformity with law.</p>

                            the consul of Her Britannic Majesty at San Juan del Norte, Mr. Herbert
                            F. Bingham, gave rise to representations on the part of the honorable
                            English minister, Audley Gosling, who personally asked of the
                            Government, the restoration of the said exequatur, alleging that no
                            ground had existed for the determination of this Government. In the
                            field of [international] law this department could successfully defend
                            that action, but the undersigned determined to forego the purely
                            theoretical discussion to which this would give rise without any
                            positive result, and stated to Mr. Audley Gosling that he was disposed
                            to hear friendly explanations but not to accept as a justification the
                            reasons which he, Mr. Gosling, had adduced.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gosling agreed thereto, as you will see by the memorandum of the
                            conference which I have had with him, and * * * in view of those
                            explanations the Government deemed it appropriate to restore the
                            exequatur in the terms set forth in the order which I send you. * * *
                            Perusal of the memorandum shows you that in this matter the dignity of
                            the Republic has been maintained. I also send you copy of my report to
                            the subsecretary in charge of the office relative to the conduct of Mr.
                            Bingham in the occurrences at Bluefields.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Consul Braida</hi>.—Minister Baker communicated with
                            this Government, representing in a friendly and cordial manner that he
                            recognized the right, and even the justice, which pertained to Nicaragua
                            in withdrawing the exequatur of the consul of the United States at San
                            Juan del Norte, Mr. Sigismund C. Braida; but that as a tribute to the
                            good relations existing between the two countries, and in view of the
                            attitude latterly maintained by Mr. Braida in regard to the affairs of
                            Mosquito, which had been friendly and respectful toward Nicaragua, he
                            asked the restoration of the exequatur, which was done for these reasons
                            and on account of the desire which the Government has to prove that it
                            feels for that of the United States the best sentiments of friendship.
                                <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0118"/>By so doing there was,
                            moreover, avoided the unfavorable impression which might have been
                            produced in the mind of the American Government by only returning Consul
                            Bingham’s exequatur. The order by which it was directed that Mr. Braida
                            shall continue in the exercise of his consular functions (Annex P)
                            speaks for itself in explanation of the determination of the Government
                            in this regard.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>The present communication having been thus far drafted, there has just
                            occurred to-day the following incident. Minister Baker came to this
                            department in company with Gen. Daniel Macauley, agent of the canal
                            company, to state that he has clear and expressive instructions from his
                            Government to support the said compauy in its claim touching the
                            proposal of the ministry of fomento concerning the forfeiture of the
                            Cardenas-Menocal contract, that it be submitted to the decision of a
                            tribunal of arbitrators to be organized in conformity with article 55 of
                            the contract. A similar statement was made by Mr. Baker two days ago to
                            the President of the Republic. Mr. Macauley has already addressed to the
                            respective ministries a letter in reference to this matter, which is
                            under consideration.</p>
                        <p>In the course of the interview Mr. Baker said, in this ministry, that
                            President Cleveland, and Secretary Gresham as well, were under the
                            impression that Nicaragua was hostile to the Americans. And when I spoke
                            to him touching the reasons he had for so believing, he answered me that
                            it was proved by the attitude of this Government with regard to the
                            canal company, since he did not think that Nicaragua could, conformably
                            with law, declare the lapse (insubsistencia) of the contract for the
                            st#e fact of the company not having fulfilled the clause which
                            stipulates the canalization of the Tipitapa, and that in doing so it
                            would act in a spirit of opposition to the undertakers, whose credit was
                            profoundly affected by the statements of the ministry of fomento in the
                            note of April 2, last, relative to the tribunal of arbitrators above
                            referred to. That motives for that impression in the mind of his
                            Government were found in the fact that the Government of Nicaragua had
                            consented to the seizure, in San Juan del Norte, of the property of the
                            company for the benefit of private individuals, and to the grave injury
                            of the company. In referring to this Mr. Baker emphatically uttered
                            these words: “To steal the property of the company.” And he wound up by
                            saving that the conduct of Nicaragua in the Argüello incident proved
                            such hostility from the moment it supported Commissioner Lacayo, whose
                            course lie characterized as shameful (vergonzoso).</p>
                        <p>With the circumspection which was necessary, I answered Mr. Baker,
                            dispelling his charges. I said to him that on more than one occasion had
                            this Government given proofs of good will and condescension toward the
                            canal company, cheerfully lending its aid to the settlement of serious
                            difficulties, which perhaps originated with the company itself; and that
                            in the present ease, from the moment that the company had now addressed
                            the Government through its agent seeking to invalidate the declaration
                            of the ministry of fomento, I did not see that for our part the way was
                            closed to a just, equitable, and friendly arrangement in view of the
                            magnitude and importance of the opening of our interoceanic transit.
                            What the ministry of fomento desired was to safeguard the rights of
                            Nicaragua, and not in any way to injure the credit of an enterprise in
                            which the future of this country was bound up.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the embargo of the property of the construction company
                            in San Juan del Norte, in virtue of an order issued by the judicial <pb
                                n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0119"/>power independently of the
                            executive, I stated to him that I could not, in any manner, impute to
                            the Government the fault thereof; and you will recall that in respect-to
                            this particular there exists an official communication from this
                            department, of which I sent you a certified copy at the time, in order
                            that if it were necessary you might throw light upon things at
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>As touching the incident of the death of Wilson, I adduced more or less
                            fully the convincing proofs, which you already know, of the action of
                            the Government directed to the capture of the fugitive criminal, and his
                            trial according to justice by the proper authorities.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Baker concluded his interview by saying that the American war vessels
                                <hi rend="italic">New York</hi> and <hi rend="italic">San
                                Francisco</hi> still remained on our Atlantic Coast, and that
                            Captain Watson had telegraphed to him asking orders as to his movements;
                            but that he, Mr. Baker, had not sent him orders, as he was awaiting
                            instructions from the Department of State, already announced to him, and
                            which he supposed were on the way.</p>
                        <p>As it may be that behind all this there may be found something which
                            might seriously compromise our interests in the reserve, it is proper
                            that you should ascertain what truth there is in it in order to ward off
                            unhappy consequences, and avoid the upright judgment of the American
                            Government being distorted by reports destitute of truth.</p>
                        <p>I omitted to say to your excellency that upon Mr. Baker taking leave he
                            stated that if not inconvenient he would ask to have with me an
                            interview, when he should receive the instructions he awaited, since it
                            might turn out, to judge from what the periodicals of the United States
                            have lately said, that his Government might be under the impression
                            (influence) of untruthful news with respect to the situation at Rama and
                            Bluefields.</p>

                                <p>It is asserted that Captain Watson will receive instructions to

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: In a personal interview on the
                            21st instant with his excellency the President I was assured of his
                            purpose to do what lay in his power and in the power of his Government
                            to recapture and properly punish the escaped prisoner, Argüello, who,
                            white a public official of Nicaragua, shot down and murdered an American
                            citizen, William Wilson by name.</p>
                        <p>In the same conversation, in order to show the friendship of this
                            Government for its good friend, the United States, he announced his
                            purpose of punishing the culpable officer through whose lax
                            administration, if not actual connivance, the prisoner was allowed to
                            walk out of an unguarded jail.</p>
                        <p>I have waited with much patience until this time for an announcement of
                            the fulfillment of this purpose. Having heard nothing further from his
                            excellency on the subject, I now must carry out my imperative cable
                            instructions from the President of the United States in asking instant
                            and effective redress,” and “to demand the immediate removal of Governor
                            Torres,” whose failure to obey the instructions of his superior officers
                            in regard to the confinement of the prisoner was a scandal to your own
                            Government and an insult to mine, and “the removal from the office of
                            commissioner to the Mosquito Reservation of Carlos A. Lacayo, who is
                            held by the President to be even more culpable than Torres.”</p>

                            to the line of conduct he should follow, in order to give no grounds for
                            any complaint, and to efficiently protect the lives and interests of

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As I have had the honor to state to you orally
                        on more than one occasion, my Government is firmly convinced that the
                        Government of the United States has received erroneous reports as well
                        relative to the murder of the American citizen Wilson as in regard to the
                        supposed complicity of the commissioner of Mosquito, Senor Lacayo, in the
                        flight of the criminal Argüello.</p>
                    <p>The homicide in question aroused the greatest indignation in the Government
                        and in the people of Nicaragua, and public opinion was at once pronounced
                        against the perpetrator of that horrible act.</p>
                    <p>Commissioner Lacayo acted from the first with energy and diligence, and,
                        faithfully interpreting the wishes of our Government, ordered the speedy
                        capture of the delinquent and his confinement in the most secure prison
                        which exists in the reservation. At the same time he reported the
                        unfortunate occurrence to the superior authority and expressed the
                        sentiments of sorrow awakened in him by that monstrous crime.</p>
                    <p>From the investigations made by my Government there is not found even the
                        slightest suspicion that Senor Lacayo may be responsible in any way whatever
                        for the escape of Argüello, an event which he sincerely laments, as every
                        honorable man would do under similar circumstances. It is known that the
                        commissioner, as well as the other Nicaraguan authorities, has made and is
                        making all possible efforts to accomplish the capture of Argüello, his
                        sujection to trial, and his <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0122"
                        />punishment as he deserves. In the meanwhile he is being tried in
                        contumaciam, in conformity with the prescriptions of our laws.</p>
                    <p>Zealous as my Government has ever been that the administration of justice in
                        Nicaragua be speedy, effective, and equitable, it can but feel a lively
                        interest, and does in fact so feel, that the murder of a foreign citizen
                        shall not go unpunished. Consequently, your excellency must rest assured
                        that all needful means and recourses will be invoked for the apprehension of
                        the fugitive delinquent, thus averting the impunity of the author of the
                        horrible act of which the American citizen Wilson was the victim.</p>
                    <p>Your excellency is not unaware that my Government decreed the removal of
                        Governor Torres as soon as he was suspected of complicity in the flight of
                        Argüello, and that step was taken before Mr. Baker brought to the knowledge
                        of our minister of foreign affairs the purport of your excellency’s note of
                        the 12th of May last, thus conspicuously demonstrating that it acts with
                        rectitude and severity in the punishment of the guilty.</p>
                    <p>In so far as relates to Charles Noyles, my Government has already ordered
                        that he be put on trial. Thus, it may be affirmed that nothing has been left
                        undone on the part of Nicaragua to cause justice to follow its course in
                        respect to the bloody crime committed by Argüello.</p>
                    <p>In view of the foregoing statements and given (dada) the innocence of
                        Commissioner Lacayo, so far as the flight of the delinquent is concerned, my
                        Government believes that that of the United States upon learning the truth
                        of the facts will reconsider and withdraw the request that Señor Lacayo be
                        removed from his post as an act of friendship toward a sister republic which
                        has ever looked up to this great nation as the safeguard of the sovereign
                        rights, autonomy, and independence of the Latin American peoples.</p>
                    <p>Knowing the uprightness of views which characterizes President Cleveland, and
                        in view of his high sentiments of justice manifested under all
                        circumstances, my Government thinks that upon informing himself of the true
                        state of things he will wish to offer to my country an additional proof of
                        friendship and sympathy by acceding to that which Nicaragua asks through
                        me.</p>
                    <p>I beg your excellency to be pleased to bring this matter to the high
                        knowledge of His Excellency the President of the United States, and to
                        accept, once more, the protests of my highest consideration.</p>

                        <p>An insurrection has broken out at Bluefields, Nicaragua. Marines and blue
                            jackets on shore at the request of the authorities and the American
                            consul, in order to protect property of American citizens. The
                            authorities of Nicaragua have been overthrown by Mosquito chief. There
                            is less excitement. The situation is improving. I shall withdraw forces

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of yours
                        bearing date of June 30, referring to the replacing of soldiers in the town
                        of Bluefields by the Nicaraguan authorities after their removal had been
                        agreed to as a prudential measure by Mr. Madriz, the special commissioner to
                        the Mosquito Indian Reserve.</p>
                    <p>I have carefully read your instructions contained in this communication and I
                        fully appreciate the soundness of the principles laid down, as well as the
                        necessity of a strict observance, on my part, of those principles. I have
                        not failed to comprehend the true relations of Nicaragua toward the Mosquito
                        Indian Reserve and the relations existing between the United States and
                        Nicaragua on the one hand and the Mosquito Reserve on the other.</p>
                    <p>What I sought to do was to allay strife and bitterness and misunderstandings
                        where such existed. On my arrival at Bluefields, about April 26, I found the
                        conditions about as bad as they could be. Neither the Nicaraguan authorities
                        nor the foreign citizens were wholly to blame, but a condition bordering on
                        anarchy existed. Ignorant men, without discipline, armed with muskets,
                        promenaded the streets day and night, often in a frenzied manner, provoking
                        frequent disturbances. Some of these “soldiers” were criminals released from
                        the prisons, which latter were thrown wide open on the night of the
                        “occupation.” The mere presence of this armed rabble upon the streets was
                        provocative of breaches of the peace.</p>
                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>I deemed it my duty, in the exercise of a wise discretion as to the best mode
                        of securing protection to American citizens residing in Blue-fields, to
                        attempt to secure the removal of the firebrand from their midst. In doing so
                        there was no denial of the sovereign rights of Nicaragua, directly or by
                        implication. Mr. Madriz seemed to be in full sympathy with the views I
                        expressed as to matters of policy, and readily agreed to the wisdom of
                        removing all causes of irritation possible. His promise to remove the
                        soldiers from Bluefields was voluntarily and cheerfully made.</p>
                    <p>My object in inclosing to you the note of Mr. Charles Lobner, as I did <pb
                            n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0124"/>in my No. 282, was for the purpose
                        of giving you another illustration of the contempt in which Gen. G. A.
                        Lacayo, the commissioner, held the orders of his superior officer, Mr.
                        Madriz.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report
                            herewith an unexpected and radical change in the situation since my last
                            official note to you. On Thursday, the 5th instant, a number of
                            employees of the provisional council, composed chiefly of Jamaicans, who
                            had been acting as policemen, presented their claims at the headquarters
                            of General Cabezas, demanding their pay for services previously
                            rendered. The provisional treasurer, one Aubert, endeavored to put off
                            matters, and this incensed the Jamaicans. This led to an angry
                            altercation between the officials and the Jamaicans, the latter claiming
                            that they were badly treated in not being promptly paid for their
                            services. They were finally paid off, however, but not until after a
                            squad of the Nicaraguan soldiers had attacked them and several of the
                            Jamaicans had been beaten with guns and wounded by the bayonets.</p>
                        <p>After this episode all the police force resigned and all the officials of
                            the provisional government except Aubert and Mongrio (the judge).</p>
                        <p>Three of the Jamaicans were sent to jail by order of General Cabezas, and
                            the order was executed by the soldiers.</p>
                        <p>At once excited groups appeared all along the principal street, and this
                            continued until night.</p>
                        <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0125"/>
                        <p>At about 9 p.m. a large crowd surrounded the new Government buildings and
                            opened a heavy lire on it. The attacking party was composed of natives
                            and Jamaicans.</p>
                        <p>The firing was kept up at intervals until after midnight—the Nicaraguan
                            soldiers returning the fire from the buildings.</p>
                        <p>After about 1 o’clock the firing ceased and all was apparently quiet
                            except one occasional shot, which gave assurance that the excited crowds
                            were still scattered along the street, where they remained until
                            daylight. On the morning of the 6th instant a bulletin was issued and
                            posted on the streets, signed by Robert Henry Clarence, declaring that
                            he had reassumed his rightful authority as hereditary chief of Mosquito
                            and calling on all persons to recognize his said authority in the
                            Mosquito Reserve.</p>
                        <p>The excitement continued, and late in the evening a formal demand was
                            made upon Cabezas to surrender. He asked until morning to consider the
                            terms proposed, and it was finally granted to him.</p>
                        <p>The same evening a small party sailed out to the bluff, and after killing
                            two of the Nicaraguan soldiers and wounding a third, they captured six
                            or seven prisoners, one Krupp gun, and about three hundred rifles, all
                            of which were brought to Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>On the morning of the 7th instant Captain Commander O’Neil was on shore.
                            Cabezas sent for him, and after a few hours Cabezas was permitted to
                            send his 35 soldiers and the prisoners away to Rama, and Cabezas himself
                            was permitted to remain as the Nicaraguan commissioner to the
                            reserve.</p>
                        <p>The Krupp gun and rifles were to be turned over to Captain O’Neil. All
                            the public records and archives were to be turned over to the Mosquito
                            delegation, and Cabezas was to issue an order to Nicaraguan officials
                            along the coast to vacate and turn over to the Mosquitos.</p>
                        <p>On the night of the 5th, when it was known that an attack on the
                            buildings of Cabezas had been planned, I signaled the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Marblehead</hi> with rockets and sent off a boat with a dispatch to
                            Captain O’Neil, accompanied by a petition from the American residents,
                            asking that a force be placed on shore for the protection of life and
                            property.</p>
                        <p>The dispatch did not reach the <hi rend="italic">Marblehead</hi> until
                            about 1 o’clock in the morning, and owing to the roughness of the bar
                            the marines did not reach Bluefields until on the 6th, about 1 p.m.</p>
                        <p>Sixty of them came on shore and are now bivouacking at the courthouse
                            under command of Lieutenant Bowman.</p>
                        <p>A magistrate was appointed and a police force of some thirty men was
                            organized, which is now the civil authority of the reserve.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Marblehead</hi> sailed to Port Limon to forward
                            dispatches on the night of the 7th, and returned this morning.</p>
                        <p>Much excitement continues and rumors are numerous on the streets, the
                            last to the effect that the Nicaraguans at Rama are organizing a force
                            of 500 men and that they are coming down to wipe out
                            everything—Americans and negroes, and men and women and children alike.
                            I am satisfied that only the presence of the American man-of-war will
                            prevent them from making an attack, and that if they should be
                            successful in such attack it would be disastrous to natives and
                            foreigners alike. Of course they are now claiming that the Americans
                            were connected with the assault, as I learned to-day. But if there were
                            any of them so connected with this movement it was only two or three
                            irresponsible parties, who are entirely unknown. I don’t believe any of
                            them had anything to do with it, but that it was an impromptu uprising
                                <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0126"/>of the natives and Jamaica
                            negroes. If they should make an attack now it will be quite different
                            from what it was when Lacayo came here a few months ago.</p>
                        <p>Yours, respectfully,</p>

                        <p>For several weeks there has been a general growling among the employees
                            of the provisional government for payment of salaries due them.
                            Continued appeals and frequent visits were made at the headquarters for
                            settlement, but alas! the same old cry, “There is no money in the
                            chest.” On Saturday last, when it was seen that four large bags
                            containing about $1,200 were conveyed thither, employees cherished a
                            hope of being paid. Fortunately a few provisional ones were, but the
                            unfortunate policemen were not.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday, 5th instant, at 3.30 p.m., about ten police and other
                            employees (laborers) visited the treasurer in order to be paid. They
                            were kept in suspense for a long while and became exasperated and talked
                            loudly. They were threatened to be put out, but afterwards called by
                            General Cabezas, but so soon as they followed him inside in another
                            apartment they were met by a guard of Nicaraguan sentinels, under arms,
                            who charged bayonets on them and further demanding silence. The men,
                            realizing their position, tried to resist this piece of austerity, which
                            resulted in a collision between staffs, bayouets, and gun butts. Of the
                            several blows inflicted both ways, one police sustained loss of some
                            blood, having received a cut on the forehead from a bayonet. Command
                            from a superior authority terminated the conflict and the police were
                            paid forthwith, except three, who were confined. Those that were paid
                            demanded release of the others, but were put out with threats and at the
                            point of the sword, which threats meant that soldiers from the bluff
                            would come in to keep them (the negritos) low as they were boisterous.
                            Matters remained quiet for a while, but the inhabitants were in a fever
                            of excitement when the bugle was sounded at the quartel at about 8.30
                            p.m. Rifle shots passed through many houses in various directions from
                            10 p.m. until almost daylight, causing alarm and great fear to the
                            general public.</p>
                        <p>Luckily only one man was hurt from a bullet. The cuartel and the houses
                            opposite, from the effects of the shattered boarding and broken glass
                            windows, apparently seem to be the spot of the conflict in which
                            civilians and soldiers fought to a finish. At daybreak the flags of both
                            Mosquito and Nicaragua were discovered to be missing off the flag pole,
                            and all prisoners released. Signs for assistance were appealed to from
                            the American warship <hi rend="italic">Marblehead</hi> lying off the
                            bluff, but she failed to comply, as the bar was rough at that hour.</p>
                        <p>Had the greater part of the male population not been on their plantations
                                <pb n="120" xml:id="pg_120" facs="0127"/>the result might have been
                            very disastrous, as such a raid would not be permitted.</p>
                        <p>The citizens are determined not to allow any more of dogged intrigues to
                            be played on them. It is the general opinion that if General Cabezas had
                            not sent away the money, and if Treasurer Aubert had paid the men
                            previously, this occurrence would not be likely to occur, but report
                            says that the Nicaraguans intend to lay the “niggers” low, consequently
                            an uprising is imminent at any moment, as soldiers are expected to
                            arrive from Rama. But the civilians are on the qui vive.</p>
                        <p>Nicaragua fails to govern American marines and blue jackets landed.
                            Provisional council members resign. Natives, now is your time to form a
                            new council and protect yourselves. Delay is dangerous.</p>
                        <p>Mosquito flag floated again predominant at 12.30.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since your dispatch of May 30, 1894, was
                        answered by my instruction of the 13th ultimo, I have received yours of June
                        9, in further relation to your allegation that an “agreement” between
                        yourself and Senor Madriz for the evacuation of Bluefields by Nicaraguan
                        troops had been violated by Commissioner Lacayo.</p>
                    <p>Señor Madriz’s, note of June 2, as transmitted by you in translation, appears
                        to recognize the “personal agreement” of May 5 and admits its violation.</p>
                    <p>Owing to an inaccuracy in translating the third paragraph of Senor Madriz’s
                        note, you seem to have misapprehended the import of his reply. That sentence
                        should read:</p>
                    <p>“Certainly if, departing from what my instructions contemplated, Senor Lacayo
                        has again brought soldiers to Bluefields, he has not fulfilled the orders
                        which I commuuicated to him, and must answer to the Government for his acts.
                        A full report on the subject has consequently been asked for.”</p>
                    <p>This seems to make the issue wholly between the Nicaraguan Government and its
                        agent, and this view is strengthened by the remainder of the minister’s uote
                        to you, which it is observed you have omitted to send here.</p>
                    <p>In a recent conference with Dr. Guzman, he had occasion to show me copies of
                        correspondence lately exchanged between you and Senor Madriz. On reading
                        Senor Madriz’s note to you of June 2, Iremarked that instead of terminating
                        with the passage above quoted it went on to narrate in detail the
                        circumstances under which Senor Madriz had deemed it advisable to station
                        the troops at the bluff, and controverts the supposed agreement to which you
                        appealed. His Excellency explicitly says that “the Government of Nicaragua
                        could not permit its right to be questioned to occupy that region (the
                        Mosquito Reservation) with its troops whenever, in its judgment, such a
                        thing was desirable in order to guarantee the internal or external safety of
                        the State.”</p>
                    <p>Dr. Guzman having kindly furnished me with a full copy of the paper in
                        question, I send you a transcript thereof. The translation is the
                        minister’s.</p>
                    <p>It is proper to advert to the necessity of the Department being fully and
                        accurately advised, without delay, of all correspondence of this nature, in
                        order that it may intelligently consider the facts with full knowledge of
                        all the details, and I shall be pleased to have your explanation of the
                        important omission to which I have referred.</p>

                        <p>I have had the honor to receive your excellency’s polite communication of
                            the 29th ultimo, whereby you were pleased to call my attention to a
                            letter which had been addressed to the legation under your worthy charge
                            by an American citizen of Bluefields, and which had reference to the
                            arrival of an armed force in said city, and to the continuation of the
                            military toques (drum calls?) therein, which had been suspended in
                            pursuance of an order issued by me in my capacity as commissioner of the
                            supreme Government.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency says that this is contrary to the agreement which we
                            personally concluded on the 5th of May, and you refer to the act of the
                            commissioner as an act of decided bad faith.</p>
                        <p>Certainly if, departing from what my instructions contemplated, Mr.
                            Lacayo has again brought soldiers to Bluefields, he has not fulfilled
                            the orders which I communicated to him, and must answer to the
                            Government for his acts. A full report on the subject has consequently
                            been asked for.</p>
                        <p>Let me be permitted to make a brief statement with regard to the
                            circumstances which led to the removal of the Nicaraguan soldiers to the
                            bluff, in pursuance of my order.</p>
                        <p>Before the arrival of the force I told Captain Clarke, of the British
                            ship <hi rend="italic">Magicienne</hi>, that the said force, in case it
                            should arrive as was announced, would be stationed where the Government
                            should order it to be stationed, either at the bluff, at Bluefields, or
                            at some other place on the reservation or on the coast, because the
                            Government of Nicaragua could not permit its right to be questioned to
                            occupy that region with its troops whenever, in its judgment, such a
                            thing was desirable in order to guarantee the internal or external
                            safety of the State; that, however, if that force did not come for the
                            purpose of being stationed, at any particular point, I would order it to
                            remain at the bluff, where it would give less cause of disquiet to the
                            inhabitants of Bluefields, in whose tranquility I was interested.
                            Captain Clarke politely told me that he did not dispute Nicaragua’s
                            right to occupy the region with troops, but that he merely confined
                            himself to recommending that I should adhere to my determination to keep
                            the force at-the bluff.</p>
                        <p>A few days afterwards I received a call at my office from Captain Watson,
                            in command of the North American vessel <hi rend="italic">San
                                Francisco</hi>, and as, in the talk that we had, my conversation
                            with Captain Clarke was referred to, I repeated to Captain Watson the
                            same words that I had used before, and received from him an expression
                            of about the same opinion that I had received from the other.</p>
                        <p>On the day on which I had the honor to accompany your excellency on your
                            journey to Rama, we conversed in a private and friendly way concerning
                            the soldiers who were at the comisaría, you remarking that the residents
                            complained of the military toques (drum calls?), to which they were not
                            accustomed. I stated to your excellency in reply that those troops were
                            at the comisaria because the commanding general had so ordered, but
                            that, as soon as I should receive a reply to a telegram which I had sent
                            to Managua in relation to the matter, I would order the removal of the
                            troops to the bluff.</p>
                        <p>I then understood, as I now understand, that your excellency’s
                            observation <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0130"/>was a purely
                            friendly one and, as I considered your advice as being well founded, I
                            had no hesitation in declaring that I was willing to follow it,
                            especially since that had been my intention ever since the coming of the
                            men was announced.</p>
                        <p>Having received such a reply from Managua as I desired, I felt very glad
                            and took great pleasure in informing your excellency, in our interview
                            of the 5th (you being a friend of the Government and my own personal
                            friend), that I had issued orders for the removal of the troops from
                            Bluefields. The measure had already been adopted 5 my notification was
                            given subsequently to the order. Your excellency politely signified your
                            gratification.</p>
                        <p>The foregoing statement has been made on account of my desire that your
                            excellency should not regard the act of Commissioner Lacayo (if anything
                            wrong has really been done by him) as anything more than an act of
                            disobedience for which he will be required to answer, and not as the
                            violation of an engagement, for, apart from what I have stated, he had
                            no knowledge whatever of what was said in our farewell conversation. He
                            received an order from me without any explanation.</p>
                        <p>The order to remove the troops to the bluff has been reiterated to him,
                            because the Government thought proper that this should be done; and with
                            regard to his past action he has been directed to make a report.</p>
                        <p>Special instructions have been sent him, moreover, touching the course
                            which lie is to pursue in future.</p>
                        <p>With the highest respect and consideration, etc.,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Government here gave out word some days
                        ago that “an insurrection of the negroes at Bluefields had broken out under
                        the leadership of a Hollander named Renling, and participated in by American
                        citizens,” and announced the purpose of sending at once 1,000 men and 4
                        cannon to put down the uprising.</p>
                    <p>When questioned by me, the President and his minister for foreign affairs
                        informed me that the news of this affair had been telegraphed to them from
                        Port Limon, Costa Rica; that they were in possession of no further
                        particulars; that the telegraph line between Managua and Grey Town was down;
                        and that there was no way in which anything like speedy communication could
                        be had between this place and Blue-fields. You may not be aware of this
                        unpleasant truth, that neither telegrams nor letters are conveyed by this
                        Government on such occasions unless entirely agreeable to them. In this case
                        the President frankly informed me that communication with Bluefields was
                        suspended.</p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Minister</hi>: In a telegram dated at Port Limon
                            the Government is informed by the inspector-general of the Atlantic
                            Coast that an insurrection of the negroes at Bluefields has just broken
                            out, under the leadership of a Hollander, Reuling, and participated in
                            by American citizens.</p>
                        <p>The inspector and the small force who were on duty have been compelled to
                            evacuate the reserve after having witnessed the death of two of their
                            number and the wounding and capture of others.</p>
                        <p>Confronted by such an attack the Government deems it expedient to take
                            energetic steps toward the recovery of their national rights and the
                            punishment of the authors of such a criminal act. It is very painful to
                            it to learn that there are American citizens implicated in the uprising,
                            because against its wish it will have to apply the penalties of the laws
                            of war to them.</p>
                        <p>If your excellency can bring any influence to bear which may prevent the
                            further participation of your countrymen you will be doing an act of
                            humanity and free the Government from the painful necessity of severely
                            punishing people whom it wishes to bring back to obedience and
                            legitimate neutrality by peaceful and gentle means.</p>
                        <p>I hope your excellency will be good enough to inform me by telegraph at
                            Leon, to which place the Government is going to-day, of the measures you
                            may take for effectually preventing the intervention of the Americans in
                            the rebellion in the reserve.</p>

                        <p>For the protection of American interests another man-of-war required.
                            Affairs are very disturbed at Bluefields. There are no prospects of a
                            settlement. The situation is alarming. It is feared that hostilities can

                            American interests at Bluefields. The only means of telegraphing is from

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In addition to my dispatch of yesterday I have
                        to report that Mr. H. F. Bingham called on me this morning, announcing to me
                        his promotion as secretary of the legation and near departure for San Jose,
                        Costa Rica. * * *</p>
                    <p>I learned: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>That the admiral, on his suggestion, had ordered the gunboat <hi
                                    rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> to reinforce at Bluefields (she
                                carries six guns and can enter the lagoon).</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>That he had reports that the negroes at Corn Island had revolted,
                                shooting down a few Nicaraguans, throwing down the flag of this
                                Republic, and finally burning the house of the governor. I admitted
                                to have heard so too, and even that the British flag had been
                                hoisted, and that I think that this will raise an uproar in the
                                United States; that I would like to make known as soon as possible
                                to the United States Government what the standpoint of Her Britannic
                                Majesty’s officials would be in regard to such outrages and
                                revolution.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>Mr. Bingham said that he could not believe in the hoisting of the British
                        flag for the reason that there are people at Corn Island who ought to know
                        better, to know that Corn Island belongs to Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>The governor of this port grows every day more arbitrary, forcing foreigners
                        into his military troop, which he compels to stay every night in the
                        Government’s buildings. Having no cipher code, I requested Mr. Bingham, who
                        called on me in this same affair last night, to forward a cipher telegram to
                        the Hon. L. Baker, through the British consul at Granada in my name, asking
                        for instructions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderson, an Englishman, owner of a rich plantation on the Nicaraguan
                        side of the San Juan River, bought a house, lumber, provisions, etc., in the
                        United States and shipped everything to this free port, expecting to enter
                        these goods free of duty according to the reciprocity treaty. Governor Rivas
                        now forces him to pay 12 to 13 per cent duty for the Grey Town tax, he being
                        10 miles far from town. The feeling among the natives is almost more
                        intensive than that of the foreigners against this local government, and
                        everybody is convinced that this provoking attitude must lead, or even seems
                        to be intended to lead, to trouble, and therefore I considered it my duty to
                        report the danger of the situation.</p>

                        <p>The situation at Bluefields on July 10 is that the Mosquitos have full
                            charge of the government of this part of the reservation. The Nicaraguan
                            soldiers here all sent away to Rama under pressure on the 7th. Our men
                            still on shore, as people are alarmed and the native element have not

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your
                        dispatch of the 28th of May, in which you report a recent interview with
                        Lord Kimberley touching the Bluefields incident, and communicate the desire
                            <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0134"/>expressed on behalf of Her
                        Majesty’s Government to act in accord with the United States, and in
                        deference to oar judgment in dealing with the question.</p>
                    <p>It gives me pleasure to commend the views which you so clearly expressed to
                        Lord Kimberley.</p>
                    <p>During your incumbency of this office, in an instruction to Mr. Phelps, our
                        minister at London (No. 999, of November 23, 1888), you called attention to
                        the fact that as long ago as 1853 Lord John Russell pointed out to Mr.
                        Crampton that “the Mosquito Indians, instead of governing their own tribe
                        according to their own customs, <hi rend="italic">furnish a name and
                            title</hi> to Europeans and Americans who carry on trade at Grey Town
                        and along the coast of Mosquito <hi rend="italic">according to the usages of
                            civilized nations.”</hi> This control of the affairs of that region by
                        alien residents continued until the treaty of Managua was concluded in 1860,
                        one of the obvious purposes of which was the correction of this abuse and
                        the removal of all pretext for the intervention of any foreign protector or
                        interested power. The condition described by Lord John Russell as
                        notoriously existing in 1853 most certainly exists to-day. Indian government
                        within the meaning of the treaty in this part of the territory of Nicaragua,
                        has never existed, and owing to the incapacity of the Indians it may be
                        safely said never will exist. Great Britain, by her solemn renunciation of a
                        protectorate of any kind over the Indians, was of course barred from
                        intervening to establish or advise an Indian government; and it may be well
                        here to remark that when it was concluded in 1860, the treaty of Managua was
                        regarded by the United States as a satisfactory settlement of-the Central
                        American policy or question, simply and solely because it was believed to
                        terminate, once for all, the British claim to protect the Indians. With the
                        details of the relations between them and the expressly recognized
                        territorial sovereign the United States had no concern.</p>
                    <p>My instruction to you of April 30, No. 374, will have shown that the late
                        attempts to organize, through alien intervention, a government for the
                        Mosquito Reservation wholly foreign to the scheme provided by the treaty of
                        Managua, were deemed by us to be at variance with the policy and engagements
                        of half a century. Acceptance of the implied invitation of Lord Kimberley
                        for the United States to join with Great Britain in devising a solution of
                        the problems growing out of the Bluefields incident might imply a
                        willingness on the part of this Administration to depart from the consistent
                        policy pursued by previous administrations in dealing with Central American
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>The situation at Bluefields and elsewhere in the strip presents no question
                        difficult of solution. The sovereignty of Nicaragua over the whole of the
                        national domain is unquestionable. She has granted or secured to certain
                        Indians within part of her domain the right of self-government, under
                        expressed conditions and limitations. It may be safely said that such
                        government does not exist and has not existed in the Mosquito territory. An
                        alien administration, in other interests than those of the Indians,
                        notoriously exists, especially at Bluefields. Nobody is deceived by calling
                        this authority a Mosquito Indian government. No matter how conspicuous the
                        American or other alien interests which have grown up under the fiction of
                        Indian self-government, neither the United States nor Great Britain can
                        fairly sanction or uphold this colorable abuse of the sovereignty of
                        Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>So far as American rights of person and property in the reservation are
                        concerned, this Government can not distinguish them from like rights in any
                        other part of Nicaragua; and should they be invaded <pb n="128"
                            xml:id="pg_128" facs="0135"/>we could only look to the territorial
                        sovereign for redress. This being so, the United States could neither
                        participate in nor sanction any device whereby the ultimate authority and
                        international responsibility of Nicaragua in respect of American citizens in
                        the reservation might be impaired or restricted.</p>
                    <p>These general considerations are submitted for your guidance in dealing with
                        any suggestions Lord Kimberley may advance.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Since my instruction to you of the 19th
                        instant, in relation to affairs in the Mosquito Reservation, was written, a
                        change in the situation has been abruptly brought about by a hostile
                        movement against the Nicaraguan authority, participated in, I fear, by
                        Americans.</p>
                    <p>Details have not yet been received, but from the telegraphic reports of our
                        minister in Nicaragua and the commander of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Marble-head</hi>, it would appear that the uprising resulted in the
                        ousting of the Nicaraguan garrison at Bluefields, the seizure of the bluff
                        by the attacking forces, and the restoration of the chief, Clarence.</p>
                    <p>It is gratifying to learn that the presence of marines landed from our war
                        vessel prevented further acts of violence and I am informed by Minister
                        Baker that he has advised the American residents of Blue-fields touching
                        their duty toward the sovereign Government. It is hoped that these timely
                        precautions will contribute to the maintenance of tranquillity and prevent
                        unlawful interference of citizens of the United States in a matter which
                        only concerns the Nicaraguan Government and the Indians dwelling in its
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The only limitation imposed by the treaty of Managua upon the sovereignty of
                        Nicaragua over the Mosquito territory was the right of the Mosquito Indians
                        to govern themselves and others inhabiting that country according to Indian
                        usage and custom. The sovereignty of the Government with that exception is
                        as complete over the strip as over any other portion of its territory, and
                        if the Indians themselves do not, or <pb n="129" xml:id="pg_129" facs="0136"
                        />can not exercise that right or privilege, it can not be exercised by
                        aliens in their name. While this Government will protect all the legitimate
                        rights of Americans sojourning or transacting business in the reservation,
                        it can not support them in an effort to establish and maintain an
                        essentially alien municipal government.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report
                            herewith that on Saturday, the 14th instant, there were presented at
                            this office several written protests against the seizure and detention
                            of certain steam tugs, boats, and barges, the property of American
                            residents, by order of Gen. Rigoberto Cabezas, as commissioner, etc., at
                            Rama,</p>
                        <p>The said protests were made by Mr. Thomas Waters, agent of the Blueflelds
                            Banana Company, Mr. A. B. Orr, representing the firm of Orr &amp;
                            Laubenheimer, and Mr. Burke, tally agent for Messrs. Brown &amp; Harris,
                            Copies of the said protests are herewith inclosed.</p>
                        <p>Authenticated copies of the said protests were immediately forwarded to
                            Captain O’Neil, commander of the U. S. war ship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Marblehead</hi>, and also to Lieutenant Bowman, commanding
                            detachment of United States marines at Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday, the 15th instant, the fruit steamer <hi rend="italic"
                                >Hispania</hi> steamed up the Rio Escondido, having in tow the steam
                            launch of the <hi rend="italic">Marble-head</hi>, with Captain O’Neil
                            himself on board, and boat’s crew (marines) and one Gatling gun.</p>
                        <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hispania</hi>, with the said launch in tow, arrived
                            at the wharf at Rama about 6 o’clock p.m.</p>
                        <p>Captain O’Neil went on shore, and after a brief interview with General
                            Cabezas, the steam tugs, barges, etc., were released. Captain O’Neil
                            remained in Rama during the night and returned to Bluefields this
                            evening.</p>
                        <p>The steam tugs also came down from Rama, five of them. The river steamer
                                <hi rend="italic">Hurdy</hi> is also here, tied up at the wharf, and
                            will probably make no more trips up the river until an adjustment of the
                            troubles is effected.</p>
                        <p>The steamship <hi rend="italic">Nicaragua</hi> went up the river this
                            morning, the 18th, but will not go to. Rama, and will get her cargo from
                            the lower river.</p>
                        <p>The commerce of the place has been so disastrously affected that the
                            fruit on most of the plantations is rotting, and the laborers refuse to
                            take employment on the upper river and its tributaries, claiming that
                            they are afraid of violence at the hands of the Nicaraguans.</p>
                        <p>Very little communication is now maintained between the town of
                            Bluefields and Rama. Nearly all American families on the river have come
                            down to Bluefields in order to avail themselves of the protection
                            afforded by the presence of the American marines now on shore at
                            Bluefields. The town is patrolled at night by a strong police guard,
                            supplied by the local authorities—that is, Clarence and his crowd.</p>
                        <p>The foreign residents also keep out a watch for their own protection, in
                            order not to be taken by surprise.</p>
                        <p>July 19.—Mr. A. B. Orr has just arrived from Rama and reports all quiet
                            and no apparent movement indicating an attack on Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>Yours, sincerely,</p>

                        <p>The members of the provisional council being congregated by order of its
                            president for to deliberate on the events that occurred from the 5th to
                            the 8th of July, it is manifest that having absolute occupation, imposed
                            by the circumstances we nominate to restore them Mr. D. H. Thomas, who
                            was called immediately to take possession of his place, and there under
                            his presidency was opened for discussion, having in sight the
                            proclamation of Mr. Robert Henry Clarence, in which he reassumes the
                            command of the Mosquito Reserve, from which he was despoiled by the
                            Supreme Government, and by an expressed consent, celebrated between the
                            commissioner and Her Britannic Majesty’s consul.</p>
                        <p>This act, outside of being flagrant usurpation of authority, is illegal,
                            because various crimes center thereon:</p>
                        <p>That of lese sovereignty, because the multitudes ran through the streets,
                            grasping rifles, and keeping up a continual fire on the palace of the
                            Nicaraguan Government, which lasted from 9 p.m. until 4 a.m. of the 6th
                            instant; the discharges and mutinous clamor and outcry disturbed
                            profoundly the order, and they imposed by their violence a dangerous
                            uneasiness to all the peaceable citizens in the city.</p>
                        <p>That of disrespect to the sovereignty, intimidating the representative of
                            the Republic and military chief of the coast, causing him to yield.</p>
                        <p>That of assassination, committed on the soldiers of the Republic who were
                            in charge of a piece of artillery on the bluff, and who, taken by
                            surprise, were killed.</p>
                        <p>The basis of the usurper government rests in blood, and this Government,
                            viewing all the detestable characters of the crime of high treason, in
                            virtue thereof, all their acts are void of effect, and considering that
                            it is necessary to provide measures of repression until the Supreme
                            Government resolves that suitable, the legitimate constituted

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: My latest information from Bluefields by mail
                        is of the date of July 7. I have nothing direct by wire. You are probably
                        aware that there is no telegraph line from here to Bluefields; or, for that
                        matter none to Bluefields from any quarter. It happens that three or four
                        weeks sometimes pass without any mail from Bluefields to Grey Town, and from
                        Grey Town to this city the wire is on rotten poles; it runs for <pb n="133"
                            xml:id="pg_133" facs="0140"/>many miles through a forest so dense as to
                        defy the rays of the sun, and is usually “down” when anyone else than the
                        Government desires its use.</p>
                    <p>Consul Braida makes most serious complaint of his inability to telegraph to
                        me, as well as the interference with his mails between Blue-fields and Grey
                        Town.</p>
                    <p>Minister Madriz leaves here to-day for Bluefields, as special commissioner,
                        and through his courtesy I send letters to Consul Braida, Commander O’Neil
                        of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Marblehead</hi>, and Consular Agent B. B.
                        Seat, esq.</p>
                    <p>I herewith inclose a copy of the latter, and they were all of similar
                        tenor.</p>
                    <p>I had a talk with Mr. Madriz this morning, and I find his mind filled with
                        the idea that the Americans are at the bottom of the trouble at Bluefields,
                        and his assistant secretary, Roman Mayorga Rivas, esq., more frank than
                        discreet, announced the purpose of the Government to “take down 1,000 troops
                        and 4 cannon and butcher all the Americans in that territory, if necessary
                        to establish and maintain Nicaraguan rule there.”</p>
                    <p>It has been developed that 1,300 to 1,500 soldiers will go down from here,
                        many have already gone, and the army of Honduras has been drawn upon
                        besides. Great efforts have been made to create enthusiasm among the
                        soldiers who are going to the front. This morning’s “El 93,” contains an
                        address from the President to the army, and an editorial, both intended to
                        contribute to the above purpose. I send you inclosed a copy of the paper. As
                        the mail is just closing for Corinto, I will not have time to make the
                        translations.</p>
                    <p>I have had a little backset in my sickness, and have been in bed again this
                        week. This has been the sickliest season known in Nicaragua for many years.
                        About 20 per cent of the foreigners in this vicinity, I am informed, have
                        died. The fever has been a malignant one, with many of the characteristics
                        of the yellow fever. It seems to have been brought here from Panama. Whether
                        the President shall fill this consulate, which has now been vacant over a
                        year, or not, I will be compelled to get away from here either temporarily
                        or permanently. I must have a change to live, or a change will come to me in
                        death.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I thank you for your report of the mob by
                            the negro and Indian residents of Bluefields on the night of July 5,
                            arising out of the repeated refusal of the Nicaraguan authorities to pay
                            the policemen in their employ.</p>
                        <p>I most sincerely regret this occurrence, but I am gratified to be
                            assured, as I am by you, that no American has been mixed up in this
                            disgracefnl affair.</p>
                        <p>His Honor Minister Madriz is returning to Bluefields as special
                            commissioner of the Government of Nicaragua, and he has kindly consented
                            to bring this to you. Before giving it to him I permitted him to know
                                <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0141"/>the contents of your report
                            to me; I also presented to him and to the President the complaints of
                            the Rama parties. At the time Mr. Madriz was down last April and May, I
                            understood that he had given orders that ships should be permitted to
                            load and unload fruit during all hours, day and night, as is done in all
                            towns and cities of the United States, and I feel quite sure that the
                            act of which you complain will meet his prompt disapproval.</p>
                        <p>Minister Madriz was at Bluefields at the time of my visit in April and
                            May, and I found him to be conservative, clear in his ideas, and
                            disposed to be just. Upon his careful report of the condition of public
                            sentiment down there, the President responded promptly to such
                            reasonable requests as I thought it proper to make of him for the
                            protection of American interests in the reserve.</p>
                        <p>For this reason alone, even though there was no other, it is a source of
                            keen regret to me that this unholy mob broke out.</p>
                        <p>The Government of the United States concedes, as you know, the
                            sovereignty of Nicaragua over the Mosquito Territory. Only England has
                            any treaty which limits the full and free action of Nicaragua over
                            Mosquitia. As Americans we concede to Nicaragua all the powers of a
                            sovereign; and our position is that of guests in the house of a
                            neighbor. We came into this house and we acquired certain rights of
                            property, and went into business on certain conditions and under certain
                            guarantees. Our business, as I said, is to act in good faith as guests,
                            as neutrals; their business is to protect us in all our rights. And I
                            feel reasonably certain that if we remain true to our proper position,
                            the Nicaraguan Government will finally adjust in an equitable manner all
                            our just claims.</p>
                        <p>It is pleasing to me to learn, as I do through others, that during the
                            recent troubles in Bluefields you discouraged every species of disorder
                            and threw your influence on the side of peace and order. I can not too
                            highly commend all Americans who took the same conservative and proper
                            course.</p>

                        <p>We take pleasure in inserting the proclamation which has been addressed
                            by the General President to the expeditionary army that is about to go
                            to Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>It is as follows:</p>
                        <p rend="flushleft"><hi rend="italic">Soldiers of the expeditionary force of
                                the Atlantic Coast:</hi></p>
                        <p>Our country again requires your services to uphold its integrity and its
                            sovereign rights. I have summoned you to march to our Atlantic coasts in
                            order there to raise our flag to the height which is demanded by our
                            national dignity.</p>
                        <p>To you, the upholders of our liberty and autonomy, I desire to
                            communicate the reason of this summons.</p>
                        <p>On the 5th of the present month the negroes of Jamaica, having been badly
                            advised by certain adventurers who desired to secure control of the
                            wealth of those coasts, raised the cry of insurrection against the
                            authorities of Nicaragua, taking advantage of a time when a few of your
                            companions remained upholding order and giving them guarrautees. The
                            efforts of these Nicaraguan soldiers who had to do battle <pb n="135"
                                xml:id="pg_135" facs="0142"/>against a large number of those negroes
                            were fruitless, some of them dying heroically in defending the dignity
                            and honor of Nicaragua. It is for you to continue the work which those
                            martyrs were unable to finish owing to their scanty numbers.</p>
                        <p>You have shown in the recent Honduran campaign how much you love your
                            country, and how you punish the folly of those who dare to cast
                            discredit upon our flag. It is just one year since you liberated all
                            Nicaragua in the bloody battle of La Ouesta. I invoke those souvenirs
                            which do you so much honor, and ask you to make known this time, with
                            the same bravery and heroism, in the remote region of the Atlantic, what
                            the Nicaraguan soldier can do when he fights for the honor of his
                            country.</p>
                        <p>You will be led to those coasts by the experienced and valiant Generals
                            Reyes, Balladases, Bone, and Uriarte. You know them well. With their
                            skill and your valor victory is certain.</p>
                        <p>I urge you to observe the good behavior and the discipline of which you
                            have given so many evidences.</p>
                        <p>You are going to a region where it is sought to make us appear as savages
                            who do not know how to govern. I charge you to show by your honorable
                            conduct and excellent demeanor how infamous is the slander which those
                            negroes have concocted against us.</p>
                        <p>Before taking leave of you, I desire especially to commend to you the
                            brave minister, Dr. José Madriz, who is to accompany you on this
                            expedition. He goes in the name of the Government to impose our laws
                            upon the rebels. He feels confidence in the success of his mission,
                            because he relies upon soldiers who, like you, will execute his orders
                            at the proper time.</p>
                        <p>I feel confident that I shall see you on your return crowned with
                            laurels, and I know that if you are not sufficent to punish those
                            insurgents, our entire army will go, with your commander in chief and
                            friend at its head.</p>

                        <p>Prior to February last they had lived quietly and prosperously under the
                            Mosquito régime until it was overthrown by the Nicaraguans, who have in
                            fact governed it since then, though there has been a mixed council known
                            as “The Provisional Council,” who were supposed to exercise the
                            functions of Government, but the original members resigned one after the
                            other, and there being no provision for filling Vacancies the Nicaraguan
                            commissioner, first General Lacayo, and later General Cabezas, acting as
                            such, filled the vacancies and gradually concentrated all authority in
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>No legislative body Existed, and decrees were issued in the name of the
                            provisional council and sometimes in the name of the commissioner,
                            making laws with reference to taxes, land rents, and other matters which
                            were considered as arbitrary and harsh measures.</p>
                        <p>For example, a few weeks ago the inclosed notice was issued relative to
                            the payment in advance of a year’s rent of lands.</p>
                        <p>These and other matters gave great dissatisfaction, and the sympathies
                            and interests of the foreign population were with the Mosquitoes, under
                            whose mild and easy rule they had materially prospered.</p>
                        <p>The inhabitants of the reserve naturally feel that their territory has
                            been invaded by the Nicaraguans, and tell many stories of oppression and
                            injustice, and of course are hostile to the Nicaraguan Government and
                            its officials.</p>
                        <p>The American community here is a very respectable one, made up of
                            representatives of fruit and mahogany companies, of jobbers and
                            importers, clerks, pilots, a doctor, and a few people of other trades
                            and occupations. I do not learn of any disreputable characters among:
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Probably with two or three exceptions they all are in sympathy with the
                            Mosquito party, and I have heard a good deal of indiscreet talk which
                            should not be indulged in, and at the meeting at the United States
                            consulate I called their attention to the impropriety of the matter and
                            counseled them to refrain from even an appearance of being identified
                            with either faction, but I know very well that some Americans are now
                            named for places in the Mosquito council, and some others have taken
                            civil offices under them already.</p>
                        <p>In the event of there being hostilities between the Mosquitoes and
                            Nicaraguans, these people will at least be open to the suspicion of
                            having taken an unfriendly attitude toward the sovereign power, though I
                            do not know that there is in itself any impropriety in taking a purely
                            civil office, such, for instance, as magistrate.</p>
                        <p>As soon as I can get on shore again I propose to again see as many of the
                            American, residents as I can, and shall tell them plainly that if they
                            aid or abet in any measures hostile to the Government of Nicaragua they
                            must not look to me for aid, as I will have nothing to do with them.</p>
                        <p>The so-called British subjects are practically all Jamaica negroes, and
                            of course identified with the Mosquitoes.</p>
                        <p>I have no idea what steps the Mosquitoes propose to take for their
                            preservation. The young chief told me they did not propose to have any
                            more Nicaraguans here; but he is an [in]experienced boy and did not know
                            what he was talking about, nor did he have the faintest idea as to the
                            gravity of the situation. I heard talk about purchasing arms in the
                            United States, but they have no organization and no leaders and could
                            only resort to guerrilla warfare. I have formed the opinion that they
                            would not offer much resistance, but some time ago, when H. M. S. <hi
                                rend="italic">Magicienne</hi> was here, Captain. Clarke said there
                            were a great many arms in the country and the people would fight.</p>
                        <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0144"/>
                        <p>The Americans here are only in danger should there be a general uprising,
                            when, in the excitement, anybody’s property might be injured; there is
                            no hostility to them, but in the absence of a strong and well-organized
                            local government, disorder is likely to occur, especially as, owing to
                            the recent excitement, the natives have many of them quit work.</p>
                        <p>The United States consular agent, Mr. Seat, is very well informed as to
                            local matters, and is an educated and very intelligent man; therefore
                            his reports will probably be much more comprehensive than mine, as he
                            undoubtedly understands the situation and all the causes that led to it
                            better than I do.</p>
                        <p>So far as I can judge at present we ought to be able to furnish necessary
                            protection for Americans with the force now here.</p>
                        <p>I can not think that the Nicaraguan Government will quietly accept the
                            situation nor overlook the attack upon her soldiers.</p>
                        <p>I am told that Bluefields can only be approached by water (from sea or by
                            way of the Escondido River) and if the Mosquitoes had a few guns they
                            could hold out for a long time; but they have none.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report the following
                            occurrences, which have transpired in this vicinity during the past few
                            days:</p>
                        <p>July 4 was observed in the settlement of Bluefields to a less extent than
                            usual by the Americans, because they were depressed and anxious, and
                            feared that should they make any demonstration in the way <pb n="138"
                                xml:id="pg_138" facs="0145"/>of a parade, etc, that some excitement
                            might arise or some pretext be given for a disturbance.</p>
                        <p>Brig. Gen. Rigoberto Cabezas, a Nicaraguan official, holding the position
                            of “inspector-general of the Atlantic Coast,” and who, in the absence of
                            General Lacayo, is acting as “Nicaraguan commissioner” to the Mosquito
                            Reserve, and who, by virtue of the latter office, is “president of the
                            provisional council.” was in fact the governing power of the community,
                            as the provisional council had practically ceased to exist, as all the
                            original members had resigned, and there were no recognized provisions
                            for filling their places.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas issued an announcement to the employees of the
                            Government, proclaiming the 4th a holiday, explaining its significance,
                            and addressed me a friendly and complimentary note, which I
                            acknowledged. The Nicaraguan Government house was properly decorated
                            with flags, and guns were fired at intervals during the day in the
                            headquarters and at the bluff, some 5 miles distant, at the entrance to
                            the lagoon, and where the custom-house is located.</p>
                        <p>I had been on shore on the 3d and 4th for the express purpose of mixing
                            with the people, to learn their views and get as much insight into
                            matters as possible, and everything was apparently quiet when I went off
                            to the vessel on the 4th, but I could get no farther than the bluff on
                            that day and had to stop on board a steamer at anchor and reached the
                            ship on the morning of the 5th.</p>
                        <p>At midnight on the 5th a tug came out and brought me a communication from
                            the United States consular agent (B. E. Seat, esq.) informing me that
                            the presence of some of our men was necessary in view of the unsettled
                            state of affairs (copy herewith, A); this was accompanied by a memorial
                            signed by 25 persons, nearly all Americans, and the acting British
                            vice-consul (copy herewith, B).</p>
                        <p>It being extremely hazardous to attempt to cross the bar at night in
                            ship’s boats, and having had no direct communication with or from the
                            authorities of Nicaragua with regard to landing men, I sent back word to
                            the consular agent that I would send men in at daylight to the bluff,
                            but would not land them until permission had been obtained from the
                            authorities to do so (see copy herewith, C).</p>
                        <p>At early daylight on the morning of the 6th I went into the settlement in
                            the gig, leaving orders for Lieutenant Bowman to follow with a
                            detachment of about 54 marines and bluejackets, with 3 other officers,
                            and for them not to land, but to await further instructions in their
                            boats at the bluff.</p>
                        <p>Upon reaching the settlement I went at once to the consular agent and
                            learned that in the previous evening (after he had sent his letter to
                            me) a mob had opened fire on the (Nicaraguan) Government house with
                            rifles, at about 9 p.m., and that the streets in the vicinity were full
                            of armed men discharging their rifles, which was kept up during the
                            night and until about 4 o’clock the next morning. The Government house
                            was pretty well riddled with bullets, and several houses in the
                            vicinity, of Americans and others, were repeatedly hit, but so far as
                            learned no one was killed, but there was great alarm throughout the
                            community.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas, with some thirty-five Nicaraguan soldiers, occupied the
                            Government house, and he informs me that he restrained his men from
                            firing on the mob, because he feared to injure people in the houses near
                            by.</p>
                        <p>In company with Mr. Seat I called upon General Oabezas to inquire into
                            the situation and asked him if he could and would guarantee the <pb
                                n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0146"/>safety of law-abiding American
                            citizens and their property. He said in effect that while he would like
                            to do so, he feared that under existing circumstances it would not be
                            possible, whereupon I told him I was ready to land men for the purpose
                            and to help preserve order if he would request it, or grant permission
                            for me to do so, and further stated that I would like such request or
                            permission in writing.</p>
                        <p>The General said he would like to have the men landed, and would address
                            me a note to that effect, which be did (see copy herewith, translation
                            D), and requested, or rather proposed, that the men should be quartered
                            there, on the premises of the Nicaraguan Government house, which I told
                            him I could not do, as it would be misunderstood by all the people that
                            we had landed to join forces with the Nicaraguans, and, moreover, it
                            would be putting our own men in the way of immediate conflict with the
                            people, and could not quarter them in the same com-.pound with the
                            Nicaraguan troops. He finally said we could make use of the court-house
                            as barracks, and it proved to be admirably suited to the purpose, on
                            high ground back of the settlement, and where our men have been very
                            comfortable.</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon receiving permission to land, a light-draft steamer,
                            furnished by the agent of the Southern Pacific Company, was sent to the
                            bluff to bring our men up, and at 12.30 p.m. on the 6th instant they
                            disembarked at the settlement, and, followed by an orderly crowd,
                            marched to the court-house.</p>
                        <p>As soon as they landed, General Cabezas suggested that I should clear the
                            streets of some groups of men who were assembled, and one of which had
                            hoisted the Mosquito flag, but I told him that was not my intention. As
                            will be seen from his letter (D), he would like to have me assume the
                            control of the settlement, and was quite disappointed when I told him
                            the substance of my written reply to him (copy herewith, E). Had I done
                            so it would have meant a serious issue with the people and an occupation
                            of an indefinite time until more troops could be obtained by him.</p>
                        <p>The cause of the attack upon the Government house is generally agreed to
                            be due to the action of some of the employees of the acting commissioner
                            in harshly treating some policemen who applied for their pay. Hard words
                            passed and some or all of them were roughly handled and ejected by the
                            soldiers, and it is supposed that after dark they and a lot of their
                            sympathizers banded together and went to take revenge, and as arms are
                            in possession of a large number of the people, the thing became
                            contagious. It is quite sure, however, that the firing on the evening of
                            the 6th, above referred to, was done by a mob, and had no other
                            signification than to show the temper of the people, nor can it be
                            connected with events which followed, except in an indirect manner.</p>
                        <p>After seeing our men properly disposed, I went to the United States
                            consulate and asked the consular agent to get together as soon as
                            practicable as many representative Americans as possible, and in a short
                            time perhaps twenty assembled, accompanied by the British acting
                            vice-consul and a few citizens of other countries. I stated briefly to
                            them the object of our landing and our strictly neutral attitude as
                            regarded the factions, and told them in what way we proposed to protect
                            them, etc., and extended the same to British and any other law-abiding
                            foreign residents, and counseled them to abstain from any participation
                            in or interference with the contention going on.</p>
                        <p>While thus engaged a letter was brought to me which, upon opening, I
                            found to be a proclamation (copy herewith, F) from Robert Henry
                            Clarence, hereditary chief of Mosquito, to the effect that he has <pb
                                n="140" xml:id="pg_140" facs="0147"/>resumed his rightful authority
                            as chief of Mosquito, etc. I could see that there was no little
                            satisfaction among the Americans at this turn of affairs, but I again
                            counseled them to keep out of the political agitation, and to advise
                            others to do the same.</p>
                        <p>After the gathering at the consulate bad dispersed I called on the
                            Mosquito Chief, who was still domiciled at the British consulate, and
                            had a few words with him, but of no special import, and then went again
                            to see General Cabezas, who admitted that the situation was complicated,
                            but he could do little but report matters to his Government.</p>
                        <p>Our men being comparatively few in number could not be posted about the
                            town, nor was it expedient that they should be, as the streets are quite
                            dark at night and they could not support each other or perform useful
                            service in such small groups as we should have to make, so good-sized
                            patrols were paraded at intervals through different sections of the
                            settlement simply to be seen and to give assurance to our people that we
                            were on the alert.</p>
                        <p>As soon as the Mosquito Chief had proclaimed himself he appointed as
                            chief of police an American, a Texan, I believe, by the name of Folks,
                            or something similar, and he looked quite equal to any emergency. A
                            police force was hastily organized and did good service in preserving
                            order. There were no other police, and General Cabezas and his few
                            soldiers were as good as besieged at the Government house, as none of
                            them could venture out with impunity.</p>
                        <p>Late this same afternoon a party of volunteers from the Mosquito faction,
                            or their sympathizers, went down to the bluff in two small boats, with
                            about fifteen armed men, arriving there just before sunset. At the
                            custom-house at the bluff were three Nicaraguan military officers, ten
                            men, and a 7-pound Krupp field gun and about two hundred stand of arms
                            and some ammunition. The party from the settlement surprised them, shot
                            and killed two soldiers, wounded one, captured the officers and arms,
                            and brought them up to the town and planted the gun in the main street,
                            pointing toward the Government house, and I was told then sent word to
                            General Cabezas demanding that he turn over the Government with its
                            archives, etc., and giving him until 8 o’clock the next morning to
                            reply. I can not find out yet whether the attack on the Nicaraguan
                            soldiers was authorized by the Mosquito officials or not, or whether
                            they knew anything about it until after it was accomplished, but by
                            subsequently entering into negotiations as to the disposition of the
                            arms, they practically became a party to the serious charge of
                            perpetrating an act of war against the sovereign State of Nicaragna, and
                            I doubt if they yet realize the gravity of such an act.</p>
                        <p>Everything was quiet in the settlement during the night, with the
                            exception of the murder of a colored woman, who was stabbed and killed
                            in the main street by a colored man, the result of a quarrel, which had
                            no bearing on the situation. The murderer was quickly arrested by
                            Americans and lodged in jail. At 7 o’clock the following morning I went
                            to see General Cabezas. and he explained to me the gravity of his
                            situation; alone in the Government house with his few men, and an angry
                            populace, well armed, against him, with the field gun in their
                            possession, it would be but a few moments’ work to annihilate them and
                            burn the Government building.</p>
                        <p>He asked my advice as to a proper course to pursue under the
                            circumstances. I told him I did not feel competent to advise, as I could
                            not put myself in his place, but thought that in face of an overwhelming
                            force it would be wise to make the best terms he could, and that I had
                            heard a number of people say that if he would simply resume the <pb
                                n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0148"/>duties of acting commissioner,
                            and would withdraw the Nicaraguan soldiers, tranquility would be
                            restored. He then asked me if I would go in his name to the Mosquito
                            chief and make such a proposition, further stipulating that the
                            provisions and arms captured at the bluff should be given up, and that
                            safety should be guaranteed to himself and any Nicaraguan officials.</p>
                        <p>I accordingly went to the chiefs quarters (in British consulate) and told
                            him I had an important communication to make, and requested that he
                            would get in some of his counsellors and the American and British
                            consular officers. He sent out for Mr. Patterson, the vice-president of
                            the Mosquito council, Mr. Cuthbert, the attorney-general (his former
                            guardian), and one or two others, and the American and British consular
                            officers being present, I stated General Cabezas’s terms, and after a
                            good deal of discussion they agreed to all except the delivery of the
                            arms, and stipulated that General Cabezas should at once notify
                            Nicaraguan officials in all towns within his district that Mosquito
                            authorities were in power and were not to be interfered with. I
                            immediately went to see the General and stated the case, but he still
                            stood out for the arms and urged me to use my good offices to secure
                            them, and if no other way was open to receive them myself. I went back
                            again and urged the Mosquito officials not to impede a final settlement,
                            and as this was the only point not agreed upon, said I would receive the
                            arms and take them out of the neighborhood 5 they said they must talk to
                            the people, who were much excited over the matter, and retired for
                            awhile, then returned and asked me if I would say a few words to the
                            crowd, about 200 negroes, Creoles, and Indians, gathered outside, and
                            explain matters to them. So I went out and told them it was the
                            intention of General Cabezas to withdraw all Nicaraguan soldiers within
                            an hour after they had arrived at a settlement, and urged them not to be
                            unreasonable, but to be guided by the advice of their recognized
                            leaders. There were some dissenting voices, but finally they gave in and
                            called for “three cheers for the captain,” and I hastened back to tell
                            General Cabezas, and in a short time the Nicaraguan soldiers embarked in
                            a river boat for Rama, there being no demonstration. The Government
                            offices were turned over at once to the Mosquito officials, the gun was
                            taken from the Street, and things quieted down at once. I accompanied
                            the chief officers of the Mosquitoes to the Government house, where some
                            matters of detail were attended to.</p>
                        <p>In all these matters I merely acted as a disinterested third party and as
                            a medium for communication between the others. As regards the arms, it
                            seemed the only way to settle matters, and considering the state of the
                            community it was desirable that tranquility should be restored as soon
                            as possible. The arms have not yet been turned over to me, and I am told
                            that the rifles were distributed the night they were captured. We took
                            the breech plug from the field-piece and have it in our possession.</p>
                        <p>This final wind up took place on Saturday, the 7th instant, and I went
                            off to the ship for the first time in several days and ran down to Port
                            Limon to send a telegram to the Department as to events, returning this
                            morning.</p>
                        <p>I had intended to embark our men to-day, but the Americans are uneasy and
                            apprehensive lest a Nicaraguan force should appear and a conflict
                            follow, so I decided to have them remain where they are for the present.
                            Things will remain quiet until Nicaraguan troops come back.</p>
                        <p>The Mosquitoes have been reorganizing and perfecting their government.
                                <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0149"/>From what I have seen of
                            them they impress me as lacking strength of character and have not the
                            elements necessary for self-government. The young chief is merely a
                            puppet, and is neither bright, clever, nor well educated. It is a
                            well-known fact that they are guided by the influence of foreigners,
                            some of whom are Americans, and for tbat reason the foreigners welcome
                            their régime.</p>
                        <p>The dangerous element here is a lot of Jamaica negroes and their
                            descendants, who form part of the Mosquito faction and who entertain a
                            deadly hatred of the Nicaraguans, or Spaniards, as they call them.</p>
                        <p>I think I am safe in saying that every foreigner in the community
                            rejoices at the turn of affairs, as the Nicaraguan Government had made
                            itself so unpopular, had imposed taxes which will probably be
                            immediately repealed, and had been oppressive in various ways.</p>
                        <p>I have no idea who instigated the recent movement regarding the
                            restoration of the Mosquito chief; they took advantage of a moment of
                            disorder when the people were practically in arms against the
                            Nicaraguans and achieved a success.</p>
                        <p>I received word from Lieutenant Bowman this morning that General Cabezas
                            had expressed fears for his personal safety, or that he would be seized
                            and perhaps held as a hostage in case the Nicaraguan soldiers should
                            return, and as he is certainly in a most trying situation, having sent
                            every one of his men away, and is an official of a friendly State, and
                            was not and is not engaged in hostilities, I thought it but an act of
                            humanity to write him a note, and told him if he thought that the
                            Mosquitoes could not or would not keep their pledge as to his personal
                            safety, he could go to our camp on shore, or come off and stay with
                            me-He is in no sense a refugee.</p>
                        <p>Our consular agent, Mr. Seat, has been very thoughtful and assisted me in
                            many ways; he is evidently thoroughly respected in the community and has
                            taken a strictly neutral attitude throughout. * * *</p>
                        <p>There is no telling what will be the upshot of this matter. It seems to
                            me that the Mosquitoes had committed a grave error in attacking the
                            national troops, and as they have no organization, no leaders, and no
                            recognition as a sovereign state, their career is not likely to be a
                            long one.</p>
                        <p>The foreigners here seem to be on excellent terms with the residents of
                            the reserve, and apparently have nothing to fear at their hands unless
                            there should be a general state of disorder.</p>
                        <p>The Department can scarcely appreciate the difficulty of carrying on any
                            operations here at this time of the year. The heavy sea, constant rain,
                            and great distance from the settlement render it extremely difficult to
                            have communication, and there are days at a time when we could do
                            nothing. What is wanted is a light-draft vessel, one not drawing over 12
                            feet, that could cross the bar and lay inside, and the landing and
                            embarking of men is a source of serious anxiety. Our men have been
                            protected from the sun and rain, and the only cause for uneasiness is
                            the quality of the well water they have to drink. I did not consider it
                            prudent to land the apprentice boys, of which we have about forty, and
                            therefore left them all on board. Our men have conducted themselves with
                            great propriety, have given offense to none, and have, I am sure, been
                            by their presence a great relief to all the foreigners residing in
                            Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing more to add as regards the situation; people have not
                            yet fully recovered, but there is nothing to fear that I know of until
                            Nicaraguan troops are sent here.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully, etc.</p>

                        <p>I shall make immediate preparations for landing some men, but before they
                            laud I desire to be informed whether or not the general in command
                            (General Cabezas) has been consulted in the matter, and if it is also
                            his wish that we should land men, or if he has any doubt as to his

                            citizens in the community.</p>

                            for an emergeney; but I do not wish them landed unless the consent of
                            the Nicaraguan authorities is obtained, and request that it be so
                            obtained in writing and sent to the officer in charge of the landing

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: You have already knowledge of the
                            lamentable happenings which occurred last night in this city.</p>
                        <p>Those have placed the social interests, and particularly the life of many
                            innocents, in true danger. A mob, hidden by the darkness, surrounded the
                            government’s palace, opening fire against it, which lasted from 9 at
                            night till 4 o’clock in the morning.</p>
                        <p>My soldiers [resisted] this unjustified attack with heroic resignations,
                            withholding within their advantageous positions out of fear to make
                            other victims, as the real culpable ones; then, as you will understand,
                            a discharge from the quarters would take the center of the city, and the
                            houses being of lumber, many pacific persons who reposed in the bosom of
                            their hearth would have been immolated.</p>
                        <p>With the object to persist in this policy of clemency and conciliation, I
                            have thought that there is nothing better under the actual circumstances
                            than to place the guarding of the city, in such as refer to the police
                            department, into the hands of the honor-principled marines which you
                            command; meanwhile my Government receives exact notice upon the
                            particular point. And as I have heard of your words of amicable
                            cordiality, I allow myself to ask your assistance with a guard of
                            marines, which shall do the service under the orders of their immediate
                            chiefs and by request of the constituted authorities. This force shall
                            make that the regulations of police be complied with the laws, which
                            these abnormal circumstances be issued to secure order.</p>
                        <p>The mentioned police force shall do their service with the formalities of
                            the martial law.</p>
                        <p>I think from twenty-five to fifty marines are sufficient to comply with
                            the mission to guard order.</p>
                        <p>I hope your answer over the particular, and meantime subscribe myself
                            your respectful and obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to acknowledge the
                            receipt of your communication of this date, informing me of the
                            disturbance in the settlement of Bluefields last night by a mob, whereby
                            the lives of innocent persons were endangered and the government house
                            was fired upon, in which you practically state that the presence of an
                            armed force from the vessel under my command is necessary to guard the
                            city.</p>
                        <p>I have axlso received a memorial from the foreign cousuls and a number of
                            American citizens requesting me to land men for their protection, and
                            under existing circumstances it seems prudent to do so, and a force will
                            be lauded forthwith, but I can not undertake to guard or police the
                            city, as that duty must devolve upon the authorities.</p>
                        <p>The object of landing my men is to protect the lives and property of
                            American citizens residing in this community, and of the law-abiding
                            citizens of other foreign countries, whom you are unable to protect.</p>
                        <p>My officers and men will receive strict orders not to interfere with or
                            show favor or partiality to persons or parties on shore, or show
                            political preferences of any kind; hut it is hoped that the moral effect
                            of their presence as a strictly neutral force will have a salutary and
                            restraining effect upon the lawless members of the community.</p>
                        <p>Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Not much has transpired at Bluefields
                            since the 10th instant, the date of my last report.</p>
                        <p>On the afternoon of the 11th General Cabezas, with a few Nicaraguan civil
                            officials and sympathizers, left for Rama with all their effects, thus
                            leaving this section entirely in the hands of the Mosquitoes.</p>
                        <p>Before he left I called on him, and he thanked me very much for the offer
                            I made him the previous day, that is, to go to our camp or to come off
                            to the ship if he desired, both of which he declined. I told him that if
                            any military operations were contemplated against Bluefields I ought to
                            be informed and the people given due notice, as the place was full of
                            women and children and noncombatants, and many of my countrymen, whom it
                            was my duty to protect, and asked him to give me his assurance that
                            there should be no surprise and no night attack. He said he could not
                            say that there would or would not be operations against the place, but
                            that if there were and he had anything to say in the matter that proper
                            notice would be given. I don’t know what dependence can be placed upon
                            such assurances, but I thought it well to demand them.</p>
                        <p>The departure of all the Nicarauguans is a source of serious concern to
                            the Americans, as there is now no one here representing the sovereign
                            authority of the Republic, and I must confess I have grave apprehensions
                            as to the fate of this settlement. I asked General Cabezas if nothing
                            could be done toward an adjustment of the difficulties, so that people
                            could be relieved from the mental strain under which they were now
                            suffering, and that business might go on, etc. He replied that they (the
                            Mosquitoes, aided and advised by the foreigners) have trampled on the
                            flag of his country, killed her soldiers, and fired upon the Government
                            house, and he was not empowered to speak or say what Nicaragua’s views
                            would be, but if a settlement was desired, the only way he knew was to
                            restore everything as it was before the attack, and then talk about
                            terms.</p>
                        <p>I have been on shore most of the time of late, and yesterday asked some
                            of the leading Mosquito officials what they proposed to do, and the
                            replies were to the effect that they would maintain the stand they have
                            taken by force of arms if necessary. When I asked if they had any
                            organization or military leaders they shrugged their shoulders and said,
                            “No.” They are counting on the arrival of a British man-of-war. many of
                            the more intelligent and prominent among them believing that the British
                            will protect and uphold them in the stand they have taken, and, as they
                            express it, insist upon the Nicaraguans carrying out the treaty of
                            Managua.</p>
                        <p>I think they have done an unwise thing, and am sure that some of the more
                            thoughtful ones are of the same opinion. I understand now that the
                            Mosquito officials disavow the affair at the bluff, when the Nicaraguan
                            soldiers were shot, and say they knew nothing about it until it was
                            over, which is probably the case; but they did, however, turn the
                            episode to their advantage.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the Mosquitoes sent off to this ship the captured field piece
                            and some ammunition, and 38 Remington rifles, which are somewhat of an
                            elephant on our hands, but really I think there would have <pb n="146"
                                xml:id="pg_146" facs="0153"/>been no compromise, and would have been
                            bloodshed in the settlements had I not consented to take it.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas asked me yesterday when and where I would deliver it, and
                            I said, not where it could be used upon this community, as that was the
                            object in placing it in the hands of a third party; he then asked me to
                            deliver it at Corn Island, only 40 miles from here, when he should send
                            some soldiers there, but I think that would be an act of bad faith and
                            that I had better keep it until matters are settled in this
                            vicinity.</p>
                        <p>There has been trouble also at Corn Island; a revolt of some kind broke
                            out there a few days ago, and I have been told that some Nicaraguan
                            soldiers were shot by the Creoles, but that the latter were put down,
                            and Mr. Mongrio, late judge of the peace here, a Nicaraguan, has gone to
                            the island to settle matters.</p>
                        <p>An American named Wiltbanks is now acting as magistrate under the
                            Mosquitoes, in Bluefields; he seems to have a good deal of influence in
                            keeping order, and has organized a police force of some fifty men, and
                            at night at every few rods people are halted in the streets by policemen
                            armed with rifles, and the settlement is quiet and orderly; but the
                            people are in a state of great alarm and uneasiness, especially the
                            foreigners. I have told them they must come to our barracks if there is
                            an outbreak, as I have not men enough to scatter throughout the
                            settlement, and also said that in case of alarm if they would send word
                            to our camp we would send an escort and see them safely there.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday I sent an armed boat with 1-pounder gun and small detachment to
                            locate at “the bluff,” at the entrance to the lagoon, as there are three
                            wharves there, and some warehouses and sawmills, the property of
                            Americans, which seemed to require looking out for, and we can not keep
                            our boats, that is the steam cutter, in the water alongside, nor hoist
                            her in and out with safety, and yet require her services; so she lays in
                            at the bluff, and we have a signal code arranged at the settlement and
                            the launch and ship. I had to put a petty officer in charge, as we have
                            four line officers at the settlement and only three left in the ship,
                            having no junior officers on board.</p>
                        <p>The executive council of the Mosquito Government consists at present of
                            J. S. Lampton, American, agent of Southern Pacific Company; Charles
                            Lobner, American, from Pearl Cay Lagoon; H. T. Springer, American,

                        <p>They have been holding meetings, and so far I understand their efforts
                            have been in the direction of “ways and means;” in arranging for
                            carrying on the government, collecting the revenue, etc.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas carried off the books and records of the provisional
                            government, which he said belonged to Nicaragua; but be told me the day
                            before that the Nicaraguan Government never recognized the provisional
                            council.</p>
                        <p>It is a pity that these people, the Mosquitoes, have not some one to
                            advise them and look out for their interests, for they are surely not
                            competent to do it for themselves. The agitators are, as usual, of the
                            class who have nothing to lose. Many of the better class of Americans
                            here say that they would be thankful to get out of the country if they
                                <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0154"/>could realize fifty cents
                            on the dollar on their property, and all this commotion, is directly due
                            to the forcible occupancy of “the reserve” by the Nicaraguans.</p>
                        <p>No one knows what will happen next, but the wildest rumors are afloat,
                            and the community is in an unhappy frame of mind. They (the foreigners)
                            say they feel comparatively secure while we have men on shore, and
                            consequently I shall not withdraw them at present, but do not like the
                            idea of having them remain a long time, as it is very rainy and damp,
                            and I am somewhat apprehensive of fever and malaria, but so far all are
                            well and in good condition.</p>
                        <p>Our force is not very strong numerically, as I do not think the moral
                            effect of sending the apprentices on shore, many of whom are mere boys,
                            would be good.</p>
                        <p>“The Chief” Clarence has left the British consulate, where he has been
                            domiciled for several weeks, and has gone to his own residence in the
                            settlement.</p>
                        <p>The most unsatisfactory aspect of things at present is that no steps are
                            being taken looking toward an adjustment of matters, and the Mosquitoes
                            are in fact in an attitude of hostility toward the supreme Government.
                            They simply say that they have only resumed the rights which belong to
                            them and of which they were forcibly deprived by the Nicaraguans in
                            February last.</p>
                        <p>The welfare of Americans and their interests are not permanently
                            benefited by the presence of an armed force, which simply gives them
                            temporary security. What is wanted is peace and some established order
                            of things, that business may go on and the industries that have been
                            built up by American enterprise and capital may not be destroyed.</p>
                        <p>It is impossible, in my opinion, for the Mosquitoes to maintain the stand
                            they have taken without outside aid, and while at present any
                            proposition to compromise would undoubtedly be received with great
                            disfavor by their party, it is probable that the wiser and more
                            thoughtful people would realize the necessity of coming to terms with
                            the supreme Government.</p>
                        <p>In view of the unusual interests which Americans have in this vicinity,
                            and which will be vitally affected by the final settlement, it seems as
                            if the friendly offices of the United States might be invoked to aid in
                            bringing about some adjustment rather than have it settled by
                            bloodshed.</p>
                        <p>Nicaragua can afford to be patient, and I do believe that some
                            satisfactory solution of affairs could be reached that would save this
                            little community from destruction, but there seems to be nobody who has
                            the ability or the good judgment, on the part of the Mosquitoes, to
                            propose anything, and there are no Nicaraguan officials here, and so we
                            simply wait for further developments, without any idea as to what their
                            character may be.</p>
                        <p>The Department may rest assured that I shall preserve strict neutrality
                            so far as we are concerned.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have just received information that a
                            Norwegian steamer named the <hi rend="italic">George Seeley</hi>, eu
                            route for Bluefields from New York, is wrecked in Roncador Reef, and
                            were it not that the situation here demands the presence of this vessel
                            would go immediately to the scene of the disaster. One of her boats has
                            reached this place, and fortunately there is a small steamer here which
                            has been secured to go to the wreck. I have not learned whether any
                            lives were lost or not.</p>
                        <p>The weather has been so rough that no communication has been held with
                            the settlement until late in the evening, when our steam cutter brought
                            out to me a document in Spanish, of which a translation is inclosed,
                            said document being a protest, as it were, emanating from the
                            provisional council, against the acts and utterances of the party or
                            faction headed by Robert Henry Clarence (the hereditary chief). It will
                            be observed that no protest is issued in the name of the sovereign
                            power, but in the name of the provisional council, which has been for
                            some time a myth, as, in point of fact. General Cabezas, the acting
                            commissioner, told me himself it was merely a figure of speech. For some
                            reason nothing is done in the name of Nicaragua, but this provisional
                            council, which General Cabezas told me his Government did not recognize,
                            is always put to the front and everything is done in its name, implying
                            that the Government of Nicaragua is not meddling with the affairs of the
                            reserve, but it is patent to everybody that its officials are acting
                            under orders.</p>
                        <p>I have a note from Lieutenant Bowman, in charge of our men on shore,
                            saying that the consular agent thought of sending the archives of his
                            office to our barracks, and that of course he would receive them.</p>
                        <p>All kinds of rumors are afloat calculated to alarm the people, but in
                            view of present circumstances that is to be expected.</p>
                        <p>The D. H. Thomas who signs the inclosed copy is said to be a very shrewd
                            and clever colored lawyer, who was the brains of the provisional
                            council, and who worked in the interest of Nicaragua. H, G. Higley is an
                            American who held the position of land commissioner under the
                            provisional council, and is the only American I have heard of who has
                            not been opposed in sentiment to Nicaraguan rule.</p>
                        <p>General Cabezas has addressed me a letter from llama, which has not as
                            yet been wholly translated, but which appears to be simply an argument
                            to show the Nicaraguan Government has been outraged and insulted.</p>

                        <p>On the Escondido River, in the Mosquito Reservation, at the hour of 4
                            p.m. of the clock, this 12th day of July, 1894, the members of the
                            provisional council of the said Mosquito Reservation, assembled by
                            request of the President to consider and deliberate upon the events
                            which occurred at Bluefields on the 5th and lasted until the 8th of July
                            instant.</p>
                        <p>The acting commissioner (General Cabezas) informed the board that on
                            account of very peremptory duties imposed upon him by the occurrences
                            referred to, he had <pb n="149" xml:id="pg_149" facs="0156"/>appointed
                            in his stead as president of the council Mr. D. H. Thomas, who was
                            immediately called upon and invited to accept the duties of the
                            office.</p>
                        <p>Under the presidence of Mr. D. H. Thomas it was laid before the council,
                            for its consideration, a proclamation issued by Mr. Robert Henry
                            Clarence, in which he declares having resumed power and authority in the
                            Mosquito Reserve, which had been withdrawn from him by the authority of
                            the sovereign power, and in virtue of a special convention entered into
                            by the Nicaraguan commission and the consul of Her Britannic
                            Majesty.</p>
                        <p>The council declared that the action of the said Robert Henry Clarence,
                            apart from being illegal, constitutes a flagrant usurpation of
                            authority, accompanied with crimes of the following nature: <list>

                                    destroying and tearing the Nicaraguan flag to pieces was

                                    commissioner, at the same time vociferating and uttering
                                    seditious language, disturbing the public peace, threatening

                                    American, Mr. Wilson. This is urgently required by justice and
                                    by the necessity of giving a warning to others who may be

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have learned that Norberto Argüello, who
                            has committed the crime of murder, is at Bocas del Toro. This criminal
                            made his escape from the jail here on the 9th ultimo, and the
                            aggravating circumstance in the case is that this is his second offence,
                            he having previously escaped from the jail at Rama. Argüello killed an
                            American citizen named William Wilson, and, owing to the fact that the
                            murdered man <pb n="151" xml:id="pg_151" facs="0158"/>was a foreigner,
                            the act has given rise to a difficulty with the American Republic. In
                            view of the cordial relations existing between the Government of
                            Columbia and that of Nicaragua, and of the fraternal bonds which have
                            united the two nations, I have thought that a request from me would be
                            favorably received by you, especially since public justice has been
                            doubly outraged by the criminal, and since the credit of the Nicaraguan
                            authorities may be said to be at stake, inasmuch as they are charged,
                            although unjustly, with partiality in this matter.</p>
                        <p>I beg you, in virtue of the foregoing, to be pleased to issue orders for
                            the arrest of the aforesaid Argüello, and to place him in secure custody
                            until the minister of foreign affairs can present a formal demand for
                            his extradition.</p>

                        in regard to the uprising at Bluefields.</p>
                    <p>It is noted with interest and some surprise that the report of General
                        Cabezas to Senor Madriz speaks of the rising as “led by a Hollander,

                        the same name and nationality.</p>
                    <p>While the statements of Senor Madriz and those received here from the

                        rising to the negroes, the alleged participation of the American residents
                        of Blue-fields is denied by our recent advices. According to Captain O’Neil
                            <pb n="152" xml:id="pg_152" facs="0159"/>but two or three citizens of

                        this legation, in which you inclose a translation of a communication
                        addressed to me by. Mr. Madriz, late special commissioner to Mosquito, is at
                        hand, and its-contents carefully noted.</p>
                    <p>I endeavored to state to you as clearly as I could the reasons which prompted
                        me in suggesting to Mr. Madriz, on the 5th of May, the removal of the troops
                        from Bluefields to the bluff as a conciliatory measure. There was no hint of
                        a denial of the sovereign right of Nic-aragau to place their troops in
                        Bluefields.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Madriz having made the order, through Commissioner Lacayo, the troops
                        having been removed under that order, while Mr. Madriz was still in
                        Bluefields, and having, in violation of that order, been returned to
                        Bluefields by Lacayo, I deemed it my duty to call Mr. Madriz’s attention to
                        this additional evidence of the contempt with which that official continued

                        this is why I did not, iu illustrating this point, quote Mr. Madriz’s
                        explanation as to how he came to the conclusion to make the order referred
                        to. There was never any question between him and me on that point.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the evening of August 2 Mr. Gustavo Guzman
                        came to this legation bearing, as he informed me, a verbal message from the
                        President, to the following effect: <list>
                            <item>First. That the Government had sent a large number of troops to
                                    <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0160"/>San Juan del Norte,
                                where they had just arrived, on their way to Blue-fields.</item>
                            <item>Second. That this Government had chartered the steamboat <hi
                                    rend="italic">Yulu</hi>, a boat owned by the Emory Company of
                                Boston, flying the United States flag, to transport these troops
                                from San Juan del Norte to Bluefields.</item>
                            <item>Third. That now the captain and crew of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Yulu</hi>, all Americans, refuse to carry the soldiers, for the
                                reason that Commander O’Neil, of the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Marblehead</hi>, had issued a proclamation forbidding vessels
                                under the flag of the United States from “carrying bodies of armed
                                men or military supplies” for either “party” to the controversy in
                                the Mosquito territory.</item>
                            <item>Fourth. The President, therefore, requested that I, as United
                                States minister, issue an order to the captain and crew of the
                                steamer <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>, assuring them that they run no
                                risk in disobeying the warning of Commander O’Neil.</item>
                        </list></p>
                    <p>I could not believe it to be my duty to comply with this request; but, at the
                        suggestion of Mr. Guzman, I gave him the accompanying telegram, marked
                        Inclosure No. 1, which he had liberty to send if he so desired. Inclosure
                        No. 2 is a copy of the proclamation of Commander O’Neil referred to.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: To-day, in a personal interview at the foreign
                        office with Lord Kimberley, his lordship, referring to the presence of the
                        two armed ships of the United States and Great Britain at Bluefields, said
                        there would be no difficulty in their keeping order, and he deprecated very
                        positively the use of the name of the Mosquito Indians as a shield under
                        which foreign residents sought to wage war in opposition to Nicaragua, and
                        said that the presence of the British vessel and armed forces had no other
                        object or purpose than to protect the lives and property of British
                        residents during a period of lawlessness and strife, and that the only
                        desire of his Government beyond that was to induce the Nicaraguans to treat
                        the Indians with forbearance and moderation, and not shoot them down, as
                        they were very apt to do.</p>
                    <p>I took the opportunity to repeat what I had stated to his lordship on a
                        former occasion—that the United States were wholly opposed to the employment
                        of the fiction of a Mosquito government to organize an opposition to the
                        Government of Nicaragua, which had no connection whatever with the customs
                        and domestic usages of the Mosquito Indians, and that American citizens
                        would not be allowed to set up any such government under any pretext.</p>
                    <p>I can but confirm, and need not here repeat, the views heretofore expressed
                        to you in my dispatch of the 28th of May last, in relation to the attitude
                        and purposes of Great Britain toward Nicaragua and the Mosquito
                        Reservation.</p>
                    <p>What Lord John Russell wrote to Mr. Crampton in 1853 about Mosquito Indians
                        who, instead of governing their own tribe according to their own laws and
                        customs, were lending their name and title to a medley of Europeans and
                        Americans to trade at Grey Town and Bluefields, not according to Indian
                        usages and customs, but wholly in opposition to such usages, was true when
                        his lordship so expressed it, and in the passage of events has been
                        emphasized, and is to-day absolutely undeniable.</p>
                    <p>I am quite clear, however, that the easiest and most complete and
                        satisfactory solution of any difficulty lies wholly in the power of the
                        rulers of Nicaragua, who can, by the exercise of a wise and humane policy of
                        treatment of the Indians of Mosquito, deprive the British Government of all
                        possible pretext to interfere in any way with the practical and unqualified
                        exercise of sovereignty by Nicaragua over the entire region.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0162"/>
                    <p>Satisfied, as Nicaragua must be, that the United States have not the
                        slightest desire to impair its full control over the Mosquito coast and will
                        discourage all attempts from any quarter to impose conditions upon Nicaragua
                        in the conduct of her domestic affairs—asking only that the legitimate
                        rights of American residents may receive the just protection of equal
                        laws—it is wholly within her power to give the treaty of Managua its full
                        force and intent, and secure an unquestioned and unqualified sovereignty for
                        Nicaragua over the whole territory by establishing such a condition of law
                        and order that no pretext for interference can be set up in any quarter.</p>
                    <p>Such a course will insure to capital that safety that is essential to its
                        voluntary presence and employment and promote the great work of joining the
                        waters of the two great oceans, together with the infinite commerce that
                        would necessarily stream across Nicaraguan territory, bringing her
                        inhabitants into the closest and most profitable relations with the world’s
                        wealth and higher civilization.</p>
                    <p>The obvious wisdom of such a course is indubitable, for peace at home must be
                        accompanied with prosperity, and a final abandonment of all attempts to
                        subject Nicaragua to an interpretation of the Managua treaty by a foreign
                        imperial Government (Austria), to which she most imprudently assented in
                        1879, without notification or consultation with the United States.</p>
                    <p>It is not the treaty of Managua, but the Austrian construction of that
                        convention, which has given Great Britain the only possible ground of
                        argument in favor of an interference, which is inconsistent with the
                        sovereignty of Nicaragua over the Mosquito coast, and would involve in its
                        acceptance an infraction, in letter and in spirit, of the stipulations of
                        Great Britain with the United States in the Clayton-Bui wer treaty.</p>
                    <p>Undefined obligations are always the most embarrassing, and the trace of
                        responsibility for the personal safety of a feeble remnant of an inferior
                        and deteriorating race who were once under her protection in some degree
                        survives, and creates hesitation on the part of Great Britain formally and
                        finally to abandon her obligation to interfere when her former protégés are
                        threatened with gross injustice and oppression.</p>
                    <p>This is made apparent by Lord Salisbury’s note to Mr. Edwardes March 7, 1889,
                        and has been accentuated in Lord Kimberley’s conversations with me. Nor can
                        there be any doubt that the condition of affairs in Nicaragua and in the
                        Mosquito Reservation has undergone an entire transformation within the last
                        thirty-four years, and is now more than ever rapidly progressing into a
                        state in which no feature existing in 1850 can be traced.</p>
                    <p>I am fully persuaded that, with good temper and judicious and just treatment
                        of her citizens inhabiting the Mosquito region, Nicaragua will be wholly
                        undisturbed by interference by the United States or Great Britain, and
                        assuredly by this time her rulers and people should be satisfied with the
                        disinterestedness and friendly good faith which actuates the Government of
                        the United States in all their relations with Nicaragua.</p>

                        the States had departed, I received the letter from Minister Madriz, herein

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I submit to you and through you
                            to His Excellency, the President, for your and his information, two
                            official reports received by me from Bluefields. Please observe that
                            they are to be returned to me.</p>
                        <p>(1) In the fourteenth paragraph of Commander O’Neil’s report you will not
                            fail to observe the following: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>But I must confess that I find that the-sympathies of nearly all
                                    the foreigners arc with the Mosquito government.</p>
                            </quote></p>
                        <p>The reason (I think you will agree with me) is plain. Nicaragua has
                            failed to give those people a more satisfactory government than the old
                            regime did. In other words, Nicaraguan officials sent to rule those
                            people have not, by their official acts, succeeded in gaining the
                            confidence of the foreign citizens of the reserve. Confidence inspires
                            loyalty. All those people can be made your warm friends and defenders if
                            a just and conciliatory course is pursued by you.</p>
                        <p>(2) I call your attention to the report of B.B. Seat, esq., United States
                            consular agent at Blueflelds, made to Consul Braida. This report gives
                            internal evidence of its unvarnished truthfulness. On page 8 of this
                            report, Mr. Seat gives it as his opinion that no American of any
                            standing, and perhaps no one, had anything to do with the late
                            uprising.</p>
                        <p>(3) I beg to call your excellency’s attention to inclosure No. 3. Such
                            arbitrary, unjust, and utterly senseless action as the one here reported
                            will not go a long way toward creating a public sentiment among the
                            foreigners residing in the Mosquito Reserve for the Supreme Government
                            of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>(4) A Mrs. Anderson, whose husband resides near Grey Town, called upon me
                            yesterday, and stated that an attempt was made at Grey Town to collect a
                            large amount of duties upon their household goods, effects, etc.,
                            contrary to law. But, as she said she was going directly to the proper
                            minister about the matter, I presume she had no difficulty in having the
                            matter adjusted in a just manner.</p>
                        <p>(5) My fourth inclosure is a telegram from Henry Palazio, esq., in
                            reference to the mate of the steamship <hi rend="italic">San Jose</hi>.
                            If there is anything <pb n="157" xml:id="pg_157" facs="0164"/>either you
                            or I can do to get this matter settled in a just way, kindly let me
                            know.</p>
                        <p>I beg your careful and thoughtful attention to all of the inclosures; and
                            I will ask you to preserve and return them all to me.</p>
                        <p>With sentiments of high esteem, I have the honor to subscribe myself,
                            your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have read to the President your
                            excellency’s valuable communication of yesterday, and its contents have
                            been well noted.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency is acquainted with this Government’s policy toward the
                            Mosquito Reservation. It is interested in the peace and prosperity of
                            that region, by means of a system of liberty and justice. If unusual
                            circumstances have prevented the fulfillment of its desires, the
                            soundness of its principles remains beyond doubt.</p>
                        <p>I fully appreciate the fact that the foreigners and particularly the
                            Jamaicans are more in sympathy with the old regime. It would be absurd
                            to suppose otherwise. The reservation has been unconditionally under
                            their control, and therefore the intervention of an authority which
                            watches bud corrects irregularities is not at all pleasing to them.</p>
                        <p>I have been pained to observe the harshness with which Vice-Consul Seat
                            speaks of Nicaragua; but it is not the first time he has done so. During
                            his recent visit to the United States the American press echoed his
                            sentiments, which were highly offensive to the honor of this people.
                            Such a thing is not becoming in one of his position, and I should be
                            much pained if some day an official communication of that nature should
                            pass between us, because I should be unwillingly compelled to call Mr.
                            Seat to the path of decorum and procedure according to the practices of
                            international law.</p>
                        <p>I especially call your excellency’s attention to the closing words of Mr.
                            Seat’s letter to Consul Braida: “If an attack were made now it would be
                            a very different thing Iroui when Lacayo arrived here some months ago.”
                            These words contain a threat and show that Mr. Seat is in sympathy with
                            the rebellion. They remain from now on, as a precedent for an
                            investigation, which I shall make upon my arrival at Blue-fields. I do
                            not consider this latter as difficult as Mr. Seat thinks.</p>
                        <p>As to that relating to the detention of steamers, I have to say that as
                            there is a custom-house at Rama, the entering or leaving the port at
                            night is necessarily prohibited for the protection of the fiscal
                            interests. If this is a detriment to private interests, much greater
                            damage would be caused to the Government under a contrary regulation,
                            because it would expose the port to smuggling.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, according to the laws of the reservation, ships carrying
                            articles of commerce to any point therein are obliged to stop at
                            Blue-fields and have their cargo examined and pay the customs dues. Why
                            does not Mr. Seat complain about this?</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the above, the Government knows that General Cabezas has
                            reestablished, as heretofore, traffic at all hours.</p>
                        <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0165"/>
                        <p>It is evident from Mr. Seat’s confession that Americans have taken part
                            in the recent disturbances.</p>
                        <p>The policy which the Government intends to pursue in the Bluefields
                            affair will be strictly legal, but dignified and firm. It will make
                            peace if the offenders submit 5 but it can not overlook the spilling of
                            blood on the bluff and at Corn Island.</p>
                        <p>The above remarks do not refer to your excellency, in whom I am pleased
                            to recognize a frank and well-intentioned conduct. God grant that your
                            excellency may be able to change Vice-Consul Seat’s mind, and to
                            convince the Americans that the Government of Nicaragua is not nor can
                            be hostile to their interests.</p>
                        <p>As to the affair of Mrs. Anderson, the governor intendente of San Juan
                            del Norte has been ordered not to collect the duties which, undoubtedly
                            through error, had been imposed.</p>
                        <p>The case of the piloto (mate) of the <hi rend="italic">San Jose</hi> is
                            being tried according to law, and in this connection I must inform your
                            excellency that the Government was pained to see the refusal of the
                            captain of the steamer to deliver the offender, knowing that the ship
                            and all persons aboard were subject to the jurisdiction of the port
                            authority. A warning of this kind to the captains may, in the future,
                            avoid illegal pretensions on their part.</p>
                        <p>I send a copy of this communication to our representative in
                            Washington.</p>
                        <p>With all respect, I subscribe myself, your obedient servant,</p>

                            and their property, and inclose copy (marked A) of his reply.</p>
                        <p>I had an object in procuring his views in the matter, being inclined to
                            the opinion that they would prefer to have our men embarked and the
                            British sailors on shore, and I thought I would manage to have him <pb
                                n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0166"/>put himself on record and
                            request me to continue our men on shore rather than to have him tell me
                            later on that he did not wish them there.</p>
                        <p>Of course he speaks only through his council, in which are some
                            Americans, and they are only too anxious we should remain; but leaving
                            out the question of their wishes, I think prudence demands that they
                            shall for the present stay on shore.</p>
                        <p>(2) In my first letter after the troubles broke out on July 51 stated
                            that the attack on the Government house, in my opinion, had no
                            connection with the affairs which followed and was simply the work of a
                            mob; but as things leak out and are talked about I am led to believe
                            that it hail been contemplated before, but was precipitated by the
                            events of the dry, that is, the nonpayment and harsh treatment of the
                            police. On that evening not only were Jamaica negroes out in force, but
                            some white men, and they were in search of one Dr. Kuhun and one Higley,
                            two Americans who had been identified for some time with the Nicaraguan
                            commissioner, and who were very unpopular, and had they found these two
                            men that night it would probably have fared badly with them. Some
                            Americans were with the crowd that night, and are anxious to prove now
                            that, though they had arms, they did not fire on the Government
                            house.</p>
                        <p>(3) Immediately after the chief had issued his proclamation on July 6 an
                            American named George B. Wiltbank was appointed magistrate by the
                            Mosquito party, and he appointed as chief of police an American named
                            Folks or Foulke. The latter, as soon as he was appointed, wrote a letter
                            to the Nicaraguan soldiers stationed at the bluff, directing them to
                            surrender, and this letter was taken down by the party that surprised
                            and captured them, and is said to be in the hands of Nicaraguan
                            officials at Rama. Foulke has just left the country, I understand, being
                            of the opinion that it would not be a good place for him here if the
                            Nicaraguans return. He is said to have given as an excuse for his
                            actions the reason that, as chief of police, it was his duty to remove
                            as far as possible any causes which might lead to trouble, and so, as a
                            precaution, he proposed to remove the Nicaraguan soldiers.</p>
                        <p>(4) On the day the trouble broke out (5th instant) a young American named
                            Williamson, in the employ of the Bluefields Banana Company, in a half
                            intoxicated condition, went into General Cabezas’s office and flourished
                            a revolver, declared himself “governor of Bluefields.” I am sure the
                            general would have been justified in having him locked up for breach of
                            the peace, but he let him go.</p>
                        <p>(5) At Principulca I am told by good authority that the Nicaraguan
                            governor got alarmed and left, and that the Americans elected one of
                            their number as governor and hoisted the American flag, but that since
                            then a Mosquito official has been there and installed a magistrate.</p>
                        <p>(6) I mention these matters to give the Department a correct idea of how
                            Americans have mixed in local matters, and it will, readily be seen how
                            it complicates the situation. I think they are beginning to be
                            thoroughly frightened, however.</p>
                        <p>(6<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Under Mosquito rule the planters hired or
                            leased land at 3 cents an acre per annum for fifty years, and at present
                            value of local coin their rental is 1½ cents per acre in United States
                            currency. The Nicaraguans do not look with favor upon such leases.</p>
                        <p>(7) The inclosed letter (marked B) was received on the 24th from the
                            British vice-consul, and seemed so urgent that I wrote a reply, saying
                            that I would be glad to extend the same protection to such of Her
                            Majesty’s subjects who had not been participators in political affairs
                            as <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0167"/>to our own people, and then
                            hurried on shore to see what the matter was, and concluded that the
                            vice-consul had become unnecessarily alarmed on account of a letter he
                            had received from Rama.</p>
                        <p>That part of his letter in which he says: “What have we as foreigners to
                            do with, this question?” is, to Bay the least, entertaining, as the
                            foreigners seem to have been at the bottom of the whole business, and
                            Her Majesty’s subjects are a pretty bad lot of Jamaicans, who are
                            Mosquitos or otherwise, as suits the occasion. At first I thought they
                            were working up a scare to get the British sailors on shore as soon as
                            the <hi rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> returned; but I think they were really
                            alarmed, and my advice was, be neutral and remain tranquil.</p>
                        <p>(8) As the Department is aware, the chiefs Clarence, was brought here
                            from Pearl Lagone some weeks ago by H. M. S. <hi rend="italic"
                                >magicienne</hi>, and on July 3, just before the outbreak, the
                            vice-president, Paterson, and attorney-general, Cuthbert, of the old
                            Mosquito Government appeared on the scene, and it is thought that a coup
                            d’ etat was to be made, but not expected so soon or in the manner it
                            finally assumed.</p>
                        <p>(9) There are a good many waifs of all nationalities in the community
                            here, cast up by the collapse of the Panama and Nicaragua canals, and
                            they are ready for anything.</p>
                        <p>(10) This vessel will probably have to go somewhere for coal in three or
                            four weeks, and unless there is a marked improvement in the situation by
                            that time we ought to have another vessel here, unless matters are left
                            to the British war ship for the time being.</p>
                        <p>(11) The United States consular agent at Grey Town has written to our
                            consular agent here that there is a prospect of trouble there of a
                            political character, and they, too, would like to have a man-of-war
                            visit the port.</p>
                        <p>(12) Some of the Americans here who have accepted civil office under the
                            Mosquito Government, such, for example, as members of the council, have
                            asked me how it affected their status as regarded their own country, and
                            I have said that, in my opinion, in ordinary times if the Mosquito
                            constitution permitted aliens to be members of its council, and they
                            chose to give their services in such purely civil capacities, I did not
                            think there was any impropriety, if by so doing they could benefit the
                            community in which they dwelt, but that in in times of political
                            disorder they ran the risk of becoming entangled, and if they got into
                            difficulty thereby they had not the same claim to protection as if they
                            had taken no part, even though it be a civil one, in local affairs, and
                            they become marked ineu and are liable to suffer in some way if the
                            opposite side gains the ascendancy. They say they have great interests
                            at stake, and so have many Americans, and it is only by taking part in
                            such deliberative and executive bodies as are open to them that they can
                            protect or have any say as to the management of their affairs.</p>
                        <p>(13) I believe that one of Nicaragua’s arguments against the Mosquito
                            Government is that it has been subverted and has lost its identity as a
                            purely local government by and for the Indians, having passed into the
                            hands of Jamaica negroes and other foreigners, which is doubtless
                            correct, and since the port of Bluefields has become so important and so
                            much foreign capital, mostly American, has been invested in the country,
                            the foreigners found the Mosquito Government dominated by Jamaica
                            negroes—so inefficient and ignorant and unequal to keep pace with the
                            growth of the place that they were greatly dissatisfied, as there were
                            no competent courts, nor means for protecting commercial interests in a
                            legal way, and all important matters had to be settled “out of
                            court”—hence <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0168"/>they felt it
                            necessary for their own protection, when the way was open for them to
                            sit in the council, to do so.</p>
                        <p>(14) July 26. H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> has returned from
                            Port Limon and brings me a telegram dated the 19th instant, from United
                            Spates Minister Baker, at Managua, to the effect that Madriz, the
                            Nicaraguan minister of the interior, had left for Bluefields and would
                            bring me letters from him (Baker). This is the most hopeful sign yet, as
                            it indicates an intention on the part of Nicaragua to investigate
                            matters rather than to resort to immediate violence. I sent a note to
                            Rama at once to inform General Cabezas that Minister Madriz was on his
                            way here.</p>
                        <p>(15) The commander of the <hi rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> (Stuart) informed
                            me that, in reply to a dispatch sent by him to his Government, he had
                            been directed to abstain from any interference in local matters and to
                            use his best efforts to prevent a conflict. If the Mosquito faction knew
                            this, they would collapse, I am sure, for they have [been] counting all
                            along on British support.</p>
                        <p>(16) Commander Stuart also told me he did not intend to land men unless
                            it became absolutely necessary to do so to protect his countrymen, and
                            he did not think it was advisable to have parties of sailors of
                            different nationalities on shore at the same time, and I agree with
                            him.</p>
                        <p>(17) Minister Madriz was here before, soon after the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Cleopatra</hi> incident, and understands the situation fully.</p>
                        <p>(18) At this moment things are quiet, and there is no news to add
                            concerning the situation.</p>
                        <p>(19) Commander Stuart of the <hi rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> has written a
                            letter to General Cabezas in a very friendly spirit, offering to use his
                            good offices in any way to restore order, and saying that, if he will
                            give him the names of any British subjects who took part in the attack
                            on the Government house or on the Nicaraguan soldiers, he will take them
                            to Jamaica and hand them over to the authorities there.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor respectfully to
                            acknowledge receipt of your letter of this day’s date as follows: “As
                            yon are aware, a party of sailors and marines were landed from this
                            vessel on the 6th instant, before yon issued your proclamation on that
                            day announcing that you had resumed your rightful authority, etc. The
                            object of this landing was to protect, if necessary, American citizens
                            and their property, which, owing to the disturbed state of the
                            community, seemed to he insecure,” etc.</p>
                        <p>In reply I beg leave to state to yon that the same has had my serions
                            attention and consideration, and I have observed that yon say “before
                            landing any men, I called upon the then recognized authorities, that is,
                            upon the acting commissioner to the reserve, representing the Government
                            of Nicaragua, and by virture of his office as president of the
                            provisional council, representing the local government, to ascertain if
                            there was any objection to our landing, and in the presence of the
                            United States consular agent was not only told that there was none, hut
                            that under the circumstances it seemed a prudent thing to do, and a
                            written communication to that effect was given me.”</p>
                        <p>I have also to commend your action as being a prudent thing, as the
                            presence of your men insured confidence and prevented some serious
                            consequences.</p>
                        <p>I observed also that yon had Said that you “would have withdrawn your men
                            ere this but was requested not to do so by some of the Americans, who
                            feared that permanent order had not been restored.” I further see that
                            you are desirous that your men should return to their vessel, and beg to
                            inquire, as I have been in undisputed <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162"
                                facs="0169"/>possession of the place for sixteen days, whether I can
                            and will guarantee the security of your countrymen and their property
                            residing in this community or whether, in my opinion, it is desirable
                            that you should continue your men on shore for a longer period.</p>
                        <p>As to my opinion, I could not guarantee the security of your countrymen
                            or their property residing in this community from the attacks of any
                            armed force or forces, but I am satisfied that the quiet and peaceable
                            inhabitants are law abiding, and I have exercised my every influence to
                            restore the peace and tranquillity of the people. Under these
                            circumstances, as you have a personal knowledge of the state of the
                            community, I would earnestly advise you to use your best judgment and
                            discretion, with the advice of the commander of Her Majesty’s ship <hi

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir:</hi> (1) I have previously informed the
                            department that General Cabezas, the acting commissioner to the Mosquito
                            Reserve, had with-, drawn to Rama, which is up the river Escondido about
                            60 miles above Bluefields, and just outside the limits of the reserve.
                            He left here on the 11th, and arriving at Kama on the 12th declared that
                            place under martial law on that date. A copy of his proclamation is sent
                            herewith, marked B.</p>
                        <p>(2) On the 14th I received a petition from some of the native residents
                            (copy herewith, marked A), followers of the Mosquito chief, asking me to
                            protect them. I have not made any reply, as I can do nothing for them
                            except to advise them to try and make some compromise.</p>
                        <p>(3) On the same day I received from the United States consular agent
                            notice of the detention at Kama, by order of General Cabezas, of the tug
                                <hi rend="italic">Ada Hart</hi>, owned by an American Company (The
                            Bluefields Banana Company); also of a barge at the same place belonging
                            to the same company, containing 1,500 bunches of bananas, which had been
                            cut to be shipped in the company’s steamer <hi rend="italic">John
                                Wilson</hi>, then in the river below, but the tugs were not
                            permitted to tow the barge below Rama.</p>
                        <p>(4) I immediately addressed a letter to General Cabezas, protesting
                            against the restrictions placed upon American boats and demanding their
                            immediate release.</p>
                        <pb n="163" xml:id="pg_163" facs="0170"/>
                        <p>(5) The next morning (the 15th instant) the Norwegian steamer <hi
                                rend="italic">Uspana</hi> came out from the river and anchored near
                            us, and a Mr. Orr, representing the firm of Orr &amp; Lauberheimer
                            Company, of Mobile, and a Mr. Tally, representing Messrs. Brown &amp;
                            Harris, agents for the Southern Pacific Company, all American firms and
                            individuals, came on board with copies of protests made before the
                            United States consular agent, to the effect that their tugs had been
                            stopped from going below Rama and in consequence they could not carry on
                            their business.</p>
                        <p>(6) As the <hi rend="italic">Espana</hi> was chartered by the American
                            firm of Orr &amp; Lauberheimer and has only been permitted to take on
                            board half her cargo, that is, fruit from above Kama only, I concluded
                            that the best thing to do was for me to go up to Rama in her and see
                            General Cabezas, and take such steps as might be necessary to enable the
                            cargo below Kama, which was cut and on the river banks, to be shipped,
                            to do which it was necessary that the company’s tugs <hi rend="italic"
                                >Alerta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Buena Ventura</hi> should be
                            permitted to go down the river.</p>
                        <p>(5) I accordingly went on board the <hi rend="italic">Espana</hi>, and
                            she proceeded, stopping at the bluff to take in tow our steam cutter
                            with crew of nine men and a 1–pounder gun, as I might require her to
                            return in.</p>
                        <p>(6) Reaching Rama at 5 p.m., I went on shore and saw General Cabezas, and
                            asked him what he meant by practically seizing steamers which were
                            American property and engaged in their legitimate business. He began to
                            talk about precaution and military necessity and that the town was under
                            martial law. I told him I had come up to talk over matters with him, but
                            before going further I had to request that he would give orders for the
                            immediate release of the tugs, and that the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Espana</hi> might be permitted to load and proceed on her voyage at
                            once, as every hour’s delay was disastrous to her cargo of fruit. After
                            some little discussion the necessary orders were given, and the steamer
                            and tugs proceeded down the river.</p>
                        <p>(7) I told General Cabezas that until the port of Rama was officially
                            closed and notice thereof sent to the foreign consuls and naval
                            commanders that American citizens, with their boats and other
                            properties, should be allowed to pass unmolested, and that should he
                            choose to close the port he must give due notice and allow foreigners to
                            depart if they choose; and I asked him to sign a written assurance to
                            the effect that he would guarantee it, but he did not like the form I
                            put it in, but agreed in substance, and I secured the release of five
                            tugs and launches owned by Americans. I was glad he released the boats,
                            for I intended to take them down the river with me if he refused, and my
                            visit was quite opportune, as three fruit steamers have arrived since,
                            and had no arrangements been made as to the use of the tugs they could
                            not have received their cargoes.</p>
                        <p>(8) I told General Cabezas his Government would have to pay for the 1,500
                            bunches of bananas he prevented the steamer <hi rend="italic">John
                                Wilson</hi> from taking.</p>
                        <p>(9) I regret to say that some injudicious Americans have been active
                            participants in the political affairs now in such a tangle here. The
                            Mosquito chief was undoubtedly induced to proclaim himself by promises
                            of assistance from foreigners, and a few Americans have figured in a
                            prominent manner in the Mosquito council and local government; and worse
                            yet, it is pretty well known that at least two Americans were concerned
                            in the attack on the Nicaraguan soldiers at the bluff.</p>
                        <p>(10) The Jamaica negroes, who form a large portion of the supporters of
                            the Mosquito chief, seem to have been clever enough to make use of the
                            willing services of some foolish Americans, and they have all <pb
                                n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0171"/>pinned their faith on the
                            coming of a British man-of-war to support them in the stand they have
                            taken.</p>
                        <p>(11) I advise them to try and effect some compromise or settlement in
                            order that they may be relieved from their present state of anxiety, and
                            the wiser ones are already beginning to agitate the subject, for they
                            are getting tired of patrolling the streets at night and not knowing how
                            they stand with the outside world. With perhaps a couple of exceptions,
                            the Americans mixed up in [the] affair do not represent any interest
                            worth speaking of. Those who stand best in the community have kept out
                            of it, though their sympathies are not with the Nicaraguans, whom they
                            consider oppressive, and the Mosquitoes they consider a&amp; in
                            competent.</p>
                        <p>(12) The trouble is, there is no one to make terms with who can be relied
                            upon.</p>
                        <p>(13) Our men are still on shore, having been there two weeks. I would
                            like to get them back on board, but the American residents are so worked
                            up and alarmed lest there should be a Nicaraguan invasion that the men
                            can not well be withdrawn at present, and as our force is small and the
                            complications seem to increase rather than diminish, I sent a dispatch
                            to the Department, via Port Limon, on the 16tb, that another man-of war
                            was required, and as I see no prospect of a settlement, I think one is.
                            A small vessel to enter the river would control the situation, or else a
                            large one with a good-sized crew and plenty of officers, to lay
                            outside.</p>
                        <p>(14) It is generally believed that the Government of Nicaragua will
                            forcibly occupy the reserve as soon as it can do so.</p>
                        <p>(15) There is no particular change in the political situation, and
                            nothing has been done as yet looking toward an adjustment of
                            difficulties.</p>
                        <p>(16) The British man-of-war <hi rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> arrived this
                            morning from Kingston, Jamaica. Her captain had very vague ideas as to
                            what had taken place, but had seen some exaggerated dispatches in the
                            newspapers at Jamacia. He said he had no orders of any kind, and has
                            just gone ou shore to look about for himself. I gave him such
                            information as I had concerning the state of affairs.</p>
                        <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                        <p>(18) An Englishman named Salter was here a couple of days ago from Grey
                            Town, and brought with him a letter from one Rivas, the governor of that
                            place, addressed to “The rioters and revolutionists,” commanding them,
                            in the name of the President of Nicaragua, to disperse, and restore the
                            former order of things, or troops would be sent to punish them, etc.
                            This letter was presented to the Mosquito council, and Mr. Salter was
                            informed that any written questions he might ask would be answered in
                            writing, but he had no questions to ask, and has returned to Grey
                            Town.</p>
                        <p>(19) On the 14th instant, having learned that a boat owned by Americans
                            had been used for military purposes, I had a notice printed for
                            distribution (copy herewith, C). The Mosquito chief addressed me a
                            three-page letter in consequence, to explain that he and his followers
                            were not revolutionists.</p>
                        <p>(20) There has been rioting at Corn Island and some overthrow of
                            officials, but the Nicaraguans are still in power. Six or seven Jamaica
                            negroes concerned in the matter, who claimed to be British subjects,
                            were sent here to the British vice consul, but nobody wanted them here,
                            and they were allowed to depart.</p>

                        <p>(22) What the ultimate outcome of these affairs may be it is impossible
                            for any one down here to predict. The Mosquito Government is and has
                            been inefficient, and, should it continue, it would simply be the tool
                            of influential foreigners, so that it seems to me that the best thing
                            that could happen would be the absorption of the Nicaraguan Government
                            of the Reserve, provided that the vested rights of Americans, secured
                            under the Mosquito Government, should be secured to them by some binding
                            obligation. Otherwise they will be sacrificed. * * *</p>
                        <p>(23) Since writing the foregoing Commander Stewart, of H. M. S. <hi
                                rend="italic">Mohawk</hi>, has been on shore, and called on me on
                            his way back. He told me what I already knew—that a Jamaica negro had
                            gone into the shop of a Chinaman and pointed a gun at him in fun, which
                            the Chinaman took in earnest, and shot and killed the negro. There was
                            much excitement over the affair, and the negroes threatened to lynch the
                            Chinaman, who was lodged in jail.</p>
                        <p>(24) Commander Stewart said that, just as he was leaving shore, the
                            magistrate, who is an American named Wiltbanks, in the employ of the
                            Mosquito faction, told him that the Jamaica negroes, who claimed to be
                            British subjects (but who, in fact, are the disorderly and dangerous
                            element of the Mosquito faction), had threatened to disturb the peace,
                            and evidently some influence was brought to bear to induce Commander
                            Stewart to land some men to keep “British subjects” in order. He said he
                            asked to see some of the men who were conspicuous in the matter, and, on
                            being confronted with them, he told them that if the Chinaman in jail
                            was lynched he would hang the ringleaders in the affair. So far as
                            Commander Stewart is concerned, I am satisfied that he is sincere in his
                            desire not to become entangled with the affairs on shore, of which, as a
                            newcomer, he has but little knowledge; but from what I know of the
                            situation I fully believe that some pretext, even to a riot, if
                            necessary, will be found by the Mosquito faction to get his men on
                            shore, and even if they do nothing, it will be made use of by them to
                            help along the Mosquito cause, as it will stiffen the backbones of the
                            weak among them, who are taught to believe that England is behind
                            them.</p>
                        <p>(25) Commander Stewart told me he was perplexed, and I advised him to
                            form his own opinions after he had been here longer and understood
                            matters, and not let people on shore do it for him. He said he did not
                            wish to do anything that I disapproved of, and I told him that I
                            certainly was not the judge of his actions, nor did I doubt his good
                            faith in the matter, but if I thought at any time that his actions
                            affected the political situation in any way, whether intentionally or
                            unintentionally on his part, I should consider it my duty to report the
                            fact to my Government.</p>
                        <p>(26) Commander Stewart said, finally, that he was going to Grey Town to
                            send dispatches, to-morrow, and would simply leave an officer on shore
                            here to look around and see what the conduct was of the turbulent
                            Jamaica negroes.</p>
                        <p>(27) The arrival of the British ship <hi rend="italic">Mohawk</hi> will
                            have quite an effect upon the Mosquito faction, whose leaders were
                            beginning to waver, but now they will brace up again, and the Nicaraguan
                            commissioner at Rama understands this, for in speaking with me as to the
                            possibility of coming to terms with the people here he remarked that, if
                            done, it ought to be done before the arrival of the British man-of-war,
                            showing that simply the presence of one would affect the situation.</p>
                        <p>(28) I see no urgent reason at the present moment why the British ship
                            should land men, but I can see reasons why the supporters of the
                            Mosquito faction desire to have them landed.</p>
                        <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0173"/>
                        <p>(29) There are no British interests or subjects here except the Jamaica
                            negroes, who form the rank and file of the Mosquito party, as the
                            Indians count for but little except from a sentimental point of view.
                            These negroes are not in need of protection of anybody, unless it should
                            be that the Nicaraguans come to take the place, in which case the
                            British would hardly care to interfere, I imagine.</p>
                        <p>The negroes are an unruly set, and need keeping in order, but I should
                            regard a landing on their account as more of a pretext than a
                            necessity.</p>
                        <p>(30) When our men were landed, on the 6th instant, the Government of this
                            place was in the hands of the Nicaraguan commissioner, who represented
                            the sovereign authority, and the provisional council (of which this same
                            commissioner was president) representing the local authority. I received
                            a written request to land men, from said commissioner, before they were
                            landed.</p>
                        <p>(31) It was but a few hours later on that date (the 6th) that the
                            Mosquito chief issued his proclamation that he had resumed his rightful
                            authority, and it was about noon on the following day that the
                            Nicaraguans withdrew, leaving his faction in control.</p>
                        <p>(32) I have had no communication with the Mosquito party with reference
                            to our men being on shore, but shall now go to them, they having had
                            control for two weeks, and inquire if they can and will guarantee the
                            security of Americans and their property, and see what they have to say,
                            and shall also assemble the leading Americans and see what they have to
                            say.</p>
                        <p>(33) The court-house, which our men occupy, and which is the only
                            suitable place in the settlement, will probably be required for its
                            legitimate use in August, and I should not know where to go if we have
                            to leave it and remain on shore.</p>
                        <p>(34) While we have been located there we have had our ensign hoisted on a
                            staff in front of it, not in any way to supplant the flag of the
                            reserve, which flies from its usual place, and since the Nicaraguan
                            commissioner went to Rama, on the 11th, no Nicaraguan flag has been
                            hoisted. I heard by accident yesterday that some remark had been made as
                            to the propriety of our flag being hoisted at our barracks, but
                            everybody here knows our attitude, and I am sure that no significance
                            has been attached to the fact, but in such a community and at such a
                            time it seemed the proper thing, and no remonstrance was made by the
                            Nicaraguan commissioner, nor, in fact, has any been made by the
                            Mosquitoes.</p>

                            put before you our humble request harem given.</p>
                        <p>In the incidents which took place on July 6 we did not intend in the
                            least to be rebellions to the sovereign Government of Nicaragua.</p>
                        <p>As General Cabezas failed to govern and the place was left without a
                            government, we with one accord requested our deposed chief, Robert Henry
                            Clarence to reassume his legal authority. Our chief, after due
                            consideration, consented, and on being reinstated demanded [of] General
                            Cabezas a turning over of the government into his <pb n="167"
                                xml:id="pg_167" facs="0174"/>hands. This general asked time for
                            consideration, and in the meantime declared that he would “lay the
                            niggers low” with his men and cannon, which he had at the bluff. Some of
                            us, hearing his threats, volunteered to go and capture this bluff,
                            guard, and cannon.</p>
                        <p>Having been successful in our undertaking, the General surrendered,
                            falling short of his expectation. Report has since reached us to the
                            effect that General Cabezas has gone to gather a force of 2,000 strong
                            and to return and utterly destroy us and our properties—we who are only
                            300 in number, know no war tactics, are undisciplined in military
                            organization, and, more than all, wit boat arms and ammunition.</p>
                        <p>Of your mission here we are all well aware—for the protection of the
                            lives and property of American citizens. Now, therefore, we, your humble
                            petitioners, beg that in affording such a protection you will extend the
                            same to us, our families, and properties, if possible. We are conscious
                            of the nature of your petition, but, as we have said, we are utterly
                            unable to withstand the threatened invasion. We beg to subscribe

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In a recent dispatch the United States
                        minister at Managua reports a conversation had with the minister of foreign
                        relations, in which Senor Madriz seemed to be imbued with the idea that
                        citizens of the United States were at the bottom of the trouble at
                        Bluefields; and Mr. Baker adds that the assistant secretary, Señor Roman
                        Mayorga Rivas,“announced the purpose of the Government to take down 1,000
                        troops and four cannon and butcher all the Americans in that territory if
                        necessary to establish and maintain Nicaraguan rule there.”</p>
                    <p>In my frequent conferences with you concerning the state of things in the
                        Mosquito Reservation, I have had occasion to inform you that the advices
                        received by this Government show that the citizens of the United States in
                        Bluefields and vicinity, acting under the wise counsel of our diplomatic,
                        consular, and naval representatives in that quarter, have, as a class,
                        maintained an attitude of neutrality and submission to the authorities.
                        These advices are repeated and confirmed by the latest reports of the United
                        States naval commanders in Nicaraguan waters, which make it clear that but a
                        few, perhaps three, Americans at Bluefields took part in the recent uprising
                        in behalf of the so-called Indian government, and that these were men of
                        little or no standing in the community.</p>
                    <p>The pain the President feels on learning of the prepossessions of the
                        minister of foreign affairs is allayed by the belief that on his present
                        visit to the reservation as the authoritative agent of his Government, the
                        true position of the great mass of the Americans resident there can, not
                        fail to be apparent to him, and that the unjust impression he seems to have
                        with regard to them will be speedily dispelled.</p>
                    <p>I can not, of course, suppose that the extraordinary utterances attributed to
                        the assistant secretary of foreign affairs represent the sentiments of your
                        Government, which has of late had too abundant evidence of the good will of
                        the United States toward Nicaragua and too certain proof of our purpose to
                        recognize and respect the sovereign rights of the Republic over all its
                        territory, to allow of its harboring so unfriendly and biased a view as Mr.
                        Mayorga Rivas appears to hold.</p>
                    <p>The naval force of the United States at Bluefields is charged with the duty
                        of protecting American citizens there in the peaceable enjoyment of their
                        legitimate rights of person and property. The commanding <pb n="169"
                            xml:id="pg_169" facs="0176"/>officers will doubtless counsel their
                        absolute neutrality in the present deplorable state of affairs and due
                        regard for the paramount sovereignty of Nicaragua over that region.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have had the honor to receive your
                        excellency’s appreciable communication of to-day’s date, the original of
                        which I am about to send to my Government for its consideration.</p>
                    <p>The Nicaraguan authorities in Mosquitia informed my Government that several
                        American citizens had taken part in the seditious movement which lately
                        occurred in the city of Bluefields, and it is probable that this is what the
                        minister of foreign relations referred to in his conversation with the
                        Honorable Mr. Baker. Dr. Madriz is thoroughly acquainted with the affairs of
                        the reserve, since he has studied them on the very theater of events, and
                        being, as he is, an intelligent, upright, and judicious observer, I am sure
                        that he will know how to estimate things at their just worth.</p>
                    <p>As for the expressions uttered, as Mr. Baker assures you, by the
                        sub-secretary of foreign affairs of Nicaragua, Señor Don Roman Mayorga
                        Rivas, I can do no less than believe that there has been in this incident
                        some misunderstanding, since it appears to me from every point of view
                        unlikely that an official of the rank and responsibility of Senor Mayorga
                        should have expressed himself in such wise, the more so knowing the
                        sentiments which animate the Government of Nicaragua, not only toward the
                        American element of Mosquitia in general, but also with respect to those
                        citizens of the United States who unfortunately took active part in the
                        rebellion. I have already had the honor to bring to your excellency’s
                        knowledge the reply which the President of Nicaragua made to the cablegram
                        sent to him by Minister Barrios and myself on the 15th instant. Therein are
                        palpably evidenced the friendly sentiments wherewith General Zelaya is
                        animated with respect to the Government and people of the United States,
                        such being a natural consequence of the repeated proofs of friendship and
                        sympathy which Nicaragua has received at all times from this great
                        nation.</p>
                    <p>As the representative of Nicaragua in this country, I can assure your
                        excellency that the words attributed to Señor Mayorga liivas do not in any
                        manner interpret the feelings of my Government relative to the American
                        citizens residing in Mosquitia, since, far from the slightest prepossession
                        against them existing, they have ever been regarded as an element useful to
                        the development of that region, and have been treated with the greatest
                        consideration, being offered without reserve the ample and proverbial
                        hospitality which distinguishes the Nicaraguan people.</p>
                    <p>I would be grateful to your excellency if you would be pleased to bring what
                        I have stated to the high knowledge of His Excellency the President of the
                        United States, and I have, etc.,</p>

                        the British position in respect to the Mosquito Reservation, has been
                        received.</p>
                    <p>The declarations of Lord Kimberley, touching the instructions under which the
                        British naval and consular representatives are acting in that quarter, agree
                        with the statements made by Captain Stewart of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >Magicienne</hi> and by Vice-Consul Hatch to our naval commander. This
                        wise policy, if continued, will, the President believes, promote a
                        settlement of the troubles not inconsistent with the sovereign rights of
                        Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p>Your comments upon the situation show that the reliance of the Department
                        upon your intimate knowledge of the question has not been misplaced. You
                        rightly interpret the purpose of this Government to confine its protection
                        of American citizens and enterprises in that quarter to such interests as
                        may be legitimately established there.</p>
                    <p>As you have already been advised, a Nicaraguan envoy is now on his way to

                        night, 6 p.m., off Grey Town. Captain Stuart came immediately on shore and
                        had an interview with General Reyes, visited the prisoners, and called on
                        me. He sails back to Port Limon, expecting to find instructions concerning
                        the offensive policy recently developed by the Nicaraguan officials against
                        the British representatives. The Bluefields proconsul being arrested, and no
                        navy officer accepted to perform the consular service, Dr. J. Johnstone, new
                        appointed consul for Nicaragua, resident at San Juan del Norte, has also
                        been declared to be ignored, and so there is de facto not one British
                        consular representation along the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. The fourteen
                        prisoners will to-morrow be taken to Managua.</p>

                        the recent disturbances at Bluefields, has been received and its contents
                        noted.</p>
                    <p>It has been a source of deep regret to me that illness, coupled with the
                        abominable mail and telegraphic service, have prevented my more promptly
                        transmitting to the Department full advices as to the affairs transpiring in
                        Mosquitia, but, as I have just learned through Consul S. C. Braida, of San
                        Juan del Norte, that several American citizens were arrested at Bluefields,
                        under orders from Special Commissioner Madriz, and are now being transported
                        to this capital, I will, no doubt, be able to render more valuable service
                        here than if I were in Bluefields.</p>
                    <p>Through the medium of conversations with the President of Nicaragua I think
                        that I have been of some use in this affair, while the powerful naval force
                        of the United States now on the Mosquito coast is much more able to enforce
                        any demands that should be made than I am.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the morning of the 16th of August two
                        citizens of the United States and twelve subjects of Great Britain, all
                        residents of Bluefields, Nicaragua, were placed under arrest by order of
                        Commissioner Madriz and sent immediately to Managua, without any opportunity
                        to arrange any of their business or family affairs or to make any other
                        preparations for their enforced journey or their comfort. They arrived at
                        this place last evening, after twelve days of most disagreeable travel. They
                        were in charge of General Reyes. I promptly called upon the General and upon
                        the prisoners after their arrival. At my request the General kindly
                        permitted me to take the two Americans to my house for the evening. The
                        names of these gentlemen are J. S. Lampton and George B. Wiltbank. No
                        charges have been made against any of the persons under arrest.</p>
                    <p>Of the two Americans, I believe it can truthfully be said that they have
                        neither of them been unfriendly, by word or deed, to the Government of
                        Nicaragua.mr. Wiltbank accepted the position of magistrate to act during the
                        time that the functions of the Nicaraguan Government were suspended at
                        Bluefields in July last, and Mr. Lampton acted as a member of the council
                        formed during the same interregnum. Both of these men were urged to accept
                        these respective positions by the business men of the place, and their
                        acceptance met the approval of Commander O’Neil, of the U. S. S. <hi

                        positions they did not, either officially or unofficially, so they affirm,
                        perform any act detrimental to the sovereignty or dignity of the supreme
                        Government of Nicaragua, their official acts being confined to a
                        preservation of the peace in the town and the promotion of the local
                        business interests.</p>
                    <p>Having had a full consultation with these men, I will see the President in

                    <p>The names of the British subjects here under arrest follow:</p>
                    <p>E. D. Hatch, Her Britannic Majesty’s vice-consul at Bluefields; W. H. Brown,

                        Glover, S. Hodgson, George Hodgson, J. W. Cuthbert, attorney-general and
                        chief adviser of the Mosquito chief, and Charles Patterson, the late
                        vice-president of the Mosquito Government.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that in the list of prisoners the names of the
                        vice-president and of the attorney-general and chief adviser of Chief
                        Clarence appear. Chief Clarence was taken by the British man-of-war to

                        <p>P. S.—As I was about to mail the above my morning papers arrived
                            announcing that Messrs. Lampton and Wiltbank are to be expelled from the
                            country. Thinking that they might be sent this morning on the ship now
                            due, I promptly addressed the inclosed statement and protest to the
                            President.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. President</hi>: I observe it stated in a morning
                            paper that Messrs. J. S, Lampton and George B. Wiltbank, together with
                            several other residents of Blueflelds, were arrested and brought to this
                            city as prisoners for active participation in the outbreak in the
                            Mosquito Reserve in July. It is also stated that your excellency has
                            decreed that these two men, with others, are to be exiled from the
                            country. Messrs. Lampton and Wiltbank are citizens of the United States.
                            They deny that they participated in any way in the movement to overthrow
                            the supremacy of Nicaragua in July last, or at any other time. They
                            claim that their every movement during the time was intended to restore
                            peace and preserve the business interests of the country.</p>
                        <p>But, Mr. President, should they be shown to be mistaken in this, the
                            constitution of Nicaragua, if I read it correctly, guarantees to them a
                            reasonable time in which to wind up their business affairs.</p>
                        <p>If the announcement that these men are to be expelled from the country is
                            correct, and if it is the intention to send them at once in the face of
                            this guarantee, I must, in the name of the Government of the United
                            States, whose citizens they are, enter my respectful but most earnest
                            protest. I ask that they be given a reasonable time in which to dispose
                            of their business interests.</p>

                    <p>The President is pained to learn, through reports of naval commander, that
                        American citizens at Blueflelds who, on invitation, visited the
                        commissioner, were arbitrarily seized, denied permission to see families and

                        protests against this lawless proceeding have been ignored, Such arrest,
                        besides violating treaty of 1887, is an ungenerous response to the friendly
                        disposition recently manifested by this Government respecting the
                        sovereignty of Nicaragua over the Mosquito territory. You will demand

                        by treaty, and in default thereof their release.</p>

                    <p>I may here remark that Messrs. Lampton and Wiltbank, the two Americans who
                        were brought to Managua, and afterwards sent out of the country without
                        trial, were not aware that the United States naval commander had made any
                        protest against their arbitrary arrest, treatment, and expulsion. The
                        commander sent no word of information to me, and I was left with the
                        inference that our commander knew that these men were guilty of fomenting
                        trouble and should be sent out of the country. This seeming action, or want
                        of action, on the part of the commander made it the more difficult for me to
                        know how much I should demand.</p>
                    <p>Besides, having in view the fact that I made a “demand” in the Argiiello case

                        Government and apparently dropped by ours, I tried in this case to be
                        especially judicious and to not protest too vigorously.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: On the 28th instant I had the
                            unpleasant duty of presenting, in the name of the Government of the
                            United States, a firm protest against the proceedings taken by the
                            Government of Nicaragua in the arbitrary arrest and expulsion from this
                            country, without trial and without previous notice, of two American
                            citizens who are engaged in business in Bluefields. Tour answer,
                            received on the afternoon of the same day, asserted that these men were
                            guilty of high crimes against this Government. If this is true it is
                            susceptible of proof. In my note I appealed to your own constitution for
                            their protection; and I now respectfully represent that your action in
                            hastily expelling these men is in direct violation of your treaty with
                            the United States of 1867.</p>
                        <p>I am instructed by the President of the United States to say to you that
                            he “is pained to learn that American citizens at Bluefields, who, on
                            invitation, visited the commissioner, were arbitrarily seized, denied
                            permission to see their families and friends, and forcibly taken to
                            Managua to answer unknown charges, and that protests of our naval
                            representative against this unlawful proceeding have been ignored. Such
                            arrest, besides violating the treaty of 1867, is an ungenerous response
                            to the friendly disposition recently manifested by this Government
                            respecting the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the Mosquito
                            territory.”</p>
                        <p>And the President adds in his instruction to me: “You will demand
                            immediate, open trial of the accused, with all guarantees of defense
                            secured by treaty, and in default thereof, their prompt release.”</p>

                            mercy of the foreigners. Even the American consul there was ready to
                            pull down his flag and give up his commission as an empty fraud which
                            afforded no protection to his people.”</p>
                        <p>All of which is false, and a slander not only upon the American naval
                            officers and myself, but upon the better class of the Americans who
                            reside in Bluefields. The name of the author is not given, but it is
                            clear from the date of the article that it was written by a nonresident
                            who has no interest here, and who would sneakingly give a stab to his
                            countrymen to gratify perhaps imagined grievance of his own.</p>
                        <p>This article was dated Mobile, August 15, 1894, and, like many of its
                            predecessors, was anonymous and apparently written with a reckless
                            disregard of truth and calculated to create a sensation abroad. Ever
                            since the local troubles began strangers have been dropping into this
                            town and disappearing again in a few days, and then follow in the papers
                            long articles distorting the facts and entailing injury upon the people
                            they so wantonly calumniate.</p>
                        <p>I am surprised that a newspaper of any standing will open its columns to
                            these unknown correspondents, who, for all they know, may have secret
                            and dishonest motives in writing such articles. You will see the article
                            referred to in the New Orleans Times-Democrat of the 17th, and is dated
                            Mobile, August 15, 1894.</p>

                                    <persName type="to">Sumner</persName>.</hi></head>
                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Captain</hi>: In conformity with your request I
                            have the honor to report herewith that the town of Bluefields has been
                            unusually quiet during the past week. I am not officially informed of
                            what has been transpiring at the headquarters of Minister Madriz since
                            the recent occupation by the Nicaraguan forces.</p>
                        <p>I am told, however, that some sort of an investigation has been going on,
                            apparently with the view of identifying American residents of Bluefields
                            with the uprising on the nights of the 5th and 6th of July. According to
                            reports some mercantile firms have been charged with selling arms and
                            ammunition to the natives, but thus far they have not succeeded in
                            fixing upon any of said firms any criminal intent in selling firearms to
                            the natives. All the merchants are licensed to sell general merchandise,
                            and under such license they have for a number of years been importing
                            large quantities of firearms and selling same to miners, rubber cutters,
                            and others who go into the jungles. If the law makes no special
                            prohibition against the sale of firearms, no criminal intent is to be
                            inferred from the fact of such sale.</p>
                        <p>I do not imagine that anyone would be adjudged guilty of an offense upon
                            a mere ex parte hearing, or that a trial would be conducted secretly
                            without giving the defendant an opportunity of being confronted with the
                            witnesses against him and to make his defense either by himself or by
                            his attorney. For these reasons I presume the present investigation is
                            being conducted as a court of inquiry having powers, duties, aims, and
                            purposes similar to those of our grand juries in the United States.</p>
                        <p>The man Juan Soto was before the magistrate Mougrio yesterday. I do not
                            know if an investigation was made by Mougrio yesterday or not. I
                            presume, however, that he has not completed such investigation, if he
                            has commenced it at all. Mougrio stated yesterday that the main witness
                            had gone up the river to Kama. I send you an affidavit made before me
                            yesterday by a woman who lives here in Bluefields.</p>
                        <p>We have Nicaraguan soldiers with rifles and bayonets passing about
                            through the streets, but they do not challenge anyone and seem to be
                            very quiet and orderly. Martial law still obtains, and some of the
                            merchants are considerably exercised over the fact, as the existence of
                            martial law suspends the liability of insurance companies and thereby
                            exposes the merchants to great loss in case of accident.</p>

                            <p>P. S. I am just informed that Mougrio tried the case of Juan Soto
                                to-day, and that he adjudged him guilty of a breach of the peace and
                                sentenced him to twenty-five days’ imprisonment and requires a bond
                                in the sum of $100 to keep the peace tor one year. In the meantime
                                the Mexican one, Pedro Diaz, has been kept in close confinement
                                under the operation of martial law since about the 6th instant
                                without a trial.</p>
                            <p>Respectfully,</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my dispatch of the date of August 28, I
                        informed you of the probable expulsion from Nicaragua, without trial or
                        opportunity to be heard and without time to arrange their business affairs,
                        of two citizens of the United States, lately residents of Bluefields, viz,
                        J. S. Lampton and George B. Wiltbank. I inclosed in that dispatch a copy of
                        a protest which I hastily addressed to the President (as dictatorial powers
                        had been conferred upon him, and the decree of the expulsion had been issued
                        by him).</p>
                    <p>At 11 o’clock on the same morning the prisoners named in my dispatch were
                        sent to Oorinto and placed upon a ship the same evening. It was understood
                        that they would be landed at Punta Arenas, Costa Rica. Their purpose, I
                        understand, was to go from there to Port Limon, and later to the States.
                        About two hours after the prisoners were sent away I received from the state
                        departmentehere the inclosed answer to my protest.</p>
                    <p>If Messrs. Lampton and Wiltbank were “chief promoters of the disturbances,”
                        and “disturbers” and “revolters,” as therein characterized, I have been
                        misinformed. But if this was true, as charged, it was easily susceptible of
                        proof; and proof rather than unsupported assertion would be more
                        desirable.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The President of the Republic has honored
                            me with the duty of answering Your Excellency’s communication of this
                            date, which has just been received.</p>
                        <p>The article contained in a newspaper of this morning is correct in saying
                            that Messrs, J. S. Lampton, George B. Wiltbank, and other foreigners who
                            resided in Bluefields, will be expelled from the territory of the
                            Republic, it having resulted from the investigations that they were very
                            much compromised in the crimes of rebellion and sedition perpetrated in
                            the Mosquito Reserve during the first part of July last.</p>
                        <p>The President is pained at not being able to grant Your Excellency’s
                            request that sufficient time he allowed the said persons to arrange
                            their <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0186"/>business affairs, because
                            they are only in this city en route, and it would not be possible to
                            permit them to return to Bluefields, where they have established their
                            business, because there they are the cause of disturbance and constant
                            in tranquillity, for which reasons they have been forced to leave that
                            place.</p>
                        <p>The constitution of the Republic, Mr. Minister, does not guarantee to
                            foreigners a fixed time in which to arrange their private affairs when
                            they are expelled from the country; such regulations are left to the
                            statute laws, which have not yet been promulgated; and the measure of
                            which we treat being purely one of police, to prevent further uprisings
                            against the public order on the Atlantic Coast, is of an urgent
                            character and does not admit of delay.</p>
                        <p>Permit me to call your excellency’s attention to the inconvenience and
                            danger that would be caused by allowing the chief promoters of the
                            disorders which occurred to return to Bluefields even for a short time,
                            as they had sufficient time to arrange their business before leaving the
                            Mosquito Reserve.</p>
                        <p>The Government, Mr. Minister, is unavoidably in duty bound to procure the
                            interior secure [security?] of the State and to have its sovereignty
                            respected; and notwithstanding that the full rigor of the military law
                            could have been applied to the disturbers for their acts, out of
                            consideration and sentiments of humanity toward the nations to which the
                            revolters belong, the Government limited itself to dictate a preventive
                            measure of a political character in use of extraordinary faculties.</p>
                        <p>With expressions of consideration of my particular esteem for Tour
                            Excellency, I have the honor to subscribe myself your very obedient

                    <p>After three days’ delay in acknowledging my communication delivered under
                        your instructions, by cable, August 29, the Government of Nicaragua refuses
                        to accede to your demand that prisoners be given trial. They contend that
                        they are not bound to give them trial by either the treaty of 1867 or by the
                        laws of Nicaragua. * * *</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The story of the arrest and banishment of
                        Messrs. J. S. Lampton and G. W. Wiltbank, the two American citizens residing
                        and doing business at Bluefields, is briefly as follows:</p>
                    <p>On the 16th of August a messenger called upon each of these men <pb n="180"
                            xml:id="pg_180" facs="0187"/>separately, at his place of business, and
                        verbally informed him that the commissioner, Jose Madriz, desired to see
                        him, and politely inquired if he would be good enough to call at the
                        former’s office. Of course, each gentleman answered in the affirmative, and
                        at once, laying aside all other duties, made the call. They were ushered
                        into an office, but not into the presence of the commissioner. The officer
                        in charge informed them that they were prisoners. This announcement
                        naturally caused them great surprise. They inquired upon what charges the
                        arrest was based. No information was given in response. After exhausting
                        every endeavor to gain this important information, and to see the
                        commissioner in person, without avail, and finding that they were certainly
                        to be sent to Managua without being enlightened as to the cause, they
                        addressed themselves to an effort to gain permission to return to their
                        places of business and residences for a few hours to prepare for their trip.
                        No argument or expostulation could gain the granting of this reasonable and
                        just request.</p>
                    <p>Then application was made to permit business associates or members of their
                        families to visit them, in order that they might give some directions about
                        their business and domestic affairs. This most reasonable request was
                        shamelessly and brutally denied to them. Neither were they permitted to have
                        a particle of food during the entire day, nor were they furnished with any
                        sort of bed to lie upon that night. At a late hour friends succeeded in
                        sending to them some blankets and a change of clothing before they were
                        taken away.</p>
                    <p>The prisoners represent that the trip, occupying the succeedingtwelve days,
                        was in every respect as uncomfortable as can be imagined. They were herded
                        with a strong guard, numbering about 250, of as filthy apologies for
                        soldiers as ever shouldered muskets, and sometimes the stench about them was
                        sickening in the extreme. The eating was in keeping with the filthy and
                        nauseous surroundings.</p>
                    <p>Arriving on the evening of the 27th at Managua, the prisoners were marched
                        from the railroad station to the palace, where the President informed them
                        that he would look over his telegrams that night and would send for them
                        next morning. On their petition and that of their friends they were
                        permitted to spend the night in the hotel at their own expense instead of in
                        the prison, which latter is a wretched, filthy place, from all accounts I
                        have had of it.</p>
                    <p>The next morning, between 9 and 10 o’clock, the prisoners were all—for there
                        were fourteen, two Americans and twelve British—notified to get ready to go
                        to the palace. After washing and brushing up and announcing their readiness
                        to go, word was whispered into the ears of some of them that perhaps it
                        would be as well if they would take their baggage with them. This was
                        hastily packed up, and they were marched directly to the steamboat landing,
                        under armed guards, and carried, without any chance whatever to be heard in
                        their own behalf, out of the country.</p>
                    <p>The evening of the arrival of the prisoners in Managua the two Americans
                        spent at my house, and they gave me the above information. They also told me
                        that the few Americans at Bluefields who were conscions of having committed
                        any unlawful acts against the sovereign Government had left the country of
                        their own accord, and they had remained in the fall consciousness of having
                        contributed all in their power toward the preservation of the peace.</p>
                    <p>On the following morning the little newspaper edited by Mr. José D. Gamez
                        contained an item intimating that a portion of the prisoners, including the
                        two Americans, would be banished from the <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181"
                            facs="0188"/>country. It did not say when this would be done. But I lost
                        not one moment in addressing a hasty note to the President (see inclosure in
                        my No. 375), earnestly protesting against the banishment of Messrs. Lampton
                        and Wiltbank without an opportunity being given them to return to their
                        homes and putting their business in order, and an impartial trial being
                        secured to them. No attention was paid to this protest until after the
                        prisoners had been sent on their way.</p>
                    <p>The reply of this Government was to the effect that it would be dangerous to
                        the peace of the country to permit these “chief promoters of the disorders”
                        to return to Bluefields even for a short time, and that the prisoners had
                        had ample time to put their business affairs in order before leaving. (See
                        inclosure in my No. 377.)</p>
                    <p>On the night of the 29th I received your cable of that date, instructing me
                        to “demand immediate open trial of the accused, with all guarantees of
                        defense secured by treaty; and in default thereof, their release.”</p>
                    <p>At an early hour on the morning of the 30th I presented your demand, in the
                        name of the President of the United States. (See inclosure in my No.
                        378.)</p>
                    <p>At 6 o’clock on the evening of September 1, three days having elapsed, the
                        answer was delivered at the legation. In this the Nicaraguan Government
                        takes the altogether untenable position that neither the treaty of 1867 nor
                        their own laws require them to give trial to the accused. They point to the
                        fact that they do not give trial to their own citizens, and argue that
                        American citizens can not claim better treatment at the hands of the
                        Government than they give to their own. This communication I did not
                        answer.</p>
                    <p>So the matter stands to-day.</p>
                    <p>I have, etc.,</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: I have had the honor of receiving
                            Your Excellency’s communication of yesterday, in which you remind me
                            that on the 28th instant Your Excellency entered a protest against the
                            proceedings of my Government in the arbitrary arrest and expulsion from
                            this country, without previous notice or trial, of American citizens who
                            were engaged in business at Bluefields. Your Excellency states that on
                            the same day you received my reply in which I informed you that the
                            Government adopted such proceedings against those parties because they
                            had been implicated hi the uprisings which occurred in the Mosquito
                            Reserve, and you say that if such is the case, it is susceptible of
                            proof. Your excellency also reminds ine of having called my attention to
                            the protection guaranteed to foreigners by our constitution (ley
                            fundamental), and add that you must now respectfully protest against the
                            expulsion already effected, which you characterize as an act of
                            hostility, and hold to be in direct violation of our treaty with the
                            United States of 1867.</p>
                        <p>In continuing, Your Excellency transmits to me your instructions from the
                            President of the United States. In them it is affirmed that <pb n="182"
                                xml:id="pg_182" facs="0189"/>he has been pained to learn that
                            American citizens residing at Blue-fields were suddenly and arbitrarily
                            arrested without permitting them to see their families and friends, and
                            were forcibly taken to Managua to answer charges; that in spite of the
                            protests of the American naval agents, the proceedings were continued,
                            ignoring the motives which occasioned them; that this arrest is in
                            violation of the treaty of 1867, and is far from being a generous
                            response to the friendly disposition recently manifested by the United
                            States Government respecting the sovereignty of Nicaragua over the
                            Mosquito territory; and in conclusion the President demands (pide).that
                            the accused be tried with all guarantees of defense secured by the
                            treaty existing between the two countries, and in default of this, their
                            immediate release.</p>
                        <p>The measure, Mr. Minister, which my Government dictated on the 28th
                            instant, is purely political and of high police, adopted to maintain
                            public security, by expelling from the country certain disturbing
                            elements, pernicious in the present circumstances of the Republic.
                            According to that measure a previous trial, with all the formalities of
                            the law, is not required, but certain investigations to prove the
                            responsibility of the persons suspected are enough to justify the
                            proceeding. This is based upon the laws of July 21, and the 18th of
                            August, passed by the National Assembly, with the object of effecting
                            our sovereignty over the Atlantic Coast, of maintaining it throughout
                            the country, and of assuring the public tranquillity.</p>
                        <p>In the second article of the former law the Executive is authorized to
                            adopt such measures as he may judge convenient, with the said object,
                            and in article 3 the mode of procedure is set forth. The law of the 18th
                            instant provides that in case of crimes against the peace and public
                            security the Executive shall proceed administratively
                            (gubernativamente); and, as in matters of legal proceedings the laws are
                            retroactive, so this latter law could have been applied to the parties
                            implicated in the Bluefields rebellion.</p>
                        <p>My Government does not think that the resolution of the 28th instant is
                            in violation of the treaty of 1867, existing between Nicaragua and the
                            United States of America. An equality of guarantees and proceedings is
                            insured by said convention to Nicaraguans and Americans, and that
                            equality has been maintained in this case; in fact, on the 1st instant,
                            that same law was applied to certain citizens of this Republic, among
                            whom were some high ecclesiastical dignitaries, in exactly the same
                            manner as was applied nine days later to the sons of the great American
                            Republic. These persons have, therefore, been treated the same as
                            Nicaraguans under equal circumstances.</p>
                        <p>I must call your excellency’s attention to the fact that the prisoners
                            were treated with the greatest consideration, having enjoyed all of the
                            commodities offered by our country; en route they were in comparative
                            liberty, having had no other escort than the aides de-camp of the
                            general in chief; they were lodged at the principal hotels; their
                            first-class passage was paid on the railroads and steamers. In this
                            capital the President gave them an audience, during which they were
                            unable to refute the charges brought against them, because the part they
                            took in these affairs is undeniable.</p>
                        <p>Your excellency says that if the responsibilities incurred by Messrs. J.
                            S. Lampton and George B. Wiltbank are true, it is susceptible of proof.
                            Nothing is more evident, Mr. Minister. It will suffice for me to tell
                            your excellency that the former served on the council born of the
                            Bluefields rebellion, and the latter acted as magistrate of the same,
                            thus assuming all the responsibilities incurred by the rebels against
                                <pb n="183" xml:id="pg_183" facs="0190"/>the Government of Nicaragua
                            for the attempts against its sovereignty on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of
                            last July, and for all other acts of the rebellion. On the 5th of the
                            said month the rebels attacked the commissioner’s palace; on the 6th
                            they dragged our flag through the streets of the city, and on the 7th
                            they assaulted with perfidy our small garrison on the bluff, taking
                            possession of its firms and killing in an unjustifiable manner several
                            of our soldiers. At Corn Island, also, they fired on the Nicaraguan
                            authorities, wounding the secretary of the chief of police and burning
                            the police building.</p>
                        <p>And the responsibility for all these acts rests upon Messrs. Lampton and
                            Wiltbank, as they were members of the rebels, as well as upon the other
                            participants of the rebellion. Those acts are public and notorious, they
                            were witnessed by the city of Bluefields, they happened in sight of the
                            American ship <hi rend="italic">Marblehead</hi>, and the press
                            universally has published accounts of them, and they have been verified
                            by Dr. José Madriz, special commissioner of the Government to the
                            Mosquito Reserve, in his investigations, which resulted in his obtaining
                            evidence so clear and truthful that my Government will not hesitate to
                            present it to the Government of the United States, that it may judge for
                            itself and acknowledge the soundness of the motives for this
                            Government’s actions. To that end it will send a copy of the evidence
                            directly to the Cabinet at Washington through our minister, Dr.
                            Guzman.</p>
                        <p>As an eloquent testimony of the moderation with which this Government has
                            acted in dealing with the rebels against the peace of the Republic I
                            must call your excellency’s attention to the fact that if they had been
                            tried according to the ordinary laws the tribunals would have applied to
                            them the most vigorous penalties of the military ordinances; but that
                            was avoided by resorting to the law of August 18 and dictating a more
                            benignant measure and one of a purely political character, and the
                            Government has carried its impartiality so far that the persons against
                            whom less serious charges were brought have only been confined in the
                            interior of the country.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Minister, the Government of Nicaragua does not think that in acting
                            in conformity with the laws as it has done, and in treating the American
                            citizens as Nicaraguans according to the manner in which they have been
                            treated, the Government of the United States pan complain that mine has
                            not reciprocated the friendly feeling which the former has always shown
                            in upholding our sovereignty over Mosquitia; on the contrary, it is the
                            belief of my Government that the United States Government is obliged, in
                            this case more than in any other, to do Nicaragua justice, because it
                            has never doubted oar rights on the Atlantic coast, but has protected
                            them by the Monroe doctrine, which is the protection of the American
                            nations; has supported them in memorable treaties, and has defended our
                            rights in bright pleadings of its Cabinet; and consequently it can not
                            but now acknowledge the sovereign act exercised by Nicaragua in having
                            ordered the expulsion from its territory of those who disturbed the
                            peace of the Republic by pretending to deny its sovereignty over a very
                            important portion of our soil.</p>
                        <p>My Government would have acted with remarkable injustice if in expelling
                            from the country the English subjects who were the promoters and leaders
                            of the Mosquito rebellion it had not done likewise to some of their
                            accomplices, on the ground that they were the sons of a friendly
                            republic, as is the United States of America, to which we are united,
                            not only by the fraternal ties of sympathy, but by the common interest
                            of the continent and those created by the grand enterprise of the
                            inter-oceanic canal.</p>
                        <pb n="184" xml:id="pg_184" facs="0191"/>
                        <p>My Government is confident, Mr. Minister, that these explanations will be
                            sufficient to justify its proceedings against Messrs. Lampton and
                            Wiltbank, and to dispel whatever bad impression such proceedings may
                            have created; and, above all, this is no case to be taken as an act of
                            hostility toward the great American nation which you represent among us,
                            and with which we are happily united by the ties of friendship,
                            interest, and family.</p>
                        <p>With all consideration and my highest expression of esteem for your
                            excellency, I have the honor to subscribe myself your very obedient

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: In my official dispatch dated July 27, the
                        following paragraph occurs: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>I had a talk with Dr. Madriz tins morning and I find his mind filled
                                with the idea that the Americans are at the bottom of the trouble at
                                Bluefields; and his assistant secretary, Roman Mayorga Rivas, more
                                frank than discreet, announced the purpose of the Government to take
                                down 1,000 troops and 4 cannon, and to butcher ah the Americans in
                                that territory if necessary to establish and maintain Nicaraguan
                                rule there.</p>
                        </quote></p>
                    <p>Mr. Mayorga has informed me that Minister Guzman writes from Washington that
                        he (Mayorga) made use of this language to me. While this is not exactly the
                        case, he has now admitted to me that he did make use of substantially this
                        language 4o my informants, but that he was in fun. Mr. H. C. Emery, of
                        Boston, first informed me of this man’s talk, I was so astounded that I
                        requested Mr. Emery to see Mr. Mayorga and call his attention to the
                        expression reported to have been used by him. Mr. Emery did so, and
                        afterwards called upon me and said that Mr. Mayorga repeated to him almost
                        the identical expression.</p>
                    <p>The words were first used by Mr. Mayorga while in conversation with Mr. P. W.
                        Chamberlain, a reputable American citizen and correspondent of the New York
                        Herald. It was afterwards repeated, in substance, to Mr. H. C. Emery, of the
                        mahogany firm of that name, Boston, Mass.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mayorga has since been relieved of his official position and is now in
                        private life; He had always claimed to be an especially good friend of
                        Americans, and I was astounded to hear of his use of the intemperate
                        language attributed to him.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>; The American citizens, Lampton and Wiltbank,
                        were, as I told your excellency, expelled from Nicaragua because they took
                        part in the revolutionary movement against the lawful authority, ignored the
                            <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0192"/>sovereignty of the Republic
                        over Mosquitia and supported the so-called government of Robert Henry
                        Clarence.</p>
                    <p>It is true that under the treaty concluded June 21, 1867. between Nicaragua
                        and the United States, Messrs. Lampton and Wiltbank had the right to reside
                        in the Nicaraguan territory and there to pursue their business in full
                        security and safety, but they forfeited their right from the very fact that
                        they took part in an armed rebellion against a nation that had admitted them
                        in her midst. From the time when they placed themselves in such an attitude
                        they made themselves dangerous persons for the public peace, and they are
                        without any right to claim protection in accordance with the above-mentioned
                        treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States maintains its right to exclude from
                        American territory all persons deemed by it to endanger the welfare and
                        peace of the country, and this powerful Republic has too great a sense of
                        justice to deny to other nations that which she claims for herself.</p>
                    <p>If Messrs, Lampton and Wiltbanks wish to return to Bluefields for a
                        reasonable period for the purpose of there arranging their affairs and
                        disposing of their property, should they hold any, let them address to my
                        Government a petition to that effect, and their request will be granted
                        without delay, for nothing affords more gratification to Nicaragua than an
                        opportunity to demonstrate the friendly feelings by which it is animated
                        toward the Government and the people of the United States.</p>

                        <p>This day, before me, the undersigned authority, personally came and
                            appeared Norman L. Latson, to me known, and on his oath declares that
                            heretofore, to wit, on or about the 3d day of August, 1894, affiant was
                            purser on board the American steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>,
                            which arrived off Bluefields on the 3d day of August, 1894, having on
                            board five hundred or thereabouts Nicaraguan soldiers and officials,
                            among whom were Mr. José Madriz, Nicaraguan minister of foreign affairs,
                            General Porto-carrero, judge-advocate, and Carlos Lacayo,
                            ex-commissioner of the Mosquito Reserve. Affiant further states that
                            upon approaching the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Columbia</hi>, which was
                            at anchor off Bluefields, the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>
                            signaled that he had on board the above-mentioned troops and soldiers,
                            under protest.</p>
                        <p>He was thereupon ordered by the U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Columbia</hi>
                            to anchor alongside, and was shortly afterward boarded by Lieut, O. W.
                            Lowry, of said vessel. Lieutenant Lowry refused to allow the captain of
                            the steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi> to disembark the Nicaraguan
                            troops aboard until he had communicated with Captain Sumner, of the
                            steamship <hi rend="italic">Columbia</hi>, who was in the town of
                            Bluefields. He directed Captain Johnson to take the steamship <hi
                                rend="italic">Yulu</hi> into the harbor of Bluefields and to, come
                            to an anchor there. Lieutenant Lowry also placed aboard the steamship
                                <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi> a boat’s crew of eleven men, in charge
                            of Ensign Kuenzli, who was to prevent the disembarkation of the
                            Nicaraguan troops until the return of Lieutenant Lowry, who went into
                            the town in the steam launch of the <hi rend="italic">Columbia</hi> to
                            receive instructions from Captain Sumner. Lieutenant Lowry offered to
                            convey Minister Madriz and any of his officers into the town in his
                            steam launch, but the proffered offer was refused, whereupon Lieutenant
                            Lowry stated that he would return with Captain Sumner’s answer in the
                            shortest possible time—probably two hours.</p>
                        <p>Affiant further states that the Nicaraguan officials were very indignant
                            at the refusal to allow them to disembark the troops at once, and
                            indulged in strong language against the action of the United States. As
                            time passed, the excitement and indignation among them began visibly to
                            increase. The water tanks of the steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>
                            had been left open by the Nicaraguan soldiers during the night, and all
                            the fresh water allowed to escape, and the aforesaid soldiers were
                            clamoring for water during their detention. Finally some of the
                            officials made signals to the Government wharf, about 50 yards away, at
                            which was stationed a force of Nicaraguan soldiers, and two boats were
                            sent out to the steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi> in response.
                            Affiant farther states that in the wheel-house of the steamship <hi
                                rend="italic">Yulu</hi> were Ensign Kuenzli with two men, the
                            remainder at the time of the occurrence being disposed about the roof of
                            the upper deck. There were also present Carlos Lacayo, Ramon Ehriquez, a
                            merchant from Grey Town, Nicaragua, and the affiant, Norman L. Latson.
                            The latter, leaning out of the window of the wheel-house, heard Minister
                            Madriz, who was accompanied by Judge-Advocate Portocarrero, order
                            Captain Johnson, of the steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>, to take
                            his vessel in to the Government wharf at once and discharge the troops.
                            This Captain Johnson refused to do, stating that his vessel was in
                            control <pb n="187" xml:id="pg_187" facs="0194"/>of the officer from the
                            U. S. S. <hi rend="italic">Columbia</hi>, and therefore not in his power
                            to obey such a demand.</p>
                        <p>Affiant further states that thereupon Judge-Advocate Portocarrero,
                            closely followed by Minister Madriz, rushed into the wheelhouse of the
                            steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>. They were both white with anger,
                            and Portocarrero had, in his right hand, with his finger on the spring,
                            a clasp-knife with a blade about 8 inches long. Ensign Kuenzli sat on a
                            portion of the steering gear of the steamship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Yulu</hi>, within a few feet of Portocarrero, and with his back
                            toward him. He was reading, but remarked later that he was aware
                            something serious was impending. The two other men from the <hi
                                rend="italic">Columbia</hi> were on the opposite side of the
                            wheelhouse, looking out of a window, and with their backs also turned to
                            the Nicaraguan officials. Most of the rifles belonging to the
                            man-of-war’s men were stacked in this wheelhouse, and the Nicaraguans
                            were aware that it would be almost impossible for the men who were on
                            the roof to reach them in case of sudden attack. There were at least 100
                            Nicaraguans on the upper deck of the steamship <hi rend="italic"
                                >Yulu</hi>, and completely surrounding her wheelhouse.</p>
                        <p>When Madriz and Portocarrero rushed into the wheelhouse they gathered
                            around the two doors, which open on to the deck, and, with fixed
                            bayonets and drawn swords, listened to what transpired. Portocarrero
                            commenced a violent and insulting tirade against the United States,
                            claiming, among other things, that her action in refusing to allow
                            Nicaraguan troops to disembark was cowardly and the tyrannical
                            oppression of a small and defenseless country by a large and powerful
                            one. Madriz agreed with him, and stated that he considered this action
                            an insult to Nicaragua through him; he further said that they had agreed
                            to wait two hours for an answer and that nearly three had elapsed.
                            Portocarrero then said, turning to Madriz: “Let us make them take the
                            ship into the wharf and disembark the troops.” Affiant then said: “You
                            are making a serious mistake, General Portocarrero, and do not
                            understand the circumstances of this detention.”</p>
                        <p>Portocarrero appeared to lose control of himself, and being seconded by
                            some encouraging exclamations from the crowd around the doors, he raised
                            his knife, and, pointing toward the young officer, said to Madriz: “You
                            give the command and I will throw myself upon him, and we will take the
                            ship into the wharf against any resistance on their part.” At this
                            instant, and before Minister Madriz could reply, Captain Johnson, of the
                            steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi>, stepped into the room and said
                            that he saw smoke across the lagoon, and believed that the launch was
                            returning. Madriz then turned to Portocarrero, who still stood, knife in
                            hand, and said: “We will wait and see whether it is the launch; we will
                            give them half an hour more, and if it is not, we will go in anyhow.”
                            Both Lacayo and Enriquez endeavored to dissuade Portocarrero from the
                            position he had taken, but they were not listened to. The smoke
                            mentioned by Captain Johnson proved to be from the steam launch of the
                                <hi rend="italic">Columbia</hi>, and in due time Lieutenant Lowry
                            reached the steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi> with instructions from
                            Captain Sumner to permit the disembarkation of the Nicaraguan
                            troops.</p>
                        <p>Affiant further states that from his knowledge of the mood and temper of
                            the Nicaraguan officials, and from the threats he personally heard
                            expressed, he deposes and says that he believes a disaster and massacre
                            aboard the steamship <hi rend="italic">Yulu</hi> was only averted by the
                            timely sighting of the <hi rend="italic">Columbia’s</hi> steam
                            launch.</p>
                        <p>Affiant further states that he is a native of the United States, born <pb
                                n="188" xml:id="pg_188" facs="0195"/>in the State of New York, and
                            for five years a resident of Nicaragua. He also states that he
                            thoroughly understands Spanish, in which language the above remarks were
                            made.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the morning of the 15th instant I received
                        from Commander Charles O’Neil a telegram stating that the U. S. S. <hi
                            rend="italic">Marblehead</hi>, with the two American exiles aboard, was
                        at Port Limon, Costa Rica, awaiting instructions from our Government as “to
                        their disposition and inquiring if the Nicaraguan Government was desirous of
                        sending any telegrams to Bluefields concerning them.</p>
                    <p>During my call of congratulation upon the President of Nicaragua on that
                        afternoon, I took occasion to speak to him concerning the case of the
                        exiles. He refused to send any communication, which fact I communicated to
                        Commander O’Neil. The following day I sent you a telegram upon the subject
                        confirmed in my No, 395. Yesterday I addressed the inclosed note to the

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Minister</hi>: On the 15th instant I had the
                            honor of a brief personal interview with His Excellency the President,
                            in regard to securing to the two American prisoners, or exiles, Messrs,
                            Lampton and Wiltbank, a full, free, and fair trial with guarantees of a
                            complete defense, or their unconditional liberation. In this unofficial
                            conversation I understood the President to assure me that he would give
                            the matter his immediate attention on the arrival of Special
                            Commissioner Madriz, whose return, he stated, would be on the 21st.</p>
                        <p>The occasion of my writing this note at this time arises out of the fact

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: On the 22d ultimo the Department received from
                        Dr. Guzman, the Nicaraguan minister at this capital, a note, copy of which
                        is inclosed for your information.<note n="1" xml:id="d113fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d108">No. 108</ref>.</note> You will observe the minister
                        says that the two Americans, Wiltbank and Lampton, were expelled from
                        Nicaragua because they took part, in July last, in the revolutionary
                        movement at Bluelields, ignored the sovereignty of the Republic over
                        Mosquito, and supported the so-called government of Robert Henry
                        Clarence.</p>
                    <p>For many years this Government has steadily maintained that Mosquito belonged
                        to Nicaragua, and was subject to its laws and authority; and if it be true,
                        as asserted, that Wiltbank and Lampton participated in an insurrection
                        having for its object the overthrow of that authority, this Government can
                        not consistently challenge the right to expel them, provided it was
                        exercised in a becoming manner and without undue harshness.</p>
                    <p>Under the treaty concluded between the United States and the Republic of
                        Nicaragua in 1867, citizens of this country enjoy the right of residing and
                        engaging in commercial or other business pursuits in Nicaragua, and even if
                        Wiltbank and Lampton forfeited that right in the manner claimed, they were
                        entitled, before being forcibly expelled, to a reasonable time to dispose of
                        any business interests or possessions they had acquired there. This was
                        denied them. On an invitation (friendly on its face) from the chief
                        Nicaraguan official at Bluefields, they visited the public building at that
                        place, and upon entering were arrested, upon no disclosed charge, not
                        permitted to leave or communicate in any way with counsel or friends, taken
                        to Managua, the capital, and there expelled from the country,
                        notwithstanding your intervention in their behalf. I refrain from
                        characterizing the means adopted to obtain the custody of these men.</p>
                    <p>While it is gratifying to receive the assurance of Nicaragua through its
                        minister here, that, on their written request, these Americans will be
                        permitted to “return to Bluefields for a reasonable time, for the purpose of
                        disposing of their property, should they hold any,” the President is
                        unwilling, without further information, to accept that assurance as the full
                        measure of justice due from Nicaragua. They deny participation in the
                        insurrection, or that they have done anything which could justly deprive
                        them of their rights as American citizens in Nicaragua, under the treaty of
                        1867. The Secretary of the Navy is informed by the commander of one of our
                        war vessels, anchored off Bluefields, that they are on board his ship, and
                        desire an immediate open trial, and if that be denied them, they be
                        permitted to land and again engage in their interrupted business without
                        further molestation. On receipt of this instruction you will, without delay,
                        ascertain and report what, if any, foundation exists for the charges upon
                        which these men were expelled, not omitting to obtain their own statements
                        under oath.</p>

                        United States in Nicaragua, as Your Excellency had the goodness to inform me
                        in your note of August 18, last.</p>
                    <p>It is gratifying to my Government, as well as to myself personally, to be
                        able to remove, in so conclusive a manner, the unfavorable impression which

                        Mayorga, which would never in any case have had more weight than that of an

                        <p>In the city of Granada, at 3.30 p.m., on the 26th September, 1894, Don
                            Roman Mayorga Rivas, being present in my office, stated that his name is
                            as above written; that he is of age, a resident of Granada, and a
                            planter. I swore him in due form, notifying him of the penalties for
                            perjury in criminal matters, and asked him if it was true that, at the
                            time when preparations were being made for the last expedition to
                            Bluefields, the witness said to the American minister, Mr. Lewis Baker,
                            or to any other person, in his official capacity as under secretary of
                            the ministry of foreign relations, or in private as an individual, that
                            the Government of this Republic intended to send a thousand troops and
                            four guns to Mosquitia, and to kill all the Americans in that territory,
                            if it was necessary, in order to establish and maintain the supremacy of
                            Nicaragua there; to all which he replied:</p>
                        <p>That it was not true that, either in his official or private capacity, he
                            had said anything whatever to Minister Baker with regard to the
                            expedition to Bluefields, and that he appealed to the testimony of Mr.
                            Baker himself, with whom the witness has never discussed the subject of
                            the last events at Bluefields, which compelled the Government to send
                            the expedition, because at that time the witness was not in charge of
                            the portfolio of foreign relations, but Dr. Madriz.</p>
                        <p>That the only person with whom he conversed about the expedition was Mr.
                            Chamberlain, and that only when the expedition was a matter of public
                            notoriety, the proclamation of General President Zelaya having been
                            promulgated. The witness told Mr. Chamberlain, in his private
                            capacity—for he had no occasion to talk to him on the subject in any
                            other—that the Government intended to punish the rebels and their
                            instigators. These views were the same as those of the said proclamation
                            and of the official journal.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the witness declares that he has not replied to a note
                            addressed to him by the secretariat of foreign relations on this
                            subject, because he is awaiting a reply to a letter which he had
                            addressed to Mr. Baker, asking him for a categoric answer which would
                            bring out the truth, to wit, that the witness has never, either in his
                            official character, nor as a private individual, said the least thing to
                            Mr. Baker having reference to the Bluefields expedition. It was read to
                            him; he affirms and signs with me and the secretary, who attests: “Juan
                            J. Bodan. R. Mayorga Rivas, Before me, José Ma. Bodan, secretary.”</p>

                        excellency, as it proves clearly that the Nicaraguan Government is always

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: The Department has received yours of October
                        26 last, with inclosures, relating to the Nicaraguan Government’s forcible
                        seizure and occupation of the valuable property near Bluefields, known as
                        the “bluffs,” owned in part by United States citizens. In reply to the
                        American owners’ protest against this action, which you submitted to that
                        Government, the minister of foreign affairs has written you that under the
                        constitution of Nicaragua and international law, “no foreigner can solicit
                        the intervention of his Government in defense of his rights or pretensions
                        until after he has exhausted all remedies which the laws of the country in
                        which he lives allow him, and his complaints have been disregarded with
                        notorious injustice.”</p>
                    <p>What remedies the laws of the country give for such cases are not stated. You
                        appear to think that the courts of Nicaragua should be appealed to for
                        redress before this Government can interfere diplomatically. The note from
                        Mr. Matus to you seems to intimate that the injured parties are required to
                        apply directly to the Nicaraguan Government for relief, which, if granted,
                        will be of grace rather than of right.</p>
                    <p>In reply to Mr. Matus’s suggestion that the parties should seek relief by
                        direct appeal to his Government, it may be remarked that international law
                        requires complaints on behalf of foreigners to come through their own
                        Government. Unless it assumes the responsibility of presenting them, they
                        need not be considered.</p>
                    <p>Your suggestion that recourse to the courts should be exhausted before
                        diplomatic intervention is resorted to, is as a general proposition sound,
                        assuming of course that the courts have jurisdiction. But the treaty between
                        the two countries entitles American citizens whose property has been taken
                        by Nicaragua for public purposes, without full and just compensation paid in
                        advance, to invoke in the first instance the diplomatic intervention of the
                        United States in their behalf.</p>
                    <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0203"/>
                    <p>The very act of the Government of Nicaragua in taking the property without
                        full and just compensation paid in advance was a violation of the treaty
                        (sec. 3, Art IX; treaty of 1867.) No action of its courts (assuming them to
                        have jurisdiction of such suits) can change the character of the act, or
                        make it any the less a plain violation of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Should the courts decide in favor of the aggrieved parties and award them
                        compensation, and that compensation be actually paid, the treaty-would still
                        remain violated, because the compensation was not paid in advance of the
                        taking of the property. To claim that redress must be sought through the
                        courts is to claim that payment bf compensation may be postponed till the
                        property has actually been taken, in face of the treaty which says that
                        payment must be made in advance. One party to a treaty can not thus
                        practically change its terms and evade its requirements.</p>
                    <p>The American citizens suffering by this arbitrary appropriation of their
                        property are entitled to the aid of their Government in securing from
                        Nicaragua adequate indemnity for any losses they may have sustained.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to state that yesterday, by
                        appointment, I called on Lord Kimberley at the foreign office, and the
                        subject of the interview was the present condition of affairs between Great
                        Britain and Nicaragua, arising out of the rough treatment of Mr. Hatch, a
                        representative of the former Government at Bluefields, at the hands of
                        Nicaraguan authorities.</p>
                    <p>His lordship stated the occurrences complained of dated some three months
                        ago, and, although explanation had at once been demanded, no response was
                        made until two days ago, when a very voluminous reply in Spanish
                        (necessitating translation) had been sent in, but which he had not yet had
                        time to consider.</p>
                    <p>For the purpose of sending this dispatch by the mail to-day, it is enough to
                        say that his lordship desires explicitly to have it understood that any
                        action in the way of obtaining redress from Nicaragua which Her Majesty’s
                        Government may hereafter decide is necessary in the premises is wholly
                        unconnected with any political or conventional question touching the
                        Mosquito Reservation, but is simply a proceeding, on the grounds of
                        international law, to obtain satisfaction for an affront.</p>
                    <p>His lordship repeated to me, with much emphasis, his desire that this should
                        be understood, and that he had no other wish than to act in accord and with
                        the approval of the United States in matters concerning political control in
                        Central America.</p>
                    <p>I reminded his lordship of the very imperfect civilization of the region
                        where these difficulties had arisen, and of the incidental departures from
                        the regulated proprieties of official life and legal methods which were
                        naturally to be looked for in that quarter.</p>
                    <p>I told him in general substance the views I had expressed to Señor Barrios
                        here in October last, and lately in Washington to Senor Guzinan, in relation
                        to the entire facility and finality with which the Government of Nicaragua
                        could pacify the entire region and absorb the small remnant of Indian self
                        government in Mosquito by simply dealing with generosity and gentle pressure
                        with the leading Indians, and procure that “formal incorporation” of the
                        territory of the Mosquito Reservation and the rest of Nicaragua provided for
                        in the treaty of Managua, and thus the entire question of jurisdiction and
                        of British or other interference could be ended.</p>
                    <p>Lord Kimberley warmly seconded this view, and expressed a desire it should be
                        carried out.</p>
                    <p>Thus it will be perceived that Nicaragua has the matter in her own hands,
                        and, by the exercise of common intelligence and discretion, can relieve
                        herself from all possible complications growing out of past treaties, and
                        her ill-advised submission to Austrian arbitration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Barrios, who called here yesterday, produced a telegram in Spanish,
                        unsigned, but from his Government, stating that Mr. Gosling, the British
                        minister, declined to accept decrees of the Nicaraguan commissioner in
                        Mosquito.</p>
                    <p>This I assume to mean that until Nicaragua has given the explanation demanded
                        by the British Government as to the forcible arrest and deportation of their
                        agent they will suspend relations with them.</p>
                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0205"/>
                    <p>If Nicaragua has (as is quite probable) exceeded the bounds of international
                        amity and courtesy, she can not too soon place herself right by promptly
                        making just amends, I am satisfied Great Britain has no insidious or
                        unstated purposes or designs in relation to Central America; and, together
                        with the United States, is best served by a condition of absolute peace and
                        order in that region, uninterfered with ab exteriori.</p>

                        instant, to lay before you a report of the interview I had just held with
                        the Earl of Kimberley in relation to Nicaraguan affairs and the British
                        action connected therewith.</p>
                    <p>Late on Saturday night, the 24th instant—and after my dispatch had gone—I
                        received your cablegram in cipher of that date (of which a translation is

                        in which I recounted my report to you.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday (Monday) afternoon I received a reply from his lordship, inviting
                        me to call upon him at the foreign office, and at once went there.</p>

                    <p>Lord Kimberley, having my note of the 26th lying before him, stated that my
                        report to you of the interview of Friday previous, as recited in my note of
                        that day to him, was entirely accurate, but that he had not, then informed
                        me of his latest telegraphic instructions to the British minister at
                        Nicaragua respecting a number of decrees which had been lately promulgated
                        at Blueflelds by the Nicaraguan commissioner, and which, pending the
                        consideration of the incident of the arrest and expulsion of the British
                        proconsul and the proposed discussion here by Señor Barrios, were not
                        accepted by the British Government, but that a notification of a cautious
                        nature—”a caveat” (as his lordship termed it)—had been filed by the British
                        minister, in order that the assent and approval by Great Britain of these
                        decrees, so far as they affected British interests in Nicaragua and British
                        duty under the treaty of Managua and the Austrian award thereunder, should
                        not be considered as conclusively given, but to remain suspended until the
                        mission of Senor Barrios and the incident of Hatches arrest should have
                        reached a satisfactory termination.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Lord Kimberley</hi>: After the interview which
                            I had the honor to hold with your lordship on last Friday afternoon I
                            wrote to my Government a full statement of what you then told me you had
                            in possible contemplation in relation to Nicaragua, after you should
                            have considered the reply of that Government (then undergoing
                            translation from the Spanish) to your demand for explanation of the
                            incident of the arrest and forcible expulsion by the Nicaraguan
                            authorities of Mr. Hatch, the locum tenens of the British consul at
                            Bluefields, in August last.</p>
                        <p>I reported very fully your statement of the attitude of Great Britain
                            toward Nicaragua and your desire to have it explicitly understood by the
                            United States that any measures Her Majesty’s Government might feel
                            obliged to adopt, by reason of the alleged ill treatment of Proconsul
                            Hatch, or of other British subjects, at Bluefields, would be wholly
                            apart and unconnected with the “Mosquito” question or the jurisdiction
                            of Nicaragua over the inhabitants of the territory included in the
                            region that bears that name; and that you proposed to proceed, solely
                            upon grounds of international duty and self-respect, to procure such
                            redress for an alleged wrong to your citizens as might be found just and
                            necessary, and that no jurisdictional or other question would be
                            involved.</p>
                        <p>Late on Saturday night, and after my dispatch had gone, I received a
                            telegram from Secretary Gresham to the effect that the Nicaraguan
                            minister at Washington stated that he had been informed by his
                            Government that the British minister to Nicaragua had announced that his
                            Government does not accept Nicaraguan rule in the Mosquito territory,
                            and that he had sent for a British man-of-war.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary is not disposed to credit these statements, and merely <pb
                                n="200" xml:id="pg_200" facs="0207"/>asks for information; but,
                            before answering his telegram, I wanted to keep you advised of all the
                            facts and, if you think I should be further informed than I was by you
                            in our interview of Friday, you will kindly let me know, and I will at
                            once come and see you.</p>

                    <p rend="center">* * * * * * *</p>
                    <p>Lord Kimberley’s statement to you that the attitude of Great Britain in this
                        matter is wholly unconnected with any political or conventional question
                        touching the Mosquito Reservation is in gratifying confirmation of the

                        was prepared for his lordship’s acquiescence in your view that the political
                        questions involved may readily yield to pacific and generous treatment on
                        the part of Nicaragua toward the Mosquito Indians, with a view to their
                        formal incorporation with the Republic, as contemplated in the treaty of

                        accept decrees of the Nicaraguan commissioner in Mosquito,” is more explicit
                        than other information here received, and suggests that the minister’s
                        opposition may have been in regard to particular measures affecting British
                        subjects.</p>

                        <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: (1) Since completing my No. 74 yesterday I
                            have received the following information from the commanding officer of
                            H. M. S. <hi rend="italic">Mohawk:</hi> She is being coaled preparatory
                            to leaving for Havana on Friday, next then to Bermuda to join the
                            squadron there, and where she is expected to arrive by the 27th inst. He
                            states that everything was perfectly quiet at Bluefields at time of his
                            departure. Most of the time since we left was spent at Port Limon,
                            making a run up to Bluefields about every fortnight and remaining there
                            two or three days. He was relieved by the <hi rend="italic">Pelican</hi>
                            and left for this place on Friday last. Cabezas was still in charge of
                            affairs at Bluefields, with Weinberger as alcalde, or chief of the
                            municipality. He thinks there no longer exists any necessity for keeping
                            a man-of-war. in that vicinity, but that the consular representatives
                            would be fully capable of handling the situation while it remains as at
                            present. There was nothing to turn over to his relief, the <hi
                                rend="italic">Pelican</hi>, except the case of a family at Little
                            Com Island, which he had no time to conduct to a finish.</p>
                        <p>Cabezas promised him, however, that they would be allowed to return, and
                            that their property would be restored to them, but as most of the latter
                            was in live stock, the Nicaraguan soldiers had probably exterminated
                            them by this time. He succeeded in effecting thereturn of Conner
                            (English subject), whose property on Great Corn Island was in danger of
                            confiscation. There were a number of vague charges against this man, but
                            upon a close investigation Captain Stuart proved to his satisfaction
                            that none of these charges could be substantiated, or in fact had any
                            foundation, and he had no further trouble in getting permission for
                            Conner to return.</p>

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As related to affairs in Nicaragua, I have now
                        the honor to inclose herewith a copy of the telegram (translated) which I
                        received from you on the 17th instant,<note n="*" xml:id="d135fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d131">No. 131</ref>.</note> and also a copy of your
                        subsequent telegram of the 20th instant, <note n="†" xml:id="d135fn2">See
                                <ref target="#d132">No. 132</ref>.</note> and of my telegraphic
                        reply of the same date. <note n="‡" xml:id="d135fn3">See <ref target="#d133"
                                >No. 133</ref>.</note></p>
                    <p>I have also the honor to transmit herewith a copy of a personal note from me
                        to the Earl of Kimberley, dated the 20th instant, and his lordship’s reply
                        thereto, dated the 21st.</p>
                    <p>The purport of the statements at the foreign office is an emphatic denial of
                        all reports or rumors indicating any intention or disposition on the part of
                        the British Government to mingle in the local political struggles and
                        disorders in Nicaragua and the province of Mosquito.</p>
                    <p>As I have heretofore stated in this connection, the “formal incorporation” of
                        the inhabitants of the Mosquito region with the rest of Nicaragua is the
                        best and most complete solution of all doubt or qualification respecting the
                        full sovereignty of Nicaragua over the entire coast, causing the treaty of
                        Managua to become un fait accompli, and the Austrian award and
                        interpretation of that instrument a superfluous and negligible quantity.</p>
                    <p>Her Majesty’s Government are well pleased with the prospect of <pb n="204"
                            xml:id="pg_204" facs="0211"/>having “Clarence” and his fortunes
                        eliminated from their political responsibility.</p>
                    <p>There was the most open expression of satisfaction at the foreign office upon
                        the reported voluntary incorporation of the Indians with the rest of
                        Nicaragua, for it was a consummation devoutly to be wished, and they were
                        glad to be free from the subject.</p>
                    <p>In my last telegram I referred to the obvious attempts, by sensational
                        reports, to create mischievous misunderstandings between the two
                        Governments, and my statement was founded upon the telegraphic accounts
                        which find their way into the newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

                            Secretary Gresham, stating that the commander of U S. S. <hi

                            there been informed that “Clarence,” the titular head of the Mosquito

                            Bluefields, and that recognition of Nicaraguan order, and the late
                            action of tie inhabitants of the Mosquito region incorporating
                            themselves with the rest of Nicaragua, was refused by the British
                            authorities or those representing them.</p>
                        <p>I need hardly say that Mr. Gresham naturally discredits such reports; but
                            I would be glad to have a word from yon to set them at rest

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit to your
                        excellency a copy of the resolution passed November 20 last by the Mosquitia
                        convention, composed of delegates from all the native tribes of the region
                        called the <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0212"/>Reserve, and which from
                        the present date will be known by the name of “Department Zelaya.”</p>
                    <p>As your excellency will observe, the convention resolved, freely and
                        spontaneously, the absolute incorporation of that territory in the Republic
                        of Nicaragua, recognizing the constitution of that Republic in a decisive
                        and formal manner, in doing which they did no more than carry out the
                        provisions of article 4 of the treaty of January, 1860, between Nicaragua
                        and Great Britain, generally known under the name of the “treaty of
                        Managua,” in which it was provided, as was proper, that nothing should
                        prevent, at any future time, the Mosquito Indians from carrying out the
                        aforesaid incorporation and becoming subject to the laws and general
                        regulations of the Republic, in place of being governed by their own customs
                        and laws.</p>
                    <p>This decision of the Mosquito delegates puts an end to the difficulties which
                        existed in that portion of the Nicaraguan territory, and at the same time
                        renders impossible, in future, any attempt to ignore the recognition of the
                        absolute sovereignty of Nicaragua over the region formerly called
                        “Mosquitia,” seeing that, in view of the resolutions of the natives
                        themselves, no pretext at all can be found for such a procedure.</p>
                    <p>I take pleasure in assuring your excellency that Nicaragua highly appreciates
                        the kind and opportune action of the Government of the United States during
                        the difficulties to which I have referred, and that she recognizes how
                        powerfully that action has contributed to the happy and tinal settlement of
                        the question.</p>
                    <p>On my own part, I desire to render to your excellency personally my most
                        sincere thanks for the friendly interest which you have always been pleased
                        to show me in the said matter, thus contributing in an efficient manner to
                        bring the affair to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>

                        <p>Whereas the change which took place on the 12th of February of the
                            present year, was due to the efforts of the Nicaraguan authorities to
                            endeavor to free us from the slavery in which we were;</p>
                        <p>Whereas we have agreed wholly to submit to the laws and authorities of
                            Nicaragua for the purpose of forming part of their political and
                            administrative organization;</p>
                        <p>Whereas the lack of a respectable and legitimate government is always the
                            cause of calamity to a people, in which condition we have been for so
                            long a time;</p>
                        <p>Whereas one of the reasons of the backward condition in which we live
                            doubtless was the improper use of the revenues of the Mosquito
                            territory, which were employed for purposes which had nothing to do with
                            good administrative order;</p>
                        <p>Whereas although the constitution of Nicaragua provides for all the
                            necessities and aspirations of a free people, we, nevertheless, desire
                            to retain special privileges in accord with our customs and our racial

                    <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have received your dispatch of the 22d
                        instant, confirming your telegraphic denial, on Lord Kimberley’s explicit
                        authority, of the rumors of intended British intervention in Nicaragua and
                        the supposed purpose to countenance the restoration of the Mosquito Indian
                        regime under Clarence.</p>
                    <p>Your present dispatch amplifies the assurances you had already obtained at
                        the foreign office, as reported in yours of November 27, that the voluntary
                        incorporation of the Mosquito Indians into the Republic of Nicaragua would
                        be a welcome and final solution of the problem of Mosquitia.</p>
                    <p>I inclose for your information in this regard translation of a note addressed
                        to me by the Nicaraguan minister<note n="1" xml:id="d137fn1">See <ref
                                target="#d136">No. 136</ref>.</note> here on the 28th instant,
                        communicating text of the instrument by which those Indians have become
                        incorporated into the Republic and subject to its general laws, with
                        reservation of certain defined privileges, as well as a copy of my reply to
                        Dr. Guzman.<note n="2" xml:id="d137fn2">See <ref target="#d138">No.

                        your note of the 28th instant, communicating to me a copy of an instrument
                        by which the native Mosquito Indians have become incorporated into the
                        Republic of Nicaragua and subject to its general laws.</p>
                    <p>Having already, upon information received from the United States minister at
                        Managua and our naval commander at Bluefields, as well as from yourself,
                        orally expressed my satisfaction at this outcome of a situation which for
                        nearly a year has demanded careful consideration, I take this opportunity to
                        state the gratification it affords this Government to see the voluntary and
                        orderly accomplishment of this important step by the native Mosquito Indians
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>Accept, etc.,</p>
