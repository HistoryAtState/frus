                <p>The present volume of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations of the United
                        States</hi> is one of a special series of <hi rend="italic">Foreign
                        Relations</hi> volumes covering the relations of the United States with
                    China for the years 1942 to 1949, inclusive.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes are primarily concerned with
                    documentation of diplomatic activities within the responsibility of the
                    Department of State. Some documents from other agencies have been printed where
                    they have been deemed necessary to supplement the Department’s records and thus
                    give a better understanding of the problems treated.</p>
                <p>Military records dealing with China during 1943 are discussed in narrative
                    histories published or in preparation by the Departments of the Army and Air
                    Force. Most important for this period are <hi rend="italic">United States Army
                        in World War II: The China–Burma–India Theater: Stilwell’s Mission to
                        China</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Stilwell’s Command Problems</hi>, by
                    Charles F. Romanus and Riley Sunderland, published in 1953 and 1956,
                    respectively, and <hi rend="italic">The Army Air Forces in World War II</hi>,
                    edited by W. F. Craven and J. L. Cate, Volume IV, published in 1950. These
                    histories provide relevant background information for documents referring to
                    military activities.</p>
                <p>The preparation of the present <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> series on
                    China has been under the general supervision of the Chief of the Historical
                    Division, G. Bernard Noble. The volumes were compiled in the Foreign Relations
                    Branch of the Historical Division under the direction of the Chief of the Branch
                    (Editor of <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>), E. R. Perkins, and the
                    Assistant Chief of the Branch, Gustave A. Nuermberger, by a research staff
                    consisting of John G. Reid, Francis C. Prescott, Velma H. Cassidy, Herbert A.
                    Fine, and Ralph R. Goodwin. The 1943 China volume was compiled by Mr. Reid, Mr.
                    Prescott, and Mr. Goodwin.</p>
                <p>The Division of Publishing Services is responsible with respect to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi> volumes for the proofreading and
                    editing of copy, the preparation of indexes, and the distribution of printed
                    copies. Under the general direction of the Chief of the Division, Bruce Buttles,
                    the editorial functions mentioned above are performed by the Foreign Relations
                    Editing Branch in charge of Elizabeth A. Vary.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the

                            <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> (<hi rend="italic">L’Impartial</hi>)
                        of January 27, 1943, on the subject “Discard Old Antiquated and Outdated
                        Concepts and Establish the New Sincere Unified Military Strategy”,
                        discussing the present political orientation of China.</p>
                    <p>The writer of the editorial, basing his observations on recent comment made
                        in <hi rend="italic">The Nation</hi> (New York), states that it is to be
                        considered that people who believe that the United States and Great Britain
                        should refrain from giving all-out aid to China lest it become an aggressor
                        nation or turn Fascist after the war are still obsessed by <pb n="3" xml:id="pg_3" facs="0013"/>outdated concepts of the age of imperialism.
                        China, it is stated, which has fought the longest and sacrificed the most in
                        the present war, is entitled to demand a strategy which would support the
                        carrying on of a decisive war and lead to a decisive victory. In that
                        connection, the writer observes, it is necessary that there be neither
                        underestimation nor overestimation of Japan.</p>
                    <p>There would seem to be little danger that China will become within the
                        visible future an aggressive Fascist nation. However, without doubting the
                        sincerity of the belief expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>
                        that China will become a republic along the democratic lines laid down in
                        general terms in the Three People’s Principles (San Min Chu Yi) of Dr. Sun
                        Yat-sen, the Kuomintang leadership at present shows little promise of
                        putting those principles into effect. The Kuomintang, in fact, gives every
                        evidence of intention to perpetuate its present one-party control of the
                        country. Consequently, the prospect is that, unless liberalizing elements
                        gain the ascendency in the government, either internal unity will be
                        destroyed in the clash between the dominating Kuomintang and opposing forces
                        or Fascist-like domination will continue to the detriment of aspirations for
                        the development in China of a democratic political and economic system.</p>

                    <p>With regard to the invitations which Madame Chiang had received to make
                        addresses in Washington, Dr. Liu said that Madame Chiang had it in mind to
                        make only one address while here.<note n="10" xml:id="d5fn10">Madame Chiang

               </p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu stated further that Madame Chiang would make a visit to Chicago and
                        then to the West Coast and contemplated making one public address in each of
                        a few of the larger cities. Dr. Liu said that Madame Chiang planned not to
                        make a great number of public speeches but to keep such speeches to a small
                        number.</p>
                    <p>I told Dr. Liu that we wished him and the Embassy to feel free to come to us

                        we all desired to be of the utmost helpfulness.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu expressed appreciation and said that if there came to our knowledge
                        particulars as to the arrangements made by the White House with regard to
                        Madame Chiang’s visit in Washington, he would appreciate it if we would pass
                        this information on to the Embassy as it would be helpful to the Embassy in
                        making its plans. I said that we would be very glad to keep this in
                        mind.</p>

                    <p>There has recently been a noticeable increase in the number of suggestions
                        from Chinese sources that China might in the not too distant future, lacking
                        greater military aid from the United States, cease to be an active
                        belligerent.</p>
                    <p>Some of these suggestions have emphasized China’s fear of Russia; others,
                        suspicion of the ultimate intentions of the United States and Great Britain
                        with respect to the Far East. Some have included the “possibility” that
                        China might make some kind of “peace” with Japan.</p>
                    <p>These suggestions may reflect (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a serious growth of
                        depression and “defeatism” on the part of some Chinese spokesmen and some
                        Chinese leaders; and possibly, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) intensification of
                        a campaign <pb n="5" xml:id="pg_5" facs="0015"/>(perhaps having connection
                        with the visit to this country of Madame Chiang Kai-shek) to bring strong
                        pressure upon the President and his chief political and military advisers to
                        effect immediate and greatly increased military aid to China. That is,
                        Chinese leaders may already have fallen farther than has been realized into
                        a mood of depression and/or have conceived a campaign of pressure upon us as
                        a means of alleviating the psychological, the economic and the military
                        situation in China.</p>
                    <p rend="center">I</p>
                    <p>The situation of China is without doubt critical in many ways.
                        Notwithstanding the extraordinary amount of financial assistance which we
                        have rendered to China, the country’s finances are admittedly in a
                        precarious position which is steadily getting worse. Practically no consumer
                        goods are entering China. The inflationary process is also aggravated by
                        deficient internal transportation and by hoarding of and speculation in
                        foodstuffs and other commodities. Wholesale and retail price indices have
                        risen in Chungking approximately 7,000 percent of those prevailing in 1937
                        and the Chinese dollar has depreciated to a value on the black market of one
                        cent or less United States currency. The situation has seemingly reached
                        point where the provision of financial aid to China offers no solution.
                        Restoration of China’s land routes to the outside world to an extent
                        sufficient to enable the importation into China of substantially increased
                        quantities of consumer goods in addition to military supplies would seem to
                        be essential if the present inflationary tendency is to be counteracted.
                        Reopening an important land route to the outside world would not only
                        furnish some purely economic alleviation of China’s economic ills but would
                        also increase public confidence in Chinese Government currency and in
                        China’s economy in general and thus exert a very healthy and beneficial
                        influence.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II</p>
                    <p>While the most active phases of the Sino-Japanese hostilities ended some two
                        and one-half years ago, the Chinese since that time (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) have in general held their lines against the Japanese forces in
                        China while the latter have been intent upon consolidating their position
                        rather than advancing farther westward, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) have
                        simultaneously contained some 600,000 out of approximately 2,250,000 troops.
                        (China has, of course, contributed to the war effort in a number of other
                        ways: for example, China’s continuation in the war against Japan has held
                        open to the United States the possibility of utilizing air bases in east
                        China for a direct attack upon Japan and the fact that China has not <pb n="6" xml:id="pg_6" facs="0016"/>been conquered has contributed to a
                        continuing loss of Japanese prestige and Japanese morale and a continuing
                        drain upon Japan’s military strength.) Nevertheless, while the Chinese have
                        some two million and a half troops in the field, only a comparatively small
                        portion of these troops is adequately armed, not a single division is
                        understood to have sufficient light and heavy artillery, and air support has
                        been practically nonexistent except for the American Volunteer Group which
                        operated largely in Burma and the more recent operations in China of United
                        States air units. In these circumstances it cannot be assumed that, if China
                        is not given general military assistance on a considerable scale, it will be
                        possible for the Chinese armies to continue indefinitely to contain the
                        Japanese forces, especially if the latter should undertake concerted effort
                        to advance. Furthermore, as no one can say how long the war will last, it
                        would obviously be a grave mistake not to make effort, by way of assisting
                        the Chinese, to keep open the possibility of using China’s potentialities,
                        including potential air bases in Chekiang and other coastal areas, for the
                        future large-scale offensive against Japan.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III</p>
                    <p>There are a number of unfortunate aspects in the political situation in
                        China. Maneuverings by various cliques and factions in the Government are,
                        it is believed, unimportant from the point of view of Chiang Kai-shek’s
                        position (in as much as none of them appears to be directed against Chiang)
                        and from the point of view of bringing about an increased likelihood of
                        China’s withdrawing from the war. But if Chiang should be eliminated by
                        serious illness or death there is a strong possibility that the Chinese
                        Government would fall apart.</p>
                    <p>There is the continuing dissension between the Kuomintang (including Chiang
                        Kai-shek) and the Chinese Communists. It is not believed there is
                        probability at present or in the near future of an outbreak of open civil
                        war as a result of this dissension; latest information is to the effect that
                        Chiang is sensible of the dangers in the situation and will refrain from
                        taking such repressive measures as might lead to open civil war. Meantime,
                        the Communist armies are practically immobilized from action against the
                        Japanese, and considerable bodies of Central Government troops stationed at
                        various places as checks against the Communists are similarly immobilized.
                        As for the future, unforeseen circumstances may cause the Government’s
                        attitude of restraint to change.</p>
                    <p>A new development in the political situation was the Nanking regime’s recent
                        declaration of war upon the United States and Great Britain. It is too early
                        to attempt to predict what the full results <pb n="7" xml:id="pg_7" facs="0017"/>of this action will be. Japanese radio announcements that
                        the Nanking regime would now recruit large numbers of Chinese troops suggest
                        that the Japanese may plan the development of active civil war in China or
                        the replacement of a certain number of Japanese garrison troops by Chinese
                        troops. While the Japanese have utilized puppet troops to some extent, this
                        has not yet become an important factor but if it continues on an expanding
                        scale it will, of course, tend to weaken China’s situation and may
                        eventually have serious results.</p>
                    <p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese hostilities and before, there has
                        been in Chinese Government and other influential circles a number of
                        individuals, not organized in a group, who, for a variety of reasons, might
                        under some circumstances not be averse to some “peace” arrangement with
                        Japan. For instance, some banking groups and prominent businessmen whose
                        interests have been centered in financial and commercial marts such as
                        Shanghai, are naturally war-weary and may have leanings toward “peace”. If
                        Chiang should be eliminated, or if China’s economic situation should become
                        so desperate as to cause a currency collapse, such uncrystallized elements
                        could be expected to exert influence in regard to any question of continuing
                        or discontinuing the war.</p>
                    <p rend="center">IV</p>
                    <p>Chinese morale is adversely affected not only by the lack of military aid
                        furnished China but by diversions of aid allocated and failure on our part
                        to fulfil promises of aid. Chinese resentment toward the British (which is
                        severe) tends to turn, at least indirectly, toward the United States because
                        the United States and Great Britain are so closely allied in the formulation
                        of global strategy.</p>
                    <p>Chinese disappointment and resentment have been reflected in a number of
                        ways. One new development, which should not be overlooked, is the apparent
                        growth in northwest China of an obvious anti-foreignism. While this may not
                        be directly related to the feeling of the Chinese that they have not been
                        fairly dealt with by their allies, it is probably a result of a
                        nationalistic spirit which has relation to China’s position as a victim of
                        aggression and an important member of the United Nations that has not—in
                        Chinese eyes—been given appropriate concrete recognition by China’s
                        allies.</p>
                    <p>There has been much publicity to the effect that China is one of the “Big
                        Four” of the United Nations. Some Chinese believe that China is not actually
                        so considered or treated and as a result thereof are disappointed and
                        resentful. They do not give weight to the facts that, with the exception of
                        Great Britain and Canada, China has substantially the same representation in
                        agencies of the United Nations as has any other country; that China while
                        legally at war with Germany <pb n="8" xml:id="pg_8" facs="0018"/>is not in
                        position to engage therein; and that China from point of view of production
                        of war materials must be largely a recipient from rather than a contributor
                        to other countries. The Chinese who are thus disappointed realize that China
                        is represented in or has liaison with only three existing international
                        commissions, committees, boards, et cetera in Washington concerned with the
                        war: liaison (believed to be limited) with the Combined Chiefs of Staff;
                        membership in the Pacific War Council; and membership in the United Nations
                        Information Board. They realize that out of the vast quantity of Lend-Lease
                        supplies furnished other countries China’s share is less than two percent.
                        These same Chinese are also aware that, despite their high hopes, China’s
                        position after the entry of the United States and Great Britain in the war
                        in the Far East has up to the present time substantially deteriorated rather
                        than been bettered.</p>
                    <p>While some Chinese leaders appear to give willing lip service to the theory
                        that Germany must be crushed before Japan, they are acutely conscious that
                        aid flowing to China is on a proportionate basis very small.</p>

                    <p>Chinese suspicion of the ultimate intentions of the United States with
                        respect to the war in the Far East appear to be based upon various
                        considerations: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) The emphasis placed by the United
                        States and Great Britain on crushing Germany before Japan; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the lack of material aid to China to enable

                        “holding” war and a war of attrition upon Japanese naval and air forces
                        rather than the recapture of Burma with a view to progressively driving the
                        Japanese in China to the seacoast and attacking Japan proper from China;
                            (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the fact that official statements made by the
                        United States regarding post-war aims and policies in the Pacific area have
                        not been made more explicit; (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) a latent fear that
                        the United States may eventually grow tired of the distant war in the
                        Pacific and eventually be willing to enter into a negotiated peace with
                        Japan. (Incidentally, some observers think that the Japanese cling to a
                        belief along these latter lines.)</p>
                    <p>Chinese suspicion of Russia is believed to be based, in part, upon fear, some
                        of which has foundation in Russia’s past acts and present attitude toward
                        Japan, and consequent speculation. Russia’s continuing caution in respect to
                        her relations with Japan causes apprehension that Russia, if the latter
                        should see advantage in so doing, might make a deal with Japan at China’s
                        expense. On the other hand, some Chinese are apprehensive that in due course
                        Russia and Japan will become involved in war and Russia will demand, when
                        Japan is defeated, <pb n="9" xml:id="pg_9" facs="0019"/>paramount influence
                        in or control—direct or indirect—over Manchuria and Korea.</p>

                    <p>In summary, the economic and psychological situation in China is already
                        critical and is deteriorating. The internal political situation holds
                        possibilities of future danger to China’s unity and to indefinite
                        continuation in the war effort. The military situation, while unsatisfactory
                        from the point of view of offensive action against the Japanese, continues
                        to be advantageous to the United Nations in that Chinese troops are in
                        general holding their lines and are thus effectively containing large
                        Japanese forces, and in addition, there is being held open for the future
                        the possibility of offensive action on and from Chinese territory by China
                        and the other United Nations against Japan. On the other hand, the Chinese
                        are becoming increasingly disappointed and resentful of the lack of military
                        aid; some Chinese spokesmen are beginning to talk of the possibility that
                        China may not long continue to be an active belligerent; and there is
                        question whether the Chinese will, without substantial military aid,
                        indefinitely continue active resistance to Japan.</p>
                    <p>The primary need in reference to the China situation is that China be given
                        more military aid, either by augmenting the American air force and other
                        American forces there or by furnishing increased material for use of Chinese
                        armies, or both. In addition, it is believed we should do everything
                        possible in the psychological and political fields to engender in the
                        Chinese a feeling that they are full partners with us and the other United
                        Nations—to the end that China will move along with the rest of the United
                        Nations in maintaining and increasing the common war efforts against the
                        Japanese.</p>

                            conversation with the President:</p>
                        <p>Probably the most important subject that calls for consideration at this
                            time in connection with Far Eastern matters is that of giving concrete
                            evidence of this country’s intention and capacity to deliver in China
                            materials of war. This is important because it has a definite bearing on
                            the problem of keeping China actively in line as a fighting member of
                            the United Nations group. That is a political question. <pb n="10" xml:id="pg_10" facs="0020"/>It is important now because the American
                            people and the American Congress (to say nothing of the Chinese) are
                            becoming increasingly worried, impatient and insistent about it. That is
                            a political matter. It is especially important at just this moment
                            because of the presence of Madame Chiang as a guest of the President and
                            Mrs. Roosevelt and because of the probability that Dr. T. V. Soong will
                            arrive here in the very near future. Those also are matters of
                            political, important political import.</p>

                        <p>Toward delivering in China materials of war, the thing that would
                            probably be at this time easiest of execution physically would be to
                            send additional transport planes, with cargoes of machine guns, other
                            equipment, and ammunition. Next easiest would be the sending of
                            additional bomber planes. Third easiest would be the sending of
                            additional fighter planes, and spare parts, miscellaneous equipment and
                            ammunition—for the reinforcing of the U. S. A. A. F. which is under the
                            command of General Chennault.</p>
                        <p>Something ought to be done, also, toward straightening out the rivalry
                            and confusion which appears to exist among the higher command personnel
                            of the American armed forces operating in the Assam-China theater. If
                            the President is not familiar with the details of that situation, it
                            might be helpful were he to call for a complete and objective report on
                            the subject.</p>

                    <p>242. Embassy has learned that British are sending to China a group of five
                        officers headed by a Vice Air Marshal (Major General) to instruct Chinese
                        aviators in the air training school at Chengtu in tactics as distinguished
                        from flight training. The group now en route is expected in China soon. It
                        is understood that Chinese first approached us for such instructors and
                        accepted British instructors only after they had been informed that we could
                        not comply.</p>
                    <p>There have been until recently several hundred British air ground crew
                        personnel in Chengtu but this number has now been reduced radically by
                        transfer from China. Personnel originally evacuated to China after fall of
                        Burma.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Foreign Minister, Dr. T. V. Soong, called at his request. I
                        welcomed him back from his protracted visit to Chungking and proceeded to
                        tell him what a marvelous impression his sister, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, had
                        made on everyone in this country.</p>
                    <p>I then referred to the conclusion of the negotiations on
                            extraterritoriality<note n="12" xml:id="d9fn12">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_690">p. 690</ref>.</note> and thanked him for his fine
                        aid in the matter at the other end of the line. He replied with many
                        expressions of gratitude at our course. He said that the abandonment of
                        extraterritoriality practices could not have been accomplished without the
                        leadership of this Government and that our British friends were a little
                        less enthusiastic about such matters than the United States.</p>
                    <p>I referred to the deep and constant interest the State Department has taken
                        in its efforts to cooperate with the Chinese Government in securing military
                        and other supplies from this country. He said he was aware of this and was
                        most appreciative. I then suggested that he give the State Department copies
                        of his lists of requested supplies which he presents to the appropriate
                        departments of the Government in order that we might be of more effective
                        assistance.</p>
                    <p>I inquired about economic, financial and military conditions in China. He
                        said he would like to go into these matters at some length when I return
                        from my vacation.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister added that Japan seemed to be poising herself for an
                        important movement of some kind and that, taking all the circumstances and
                        facts into consideration, he was inclined to believe that it was intended
                        more against China than against any other power.</p>
                    <p>I said to Dr. Soong that a person now and then would inquire of me as to
                        Russia’s intentions after the war, both in the East and in the West. The
                        Foreign Minister replied that Russia was saying nothing in this connection
                        so far as he was aware (this evidently means to other Chinese Government
                        officials). I added that now and then someone would inquire about Russia’s
                        possible intentions toward Korea. He promptly replied that he did not know
                        about this, that he only knew China’s intentions which were opposed to <pb n="12" xml:id="pg_12" facs="0022"/>taking over new territory, whether it
                        be Korea, Burma, Indochina or other outlying areas. He said that his
                        Government saw eye to eye with this Government on the question of annexing
                        territory and is dead against it.</p>
                    <p>I briefly reviewed for Dr. Soong’s information the high points in our
                        relations with Japan during the one or two years leading up to the attack on
                        Pearl Harbor, including the constant requests of the British, the
                        Australians, the Dutch and our own Army and Navy heads that we at the State
                        Department and the White House not allow ourselves to be drawn into a war
                        with Japan until it was absolutely necessary for the reason that all of them
                        said they were not ready. I also reminded the Foreign Minister of many of
                        the factual phases of that long period of conversations with Japan which I
                        had conducted.<note n="13" xml:id="d9fn13">See <ref target="frus1941v04#pg_1">

                        seemed very appreciative and expressed himself as most pleased to get the

                        time. He said that the State Department stood one hundred percent high with
                        everyone wherever he had been.</p>
                    <p>I reminded Dr. Soong that we set forth almost all of the principles at

                        treaty with China had been planned by this Government for the past two or
                        three years, as a part and parcel of the good neighbor policy launched at
                        Montevideo, but that on account of conditions prevailing as a result of the
                        Chinese and Japanese conflict it had been difficult to bring our Marines out
                        of Shanghai, Peking and Nanking. The Foreign Minister seemed greatly
                        interested in this information.</p>

                        to armed forces and people of Thailand February 26.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Since the signing of treaty of alliance between Thailand and Japan, I
                            have not spoken to you because I realized your difficulties and knew
                            your circumstances to be not unlike those of China before we resisted
                            Japan in 1937. Now circumstances have changed, the Axis powers are being
                            forced to take the defensive, the day for you to save your country is
                            drawing near and I desire to speak to you frankly in order to show
                            China’s feeling toward you.</p>
                        <p>Chinese friendship for Thailand is based on historical background, upon 3
                            million compatriots living in Thailand and upon Chinese realization that
                            Japanese-Thai alliance was not expression of free will of Thai soldiers
                            and people. China’s faith as nation is based upon Three People’s
                            Principles which call for freedom and equality for all nations. China
                            signed United Nations Declaration<note n="16a" xml:id="d11fn17">United
                                Nations Declaration, January 1, 1942, Department of State Executive
                                Agreement Series No. 236, or 55 Stat. 1600.</note> with this faith.
                            I can give my solemn word that China as well as her Allies have no
                            territorial ambitions in Thailand and harbor no intentions of
                            undermining her sovereignty and independence. China’s war policy is to
                            crush the Japanese war machine and Thailand is considered as enemy
                            occupied territory under that policy, not as enemy country. Thai army
                            and people should, therefore, cooperate with China to expel enemy from
                            both countries. We earnestly expect you now to do your duty promptly for
                            salvation of your country and whole world and we hope you will regain
                            international confidence your <pb n="14" xml:id="pg_14" facs="0024"/>country once enjoyed and achieve right to speak for your country in

                    <p>Without offering any comment as to the merits of the Indian situation and how
                        best to deal with it, Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Government naturally
                        view the Indian situation with serious concern. If the situation there
                        disintegrates, China will regard that development, first, as an evidence of
                        failure of British leadership and, second, as an evidence of disinclination
                        or inability on the part of the United States Government to press upon the
                        British Government the views of the American public. This is simply an
                        objective statement of how the Chinese would regard any such development. It
                        is obvious that such Chinese reaction to such a contingency would be
                        seriously harmful to the cause of the United Nations.</p>

                        <item>There are many indications that a substantial number of articulate and
                            influential Chinese feel that the war is being conducted as an
                            American-British affair. Toward remedying this situation it is believed
                            important that greater efforts be made in various fields to cause the
                            Chinese to realize that they are full and important partners in the
                            common war effort.</item>

                            Common Victory.</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>It is important that the victory achieved by the United Nations against Japan
                        should be a common victory and not a victory achieved by any one of the
                        United Nations. Future peace and stability in the Far East depend to a large
                        measure as in other areas of the world on cooperative relationships among
                        nations based upon liberal, progressive principles. Should China alone be
                        chiefly responsible for victory against Japan, the tendency would be for
                        China to adopt individualistic, nationalistic policies rather than
                        cooperative, broad-gauge policies. Should the United States be chiefly
                        responsible for victory against Japan, similar results might be anticipated.
                        Should Great Britain be chiefly responsible, similar results might be
                        anticipated. Should the Soviet Union join the war against Japan and be
                        chiefly responsible for victory against Japan, similar results might be
                        anticipated. It is thus highly important that the general situation relating
                        to conduct of the war against Japan be not permitted to develop in such a
                        way that Japan’s defeat be accomplished by the effort of one alone of the
                        United Nations. Victory over Japan should come from a common effort, each
                        country contributing its maximum.</p>

                    <p>At dinner last evening with the Generalissimo, I informed him that I had
                        received a message from Washington asking me to come home for consultation,
                        and commented that I had not been in the United States since my country had
                        entered the war and it seemed desirable therefore that I get into personal
                        contact with the Government.</p>
                    <p>Generalissimo Chiang expressed interest and asked me when I would be leaving.
                        I replied that I had not yet made definite arrangements and that I did not
                        feel that I could do so until I had his permission to leave. He acknowledged
                        the courtesy, and interposed no objection to my leaving.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="pg_16" facs="0026"/>
                    <p>During the course of our conversation throughout dinner he asked me to convey
                        his respects to the President, and to Mr. Hull and Mr. Welles. He asked me
                        particularly to say to Mr. Hull and Mr. Welles that he deeply and sincerely
                        appreciated their friendly attitude toward China and their desire to place
                        relations between the United States and China on a basis of equality and
                        reciprocity; and he appreciated the speed with which steps were taken to
                        give effect to that desire in the negotiation of the recent treaty.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo also during the conversation referred to Ambassador Grew
                        and his “Report from Tokyo”. He said that he admired Ambassador Grew and he
                        wished me when I saw Mr. Grew to express to him that admiration.</p>
                    <p>I referred in courteous commendation to the Generalissimo’s recent message to
                            Thailand.<note n="19" xml:id="d13fn19">See telegram No. 293, February
                            27, from the Ambassador in China, <ref target="#pg_13">p.
                            13</ref>.</note> He was pleased; and said that I might report to Mr.
                        Hull that the Thai troops have been in contact with the Chinese and have
                        said that they do not intend to fight the Chinese; when the time comes they
                        will be on China’s side. I commented that I wondered whether the same would
                        not hold true for example as to the Koreans that the Japanese are recruiting
                        and the Manchurian troops (I refrained from referring to the Wang Ching-wei
                        puppet troops); that at the proper moment they would turn against the
                        Japanese. The Generalissimo agreed.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of Japanese-Russian relations, I sounded out the Generalissimo as to
                        whether he believed that Japan was still likely to attack Russia, saying
                        that we have heard of course, as had he, that Germany has been urging Japan
                        to attack in Siberia. The Generalissimo said that he still believed that
                        such an attack might be made; and in reply to my inquiry as to whether Japan
                        has sufficient reserve strength to give to an offensive against Russia the
                        Generalissimo said that he believed that Japan has sufficient reserve
                        strength; he agreed however that it would be a fatal move on the part of
                        Japan and said it would shorten the war.</p>
                    <p>He then made the comment that Russia likely would have been in the war
                        against Japan before this if there had been closer cooperation politically
                        among the United Nations. He felt, he said, that there should be closer
                        political cooperation. I asked whether the Pacific war council at Washington
                        did not give opportunity for exchange of views on these subjects. He
                        admitted that it did give some opportunity.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of Madame Chiang’s visit to the United States, the Generalissimo
                        asked me to express his appreciation of the cordiality of her reception,
                        etc., etc. He commented that he was concerned as to Madame Chiang’s health;
                        whether the demands on her were not too <pb n="17" xml:id="pg_17" facs="0027"/>heavy. I laughingly commented that the Americans are very
                        much like the Chinese toward their visitors; they welcome them strenuously,
                        and sometimes the programs are too extensive; Madame Chiang should not
                        accept invitations beyond her strength and should be firm in declining too
                        heavy a burden.</p>
                    <p>When I took leave of the Generalissimo, he expressed the hope that I would
                        return to Chungking soon.</p>

                    <p>China is now represented on only two important United Nations
                        organizations—(1) Pacific War Council, (2) United Nations Information Board.
                        China also has limited liaison with the Combined Chiefs of Staff. The
                        Chinese Military Attaché maintains an office in the Combined Chiefs of Staff
                        Building and participates in some meetings of a general character.</p>
                    <p>The Pacific War Council is devoted almost entirely to an informal exchange of
                        views and information among the persons participating in the meetings. The
                        President usually reports on events of interest to those present. The United
                        Nations Information Board is not an organization concerned with the
                        day-by-day conduct of psychological warfare and is of relatively small
                        importance in the general picture.</p>
                    <p>Among the more important organizations established by the United Nations to
                        deal with various phases of the war there may be listed the following:</p>
                    <p>[Here follows list of 26 United Nations organizations, together with
                        “purpose” and “nations represented.” For a similar list, see Department of
                        State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, January 16, 1943, pages 66–78.]</p>
                    <p>From a study of the foregoing organizations there emerges plainly the fact
                        that in all of the more important organizations the United States and Great
                        Britain have almost exclusive representation, with the exception of those
                        organizations primarily devoted to problems involving this hemisphere. At
                        the same time, a study of the purposes of these organizations makes clear
                        that such membership is founded on good reasons. The United States and Great
                        Britain have the most to give and are giving the most in regard to the
                        supplies dealt with in most of the committees or organizations.
                        Nevertheless, it remains <pb n="18" xml:id="pg_18" facs="0028"/>obvious that
                        China is not represented on joint organizations to handle problems in
                        connection with the war in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>There is considerable evidence to indicate that important sections of Chinese
                        opinion both official and private regard the strategic planning and conduct
                        of the war of the United Nations against the Axis countries as an
                        American-British operation. This feeling is detrimental to the cooperative
                        efforts of the United States and China against Japan. If allowed to continue
                        it may become dangerous. Persons in China holding the conviction that war
                        strategy is now purely Anglo-American feel strongly that China should be
                        accepted as an “equal partner”. In support of this contention they cite
                        China’s past contributions and China’s future potentialities. Such persons
                        argue that strategy against the enemy Japan cannot be plotted and be
                        executed to maximum advantage unless full use is made of the resources and
                        experience of each country at war with Japan. In the light of China’s
                        geographical position, vast manpower and what they regard as China’s war
                        potential, they feel that China deserves to be represented on and heard in
                        the highest councils.</p>
                    <p>There is growing evidence that the views outlined in the foregoing paragraph
                        are coming to be accepted by an increasing number of members of Congress and
                        private persons in this country.</p>
                    <p>The role which China and Chinese manpower and resources is to play in the
                        crushing of Japan is primarily a military problem to be decided by competent
                        military authorities. The time at which comprehensive staff discussions and
                        planning between the highest military authorities of all forces which are to
                        participate in the offensive drive against Japan should occur is also a
                        matter to be decided by the competent military authorities. There are,
                        however, important political considerations affecting not only present
                        relations between the United States and China but also the long future of
                        American relations with and American interests in countries of the Pacific
                        area which make it important that prompt consideration be given to the
                        question of bringing about on the part of China a feeling of partnership in
                        the war of the United Nations against the Axis countries. One method might
                        be to take the necessary steps to bring about more active participation by
                        China in United Nations organizations at the earliest possible date.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested, therefore, that our thought should be directed constantly
                        and intensively toward establishing at the earliest practicable time such
                        organizations as may be desirable and feasible (1) to convince the Chinese
                        of their increasing participation in war planning and execution of
                        operations and (2) to contribute to the achievement of United States policy
                        in the Pacific designed, first, totally to defeat <pb n="19" xml:id="pg_19" facs="0029"/>the enemy in the shortest possible time and, second, to
                        create conditions of long-range stability and orderly evolution in the
                        Pacific area. Membership in such organizations, some of which might sit in
                        Chungking and some in Washington, might include representatives of the
                        United States and China and such others of the United Nations as might be
                        desired both by the United States and China.</p>
                    <p>Chinese membership on many existing organizations might not be desirable or
                        feasible. It is felt, however, that much good might be accomplished by the
                        creation of new organizations in some instances similar in scope and purpose
                        to existing organizations devoted to like problems in areas other than China
                        and the Far East. In this connection, reference is made to the existing
                        organizations listed above.</p>
                    <p>For example, there might now be established to advantage a Pacific
                        Intelligence Board which would (1) take over the functions of the United
                        Nations Information Board as they may pertain to the Pacific, (2) establish
                        close cooperation between the United States and China in the gathering,
                        exchange and dissemination of all forms of military, economic and political
                        intelligence with respect to the Pacific area, and (3) develop and put into
                        operation a well-coordinated program of psychological warfare against Some
                        may argue that establishment of an of organization of this nature would be
                        undesirable for the reasons that such a board might tend to color
                        intelligence information, that Chinese information services are biased and
                        not objective, and that in psychological warfare China might press strongly
                        for overemphasis on freedom and independence for non-self-governing peoples
                        in the Pacific area, including areas under the sovereignty of other United
                        Nations. It is submitted, nevertheless, that in addition to the
                        psychological advantages—such as stimulation of China’s sense of
                        participation and responsibility and enhancement of the United Nations’
                        cause in the eyes of the peoples of the Pacific area—the establishment of an
                        organization of this sort could produce practical results of material
                        benefit to the war effort. The Chinese will continue their intelligence and
                        psychological activities. These activities could be more readily tempered,
                        coordinated and integrated with our own similar efforts through a board of
                        this sort than could be accomplished through the present somewhat
                        uncoordinated and individual programs. Establishment of such a board would
                        not, meanwhile, interfere in any way with our present avenues of
                        intelligence both in China and in nearby areas. Membership on a board of
                        this sort would include representatives from the United States and China and
                        such others of the United Nations as might be desirable. The activities of a
                        board of this sort would coordinate and possibly merge <pb n="20" xml:id="pg_20" facs="0030"/>many of the activities of such organizations
                        as BEW, OSS and OWI<note n="21" xml:id="d14fn21">Board of Economic Warfare,
                            Office of Strategic Services, and Office of War Information,
                            respectively.</note> now being carried on in connection with the war
                        against Japan.</p>
                    <p>Among other organizations which suggest themselves there may be noted the
                        following:</p>
                    <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Combined Chiefs of Staff for the Pacific</hi>.
                                Subject, of course, to final decision by the highest military
                                authorities, there may well be established Combined Chiefs of Staff
                                for military operations in the theaters of, first, China, Indochina
                                and Thailand; second, India, Burma and Malaya; and possibly third,
                                Australia, the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines. At the
                                present time Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is the United Nations’
                                Commander-in-Chief in the first theater, General Wavell is the
                                United Nations’ Commander-in-Chief in the second theater, and
                                General MacArthur is the United Nations’ Commander-in-Chief in the
                                third theater. General Stilwell, who is Chief of Staff to the
                                Generalissimo in the latter’s United Nations command, is also the
                                Commanding General of all United States forces in India, Burma and
                                China and the Commanding General of all United States forces in the
                                “Asiatic theater”. The creation of a Combined Chiefs of Staff for
                                the Pacific would be designed to facilitate full coordination of all
                                efforts in three adjacent theaters of war, in all of which
                                operations against Japan are being conducted.</p>
                            <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">United States–China Supply Council</hi>. There
                                might be established an organization with representation from at
                                least the United States and China similar in scope and purpose to
                                the already established Allied Supply Council. The Allied Supply
                                Council has United States and Australian membership and has the
                                purpose “to coordinate plans and advise on supplies available from
                                Australian sources”. A council of the sort envisaged might well
                                contribute to the solution of the difficult problem of supplies
                                within China necessary for military operations. For example,
                                something might be worked out to our mutual advantage in regard to
                                transportation facilities, petroleum development, food stores, et
                                cetera. At present these problems are dealt with separately by
                                various Chinese organizations and by United States Army and other
                                United States officials concerned.</p>
                            <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Combined Production and Resources Board</hi>.
                                    While at the moment the need for a board of this sort may not
                                    appear to be great, it is submitted that such an organization
                                    with possibly representatives from India sitting with United
                                    States and China representatives could go far to “complete the
                                    organizations needed for the most effective use of the combined
                                    resources” available from the United States, India and China in
                                    the prosecution of the war.</p>
                                <p>The creation of a board of this sort would have important
                                    psychological advantages in that it would include membership of
                                    both Indians and Chinese.</p>
                                <p>Such a board might also make significant practical contribution.
                                    The press has recently attributed to Mr. Stettinius, Lend-Lease
                                    Administrator, the prediction that Lend-Lease assistance to
                                    India would be “much more extended” for the reason that United
                                    States experts <pb n="21" xml:id="pg_21" facs="0031"/>believe
                                    that India, if properly developed, could supply the entire
                                    Burma–China–India front. In this connection, there was
                                    attributed to Dr. Henry F. Grady<note n="22" xml:id="d14fn22">Former Assistant Secretary of State; president of American

                                    had the tools and its labor were trained, India could supply
                                    Burma and China as well as itself. India is now the second

                                present time the United Nations, especially the United States, are
                                receiving limited amounts of important raw materials from China.
                                Information with regard to the availability of such materials and
                                ways and means for their procurement, shipment and utilization are
                                at present handled by several organizations both in this country and
                                in China. On the part of the United States there are (1) Metals
                                Reserve Company, handling all metals, (2) Defense Supplies
                                Corporation, handling bristles, silk, et cetera, and (3) BEW, which
                                has sent “shipping expediters”, mining experts, et cetera, to China.
                                In China there are (1) National Resources Commission, handling all
                                minerals, (2) semiofficial Foo Shing Company, handling bristles,

                                organizations involved. It is believed that creation of a

                                beneficial psychological effect and might contribute to increased

               </p>
                    <p>To evaluate the arguments both pro and contra it is probably necessary to
                        know whether operations against Japan are to be accelerated and expanded on
                        a considerable scale in the relatively near future. If United States forces,
                        with such assistance as might be available from other United Nations, are to
                        undertake soon extensive operations against Japan, it would seem that the
                        arguments pro are stronger than the arguments contra. If on the other hand
                        the time is not yet ripe for operations of this sort, the arguments contra
                        would seem to be stronger than the arguments pro. In this latter event the
                        Chinese are bound to be disappointed whether or not they have membership on
                        a board plotting grand strategy. The question resolves itself, therefore,
                        primarily into a psychological one: whether the degree of disappointment on
                        the part of the Chinese will be greater if they are present and must be told
                        that operations of the nature which they desire are not feasible or if they
                        are not present and subsequently observe that operations which they desire
                        are not carried out. It is to be pointed out at the same time that highest
                        decisions of grand strategy are for the most part made at personal meetings
                        between such high leaders as President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill,
                        President Roosevelt and Mr. Molotov,<note n="23" xml:id="d14fn23">V. M.
                            Molotov, Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs.</note> Mr. Churchill and

                        rank.</p>
                    <p>Quite apart from the question of a new strategy board, it is believed that
                        the political desiderata involved—including (1) China’s present and post-war
                        attitude, (2) the offsetting of racial animosities in the Far East and
                        especially in India, and (3) the development of conditions conducive to
                        stability and orderly evolution in the Pacific area—make it a matter of
                        importance that steps be taken directed toward giving China a greater
                        feeling of joint participation in the war against the Axis countries.</p>

                    <p>If the foregoing suggestions meet with approval, it is suggested that Mr.
                        Welles at one of his regular liaison meetings with General <pb n="23" xml:id="pg_23" facs="0033"/>Marshall<note n="25" xml:id="d14fn25">Gen.

                        Pacific Intelligence Board (see page 6 <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>). Should
                        General Marshall and Admiral King approve, this question might then be taken
                        up with officials of BEW, OWI and OSS, and the project coordinated and put
                        into shape for presentation to the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that Mr. Welles might also discuss with General Marshall and
                        Admiral King the question of the possible creation of a Combined Chiefs of
                        Staff for the Pacific (see page 7 <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>).</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Welles approves, it is suggested that he ask Mr. Acheson to discuss
                        with officials of BEW, Metals Reserve Company, Defense Supplies Corporation,
                        and other interested agencies of this Government the question of the
                        establishment of a United States–China Supply Council, a Combined Production
                        and Resources Board, and a Combined Raw Materials Board (see pages 7–8 <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>).</p>
                    <p>We believe that the steps which have been suggested would be helpful in
                        achieving the broad-gauge political objectives of associating China more
                        closely with our own war and post-war efforts, of offsetting racial
                        animosities in the Far East and especially in India, and of developing
                        conditions conducive to stability and orderly evolution in the Pacific area.
                        We believe also that such steps would contribute measurably to the war

                        year the Chinese Embassy here discussed with us the question of the issuance
                        by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of a statement in regard to Thailand. We
                        made a few suggestions to the Embassy in regard to the proposed statement
                        and also informed the Embassy that if General Chiang should issue the
                        statement this Government would expect to take an informal occasion to make
                        an appropriate supporting statement.</p>
                    <p>On February 26 there was broadcast a message from the Generalissimo to the
                        “Soldiers and citizens of Thailand.” A copy of the text of the broadcast, as
                        given in the February 27 issue of the Chinese News Service, is

                        called to our attention the fact that the Generalissimo had made this
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>In the light of the whole situation, it is believed that it would be
                        generally helpful and that the Chinese Government would appreciate it if you
                        could make a supporting statement at an early press conference. There is
                        attached a draft statement<note n="28" xml:id="d15fn28">It read: “Proposed
                            Statement—to be made orally and informally—not for quotation. The

                            citizens of Thailand is in accord with the principles of the Atlantic
                            Charter of August 14, 1941, and of the Declaration by United Nations of
                            January 1, 1942—no aggrandizement, territorial or otherwise. The
                            Government of the United States believes that the people of Thailand are
                            opposed to the Japanese occupation of their country. The Government of
                            the United States continues to recognize the Minister of Thailand to the
                            United States.”</note> which you might care to use. It is suggested that

                        respect to the Pacific area, and toward developing and putting into
                        operation an adequately coordinated program of psychological warfare against
                        Japan, and toward cultivation of mutual confidence among those of the Allied
                        nations that have particular interest and concern in and regarding the Far
                        East, substantial advantage might be derived from the establishing of a
                        board or committee in the membership of which there would be included
                        representatives as follows: United States, New Zealand, Australia, the

                        intelligence information because of the bias and special interests of the

                        not impossible, to harmonize all the views held by the various
                        representatives as a result of their individual interests. It is submitted,
                        nevertheless, that the establishment of an organization of this sort would
                        have important psychological advantages such as (1) abatement of the present
                        feeling which many of these peoples hold strongly of being “left out of” the
                        planning and execution of war activities; (2) stimulation of a sense of
                        participation and responsibility on the part of the various peoples
                        represented; (3) enhancement of the cause of the United Nations in the eyes
                        of the peoples in the Pacific area. In addition, the establishment of such
                        an organization might produce practical results of material benefit to the
                        war effort. The various nations concerned will undoubtedly continue their
                        present intelligence and psychological activities. These activities could,
                        it is believed, be more readily tempered, coordinated and integrated, thus
                        achieving maximum advantage, through a board of this sort than could be
                        accomplished through the present somewhat uncoordinated and individual
                        programs.</p>
                    <p>The creation of a board of this sort might bring together and possibly merge
                        many of the activities of the various organizations now functioning under
                        each of the governments involved in connection with the war against
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the establishment of such a board would be helpful toward
                        achieving broad-gauge political objectives of associating the countries
                        primarily interested in the Pacific more closely in the common war effort,
                        of off-setting racial animosities in the Pacific, and of developing
                        conditions conducive to long-term stability and orderly evolution in the
                        Pacific area. We believe also that a step of this nature would contribute
                        measurably to the war effort.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">The Stilwell Mission</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>General Stilwell came to China in February 1942 with a directive from the
                        President to keep China in the war and to do everything possible to increase
                        China’s military contribution to the joint struggle against the Axis.</p>
                    <p>A fundamental difficulty which faces General Stilwell is that China’s policy
                        in the prosecution of this war is not always parallel to ours.</p>
                    <pb n="26" xml:id="pg_26" facs="0036"/>
                    <p>All informed Chinese are keenly aware that of the four principal members of
                        the United Nations, China has suffered the longest and the greatest in this
                        conflict. Furthermore like the Russians and the British, the Chinese have a
                        more highly developed political sense than we. Political considerations loom
                        larger in their evaluation of situations (including the military situation)
                        than they do for even the Russians and the British.</p>
                    <p>Acutely aware of their relative military exhaustion, of the fact that they
                        can be no stronger politically than they are militarily, of the importance
                        of appearing as powerful as possible at the peace table and of the
                        likelihood of civil war with the Chinese communists after the peace, the
                        Chinese Government is, not surprisingly, pursuing a policy of conservation
                        of military strength. The Japanese approach the truth when they accuse the
                        Chinese of seeking to make the far (the United States) fight the near
                        (Japan).</p>
                    <p>We recognized before December 7, 1941 that China was endeavoring to get us to
                        fight its battle against Japan. There has been no reason for a change in
                        this Chinese attitude and there has in fact been no change, despite the
                        disillusioning shock of Pearl Harbor which struck the Chinese with as great
                        force as it did us.</p>
                    <p>China’s policy, now that we are fighting the Japanese, is to remain
                        technically in the war so as to be able to sit at the peace table as a
                        “fighting” ally, to expend as little as possible of its strength and to rely
                        upon the other members of the United Nations—primarily the United States—to
                        defeat Japan.</p>
                    <p>We have not bled enough for the liking of the Russians, the British or the
                        Chinese. With political considerations looming so large in their
                        calculations they are each fighting not only the common enemies but also, in
                        a negative fashion, their allies.</p>
                    <p>A second fundamental difficulty confronting General Stilwell is that, in
                        addition to his professional military task, he is involved, whether he likes
                        it or not, in Chinese domestic politics. He is a major force in Chinese
                        politics. By instinct, temperament and convictions, he seeks to avoid
                        involvement in Chinese domestic politics. But the fact that he commands a
                        military force in China, is empowered to issue orders in the Generalissimo’s
                        name and has under his control lend-lease matériel for distribution to China
                        makes him, despite all of his wishes to the contrary, a Chinese political
                        factor. While he endeavors to avoid playing domestic politics, he cannot
                        prevent politics from being played on him.</p>
                    <p>In his efforts to short-circuit domestic politics, General Stilwell has as
                        much as possible dealt directly with the Generalissimo. But the
                        Generalissimo maintains his paramount position as he attained it—through
                        political manipulation. He is not a dictator. He has no <pb n="27" xml:id="pg_27" facs="0037"/>absolute over-all command. He manipulates a
                        delicate and shifting balance of power. So there is no one with sure and
                        final authority with whom General Stilwell can deal.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell has, of course, had long-standing contact with the Chinese
                        Army. What he discovered upon his arrival at Chungking was therefore no
                        surprise to him. The Chinese Army is not an army in the sense that we use
                        the word army. Rather it is an agglomerate of feudalistic military forces
                        held more or less together by personal loyalties, endowments, grants in aid,
                        threats of superior weight and indifferent toleration. The Generalissimo’s
                        relation to this armed mass is variable. A few divisions he can count upon
                        to obey his orders fairly faithfully, within the limits of their ability.
                        Others, no. He wisely does not attempt to issue to some of the more
                        independent commanders orders which he has reason to believe they would not
                        be willing to obey. Many orders are issued only after negotiation with the
                        commander or his Chungking representative.</p>
                    <p>The following comment by an exceptionally intelligent Chinese Army officer
                        reveals a good deal with regard to the Chinese scale of military values. We
                        were discussing possible candidates for the command of the Chinese Army at
                        Ramgarh. I mentioned General Sun, Commander of the 38th Division, an
                        unusually capable officer (I knew he would not be acceptable, but was
                        interested in what reply would be given). It was this—”General Sun is too
                        young, he belongs to no strong faction and has no political history.”</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Army is not only badly organized and, as everyone knows, poorly
                        equipped but is also meagrely trained. This has shown up glaringly at
                        Ramgarh. From privates on up, with exceptions like General Sun.</p>
                    <p>Excepting for the Communist divisions and the small body of troops at
                        Ramgarh, the morale of the Chinese Army is low. It is characterized by (1)
                        apathy and (2) venality.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Army Officers have no great interest in fighting the Japanese.
                        Even at Ramgarh there is some evidence of this. A Chinese-speaking American
                        officer there who has constant contact with Chinese officers expressed
                        surprise that not one of his Chinese colleagues (many of whom had homes
                        occupied by the Japanese) had expressed a desire to get into the field and
                        fight the Japanese. In China, the situation is worse.</p>
                    <p>Venality in the Chinese Army goes along naturally with the apathy, Chinese
                        troops have traditionally had to shift for themselves. Most units have lived
                        off the localities in which they have been stationed. This situation has
                        further deteriorated in most regions bordering Japanese-occupied territory.
                        Chinese commanders in these areas have settled down with their wives and
                        families and gone into trade. They <pb n="28" xml:id="pg_28" facs="0038"/>control and profit enormously from the contraband traffic across the
                        “fighting” lines.</p>
                    <p>For example, a British sabotage unit in Hunan sought to destroy a bridge
                        between the lines and over which the Chinese and Japanese were trading. When
                        the Chinese commander heard of the project, he ordered the British out,
                        suggesting that they go and fight their own war—everything was peaceful and
                        harmonious there and the British wanted to start trouble. At Hokow on the
                        Yunnan–Indochina border there is lively traffic between Chinese and
                        Japanese-held territory, a certain number of ferries moving across the
                        dividing river between certain hours. The Chinese garrisons draw their rice
                        rations from Japanese territory. One morning late in January the rice ration
                        failed to arrive during the scheduled trips. The Chinese commander became
                        incensed and entered a strongly worded protest. The Japanese, not wishing to
                        disrupt relations, obligingly dispatched the rations by a special ferry
                        after hours.</p>
                    <p>These are samples chosen at random of the state of affairs at the front. The
                        Japanese are as corrupt as the Chinese. The difference, however, is that the
                        Japanese can be depended upon to fight when the orders come from the top.
                        Corruption has not yet enervated them.</p>
                    <p>Summing up, in seeking to carry out the directive given him, General Stilwell
                        is confronted with a basic reluctance on the part of the Chinese Government
                        to assume the offensive against Japan, (2) a Chinese inclination to rely
                        upon the United States to defeat Japan, (3) a Chinese desire to conserve
                        matériel rather than expend it, (4) attempts by Chinese political factions
                        to use him, (5) the absence of central Chinese authority, whether individual
                        or collective, with whom he can deal, (6) lack of organization, political
                        factionalism, incompetence, apathy and corruption in the Chinese army.</p>
                    <p>It would be naive in the extreme to suggest that all he has to do to make
                        China an aggressive factor in the war against Japan is to place lend-lease
                        arms in Chinese hands and in consultation with the Generalissimo issue
                        orders for the attack.</p>
                    <p>All he can do, in fact, is argue, plead and bargain, with lend-lease matériel
                        and the Ramgarh project as the inducements to follow his lead. The Chinese
                        want the matériel, for that is the stuff of power. And the Chinese generals
                        who have seen Ramgarh want the troops trained there for their personal
                        armies. General Ho Ying-chin<note n="31" xml:id="d17fn31">Chinese Minister
                            of War and Chief of Staff.</note> who was initially chilly to the
                        Ramgarh project has since his visit there displayed signs of covetousness.
                        General Stilwell can and is using these ambitions to compel the Chinese to
                        prepare to assume the offensive against the Japanese.</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="pg_29" facs="0039"/>
                    <p>But the Chinese can be expected to take the offensive only when they are
                        assured that such a venture will be profitable, that what they expend in the
                        way of matériel will be replaced, and with interest. That is one of the
                        costs of an ally. The arrangement is a bargain. And we must continue,
                        through control of the flow of lend-lease equipment, to be in a position to
                        cut off the flow when the Chinese fall down on the fulfillment of their side
                        of the bargain.</p>
                    <p>It follows that the intemperate eulogies of the Chinese Army which appear in
                        the American press and over the American air (largely inspired by the
                        Chinese pressure groups in the United States and uninformed American
                        sinophiles) only play into the hands of the Chinese factions wishing to
                        obtain lend-lease equipment without restrictions as to its use (or non-use).
                        It is scarcely necessary to note that any one whom the Chinese might suggest
                        as a replacement of General Stilwell would be likely to be a man whom the
                        group in power in Chungking believed they could use to their own advantage.
                        In feeling this way the Chinese are neither contemptible nor vicious—merely
                        political.</p>
                    <p>Chinese and Americans have criticized General Stilwell for getting on badly
                        with the Chinese. General Stilwell is not a man who willingly compromises.
                        He has not concealed from the Chinese what he thinks of their incompetence
                        and corruption. Naturally many of them have thereby been offended.</p>
                    <p>My reaction to this criticism is this. The Chinese Army and Government is
                        ridden by politics and abuses. Any American military man who attempted to
                        compromise and play Chinese politics would promptly find himself enmeshed
                        and rendered useless for the purpose he was sent out. General Stilwell once
                        said to me that “My safest course is straight down the road”. I am inclined
                        to agree. The Chinese Army is not going to be made to fight the Japanese by
                        wheedling and open-handed grants of matériel.</p>
                    <p>China is badly in need of the Puritan spirit. The Chinese have not produced
                        it themselves excepting, in a modified form, in the Generalissimo. If the
                        Chinese Army is to be regenerated, it must be through General Stilwell. What
                        he says sometimes stings the Chinese. But it has not gone wholly
                        unappreciated. More than a score of high-ranking Chinese officers have come
                        to him privately telling him that he was doing China a great service by his
                        forthrightedness, that he is needed, and to keep on going straight down the
                        road. And as has been said, even his political enemies have been impressed
                        by what he has in six months produced at Ramgarh. He may yet perform what
                        has seemed impossible—cause the launching of a Chinese offensive against the
                        Japanese. If it happens it will have been a one man achievement.</p>

                                24</ref>.</note> by FE, is essentially self-explanatory. FE proposes
                        the creation of a board or committee the function of which shall be to
                        handle intelligence data with regard to the Pacific area in a manner
                        adequately attentive to the political aspects of the relationships which
                        prevail among or which need to be cultivated among those of the Allied
                        nations that are especially and directly concerned with developments in the
                        Pacific and Far Eastern regions.</p>
                    <p>The question of political relationships during war and looking toward the
                        period that will follow war is a problem involving many angles and a
                        multitude of facets. There is a tendency, in the midst of attention to the
                        paramount problem of making and executing military plans and operations, to
                        overlook or give scant consideration to not a few of these angles and
                        facets—especially those that lie or appear to lie in the realm of the
                        “imponderables” or “intangibles”.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced, from observation, that there is much that is lacking in this
                        Government’s handling of some of the problems wherein there are involved a
                        combination of military, political, psychological and other factors. We are
                        not, it seems to me, making the most of the potentialities of some of our
                        allies, nor are we deriving the maximum of the advantages which are
                        potential in the creation, cultivation and exploitation of the United
                        Nations concept. I believe that we could get a good deal more out of some of
                        our allies by giving a good deal more to them: get more in connection with
                        the war effort and get more in connection with the coming peace effort.

                        there was and is much to what that observer and critic said on that subject.
                        We should cultivate, encourage, make use of and derive advantage from good
                        will on the part of our allies—the little and the middle-sized ones as well
                        as the big ones.</p>
                    <p>The idea developed in FE’s memorandum under reference therefore appeals to me
                        and should, I think, be given careful consideration.</p>
                    <p>From a practical point of view this idea ties in with and might readily be
                        given consideration in connection with a question which had the attention of
                        the J. I. C.<note n="34" xml:id="d18fn34">Joint Intelligence
                            Committee.</note> recently: the question of creating an office or at
                        least appointing a qualified officer to perform the function of improving
                        relations with the military representatives here of the <pb n="31" xml:id="pg_31" facs="0041"/>Netherlands and of China. I am of the
                        opinion that the problem then considered might well be given further
                        consideration, in broader terms than before, in the light of the suggestion
                        offered in FE’s memorandum.</p>
                    <p>If these suggestions appeal to you, you might perhaps care to revive the

                    <p>Mr. Rice was introduced to Dr. Hsü, by Mr. Chu, at a small social function
                        during the course of which they had the conversation related below.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hsü said that the most imminent and serious danger faced by China is
                        financial and economic and that he fears inflation may soon reach a point
                        where the currency system will break down and governmental functions,
                        including national defense, become impossible of performance. He professed
                        to fear that with China out of the war, defeat of Japan by the United States
                        might become impossible. He stated that the defeat of Germany at least in
                        North Africa and possibly in Europe may be necessary or desirable before our
                        full weight is thrown against Japan, but that meanwhile more effective
                        action must be taken on China’s behalf if that country is to be kept in the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rice asked Dr. Hsü how much longer he considers present inflationary
                        tendencies can continue before a collapse in the money economy occurs. He
                        replied that he does not believe it possible to judge this mathematically,
                        that Germany’s position after the first war, for instance, cannot be taken
                        as a basis for judgment because of differences in the economies of the two
                        countries, but that he did think the position might become untenable by the
                        time of the next budget. He added that the Chinese financial economy can be
                        saved only by giving China access to physical goods needed by that country,
                            <pb n="32" xml:id="pg_32" facs="0042"/>and that such goods could not
                        enter China in adequate quantities without the recapture of Burma and the
                        reopening of the Burma Road.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hsü expressed cynicism with regard to the possibility of Burma’s being
                        reoccupied in time to save the situation. At this point Mr. Chu stated that
                        the Chinese authorities hear much of General Stilwell’s plans, but that it
                        seemed very doubtful that they would be implemented. Dr. Hsü held that the
                        Indian situation would be at least materially eased if British troops now in
                        India were to reoccupy Burma, for this would quiet those Indians who desire
                        to be rid of rule by a power which appeared, in view of failure in nearby
                        areas, unable to protect them and whose presence in India might serve to
                        invite attack.</p>
                    <p>At no time did Dr. Hsü indicate a belief that the Chinese Government would
                        consider surrendering to Japan. China, he appears to believe, will fight to
                        the so-called bitter end, but he considers that end much nearer than
                        Americans realize and much more bitter than he himself dares contemplate. He
                        added that he considered that the responsible Chinese have been too reticent
                        and too afraid of hurting American sensibilities and that greater frankness
                        in presenting the true Chinese situation was needed. Mr. Rice stated that
                        possibly Chinese officials have been too reticent with respect to revelation
                        of conditions prevailing within China, but had not been reticent with regard
                        to desire for greater aid from the United States. As an instance, he pointed
                        out that several Chinese officials are lending their names to the <hi rend="italic">China Monthly</hi>, which prints articles demanding
                        increased aid to China and severely criticizing both the Department of State
                        and American foreign policy. Dr. Hsü said he was glad to hear this, which he
                        considered an encouraging manifestation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hsü said he considered the survival of China depends upon the
                        infallibility of a few high American strategists. He criticized President
                        Roosevelt, in this connection, for devoting attention to domestic politics
                        and for leaving questions of strategy to the military. Mr. Rice gave the
                        opinion that the President has devoted much attention to strategical and
                        other questions related to the war, that his deep knowledge of and close
                        attention to naval affairs is well known, and that concern with domestic
                        administration must remain essential to winning the war so long as the
                        United States is an economic and industrial base producing the means of
                        waging war for ourselves and other United Nations.</p>
                    <p>In summary, it might be added that Dr. Hsü revealed an apparent depth of
                        bitterness, with respect to presentday Sino-American relations, which is
                        rarely encountered.</p>

                        attention of the War Department. War Department states that it has no record

                        war-lord and “Christian general”, now member of the Standing Committee of
                        the National Military Council of which General Chiang Kai-shek is Chairman.
                        My friend explained to me that Feng is the only prominent figure in the
                        Government, with the possible exception of Sun Fo, who dares to be bluntly
                        outspoken in his criticism of conditions in China when speaking to the
                        Generalissimo. Feng’s verbal attacks on corruption and incompetence, he
                        said, have earned him the enmity of other officials, both military and
                        civil.</p>
                    <p>With the slight stoop and mental preoccupation of advancing age, Feng stalked
                        into the room, a massive figure in his wadded jacket and trousers of blue
                        cotton. He indulged in the old Chinese courtesies of <pb n="34" xml:id="pg_34" facs="0044"/>referring to himself as “younger brother”
                        and the United States as “your honorable country”. Gradually we got to an
                        exchange of views.</p>
                    <p>He wants a supreme American-Chinese-Soviet command for the war against Japan.
                        He reiterated this. His omission of Britain was pointed; his inclusion of
                        the Soviet Union despite Russia’s neutrality gave him no pause. He demanded
                        a supreme command for the war against the Japanese because, he said, the
                        Burma experience taught us that we need one. The British doling out rice day
                        by day as negotiated for, the haggling over who was in command—the Chinese,
                        the Americans and the British each with his bids—was a disgraceful spectacle
                        of buying and selling (<hi rend="italic">tso mai mai</hi>). This type of
                        bargaining must be replaced by a strong central command. Whether it be
                        American, British or Chinese doesn’t matter, he roared, unity of direction
                        is the important thing.</p>
                    <p>Feeling that we were getting slightly beyond my depth, I ventured a question
                        about the post-war world. That elicited another blast. He was a simple
                        soldier. His only interest was driving the Japanese devils from China back
                        to the islands. He was not speculating on what should happen after that. We
                        had to defeat the enemy first.</p>
                    <p>After this storm had subsided, we talked about American aid to China. He said
                        that he realized that we were doing everything possible under the
                        circumstances. He quoted by way of illustrating Chinese-American relations
                        at this time a Chinese proverb to the effect that a man whose hand is caught
                        between the upper and nether millstones is unreasonably impatient toward the
                        man coming to his aid as fast as is humanly possible.</p>
                    <p>Feng questioned the necessity of our sending arms to China when, as he
                        explained, China was producing more iron and steel than its arsenals and
                        factories could use. It was his belief that we should send over several
                        plane loads of engineers to assist the Chinese in turning the surplus iron
                        and steel into matériel. He was particularly enthusiastic over the
                        possibility of making large mortars which he said had been used by the
                        Russians with great effect. This predilection for mortars may have its base
                        in the demonstration you put on for him some years ago when you (General
                        Stilwell)—according to the legend—constructed a formidable Stokes mortar for
                        him from a piece of iron pipe.</p>
                    <p>Corruption in the Chinese Army was a topic which the General next introduced.
                        He said that due to inflation and the custom of Army and divisional
                        commanders taking a cut on pay allotted to their troops, Chinese divisions
                        are now each one regiment below strength. They still draw pay for full
                        divisions but pocket the allotment for the nonexistent regiments. The
                        Government, he declared, has taken some action with regard to this abuse.
                        The Commanding General of the Third Group Army apparently indulged in this
                        practice to excess, <pb n="35" xml:id="pg_35" facs="0045"/>for he was
                        recently brought to Chungking, according to Feng, for questioning. Feng
                        described this situation with manifest disgust, exclaiming, “That’s one of
                        your allies!”</p>
                    <p>“We are allies”, Feng went on to say, “and we must be frank with one another.
                        You must tell us our faults and recognize our good points.” He continued,
                        “Now is no time to engage in exchange of polite phrases of false mutual
                        esteem. We owe it to one another to be straightforward.” I observed that you
                        had, as far as my information went, been frank with the Generalissimo and
                        other Chinese leaders. Of course, I added, some people had been a little
                        disturbed by straightforward talk. It was a difficult and delicate matter.
                        Feng brushed aside these comments, reemphasizing the necessity for complete
                        frankness.</p>
                    <p>Our mutual friend remarked that I had visited Ramgarh and added, “Mr. Davies
                        says that the troops there have meat to eat every day!” I therefore
                        described conditions at the Training Center, the teaching of practical
                        exercises with live ammunition, the excellent equipment, the good clothing
                        and the robust condition of the troops. Feng nodded approval and then
                        rumbled, “Here, though, if you suggest that the troops should be properly
                        fed and cared for when sick you are called a Communist.”</p>
                    <p>The Japanese had embarked upon a program, Feng stated, for the impressment of
                        10,000,000 Chinese troops (one of those typically picturesque figures of
                        speech statistics to which the Chinese are prone) to be used eventually in
                        the Southwest Pacific and other areas where they will be up against American
                        rather than other Chinese troops. He said that several boatloads have
                        already been sent to Japan and that officers are being trained in Nanking.
                        He said that the American military authorities should secretly confer with
                        the Chinese military authorities to devise means for dealing with this
                        development.</p>
                    <p>The Central Government, our mutual friend declared, had lost contact with the
                        Kiangsu Provincial Government. It was feared that the provincial leaders had
                        gone over to the Japanese. This was being kept secret from us. It
                        represented a serious set-back to Chungking. Other unfavorable developments
                        were the defeat and surrender of the 128th Division (in the Fifth War Area?)
                        and the decimation of Yu Hsueh-chung’s forces in Shantung.</p>
                    <p>Li Tsung-jen, Commander of the Fifth War Area, drew high praise from Feng. He
                        described Li as the best Chinese general and an undoubted patriot. “There is
                        not a person in China who does not regard Li with esteem”, Feng fervently
                        declared. He was scarcely less complimentary about Pai Chung-hsi.</p>
                    <p>This was one of the most interesting conversations I have had in recent
                        months. Feng is a most unusual character, as you well know, <pb n="36" xml:id="pg_36" facs="0046"/>being a combination of shrewd peasant,
                        high-handed warlord, Buddhist recluse, Methodist revivalist, communist
                        internationalist and Chinese nationalist. His conversation was sometimes in
                        the coarse, homely phraseology of the north China farmers, then it was in
                        the form of precepts and moral homilies. At times he was detached, hardly
                        seeming to be aware of my existence, again he was fervent and direct. He was
                        alternately realistic and naive about international and military affairs. He
                        was, however, like most Chinese, consistently anti-British.</p>

                    <p>378. Last night at a dinner given by the Chinese Aeronautical Commission in

                    <p>The addresses and general atmosphere prevailing at the dinner reflected the

                    <p>362. Reference your telegram no. 293, February 27, summarizing a statement of
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to the “soldiers and citizens of
                        Thailand”.</p>
                    <p>At his press conference on March 12 the President made special reference to
                        the Generalissimo’s statement as a matter which he deemed of great value.
                        Referring to the Generalissimo’s statements that China as well as her Allies
                        had no territorial ambitions in Thailand <pb n="37" xml:id="pg_37" facs="0047"/>and harbor no intentions of undermining her sovereignty and
                        independence and that the Thais should recognize the fact that the territory
                        and freedom of Thailand can only be restored to her through the victory of
                        China and her Allies, the President stated that they were a declaration of
                        policy not only of China but of the policy of the United Nations as well.
                        The President emphasized the relation of the Generalissimo’s statement to
                        what he characterized as the general point of view of the United Nations in
                        regard to territory grabbing.</p>

                    <p>391. In an informal discussion Chief of Department of Information, Foreign
                        Office, gave me following interpretation of Tojo’s<note n="42" xml:id="d24fn42">Gen. Hideki Tojo, Japanese Prime Minister.</note>
                        recent visit to Shanghai and Nanking.</p>
                    <p>Purpose was probably twofold. From military standpoint discussions so far
                        have concerned increased use of Nanking puppet troops in order to relieve
                        Japanese troops for transfer either to Manchuria or more likely the South
                        Sea area. Part all-out offensive on China not contemplated, it would seem,
                        but Japanese hope that Chinese puppet troops can be more effectively used
                        against Chinese Government troops. Tojo conferred with Japanese commanders
                        in Nanking and Shanghai. From the political standpoint, visit is interpreted
                        as a matter of face for Wang Ching-wei<note n="43" xml:id="d24fn43">Head of
                            Japanese-sponsored regime at Nanking.</note> and as a gesture to the
                        peoples of Japanese-occupied areas (Burma, Thailand, Philippines, et cetera)
                        indicating the Japanese Government’s friendly and high regard for other
                        oriental governments as one of the tenets of its greater East Asia
                        co-prosperity sphere program.</p>
                    <p>The brevity of Tojo’s visit would indicate that nothing of a concrete and
                        major character could have been discussed and decided upon except by
                        prearrangement and the Embassy inclines to the belief that it was largely a
                        face-making gesture.</p>

                    <p>400. With reference to Embassy’s 394 of March 18, 3 p.m.,<note n="44" xml:id="d25fn44">Not printed.</note> Stewart to Office of War
                        Information, I would comment that the reaction I have encountered among
                        Chinese, mostly official, is one of pleasure over America’s reception of
                        Madame Chiang, satisfaction with the conduct of her visit and confidence
                        that, if it can be gotten, Madame Chiang can get it (this latter with regard
                        to Lend-Lease and other forms of aid to China, to recognition of China’s
                        “rightful position” among United Nations, and to Chinese immigration to the
                        United States). Chinese expectations are high at the moment, as stated in my
                        378, March 16, 4 p.m., in regard to creation of Fourteenth Air Force under
                        Chennault (incidentally there is a tendency to credit Madame Chiang with
                        that development) and there is possibility of adverse reaction if
                        expectations are not fulfilled. Chennault is somewhat perturbed in this
                        respect.</p>
                    <p>On the general subject of support for China, I believe that material aid
                        given should be conditioned upon the theory that it is as much a good will
                        as a military investment, perhaps more so. It should therefore be given in a
                        form most evident to the public.</p>
                    <p>Widespread activity on the part of a strong Fourteenth Air Force under
                        Chennault would fulfill this condition ideally and would be a good military
                        investment as well. There may be additional means of serving the same
                        purpose. Equipment and training of a limited number of Chinese troops as in
                        India and Yunnan may be one of them. But what the Chinese describe as
                        all-out material aid to the Chinese Army to enable it to make an all-out
                        offensive to drive the Japanese out of China would not, it seems most
                        evident, be practical; and aid in a limited and dispersed manner would have
                        no positive effect.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Army is due all credit for its steadfast resistance to Japan and
                        will no doubt when the Japanese become hard pressed take advantage of the
                        situation but we should not permit our appreciation of those facts to lead
                        us to think that material aid now to the Chinese Army would produce results
                        commensurate with the effort with the cost of its diversion and diversion of
                        the transport from other theaters of the war.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, while it is good policy to encourage the Chinese in all practical
                        ways, we need not condition our approach to the problem on any fear that the
                        Chinese might lose confidence in our victory and discontinue resistance.</p>

                    <p>461. Following is summary of Military Attachés<note n="45" xml:id="d27fn45">Col. Morris B. DePass, Jr.</note> review of military situation during
                        past week:</p>
                    <p>The period has been relatively quiet and there are no apparent prospects of
                        an early coordinated military action in the China theatre. Jap broadcast
                        that operations commenced in mid-February in the Yangtze River areas north
                        of Tungting Lake and in the Huai River valley in Northern Kiangsi have been
                        concluded and are now in mopping up stage; reduced activity in those areas
                        confirms broadcast. Chinese military continue to report operations in area
                        of Hwajung, Kungan, and Kingman but they are on small scale. Chinese also
                        report successes in minor engagements in Anhwei and Kwangtung Provinces. In
                        Yunnan there was no significant activity.</p>
                    <p>Chinese intelligence reports that puppet troops have taken over garrison
                        duties at Paotou in Suiyuan Province, Kuwo in Shansi province, and Totseh
                        and Kaocheng in Shantung. This will release regular Jap troops (number
                        stated) for service elsewhere. Appointment of Takuro Matsui as chief of
                        staff of Jap forces in China taken as further indication of Japan’s
                        intention to consolidate position in occupied China and control area insofar
                        as practical with puppet troops. (Embassy recalls that this Matsui is man
                        who prior to 1937 was regarded favorably by Chinese officials at Nanking. He
                        is not the Matsui responsible for the Nanking outrage in 1937.)</p>
                    <pb n="40" xml:id="pg_40" facs="0050"/>
                    <p>Nanking régime and Japs have concluded agreement for return of Peiping
                        Legation Quarter to the Chinese and for rendition of Jap concessions. This
                        and other recent Jap actions indicate desire to strengthen Wang Ching-wei’s
                        authority. Embassy interprets recent Jap civilian and military actions in
                        China as implementation of plan of continuing and strengthening strategic
                        defense position in China through more effective use of Chinese.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Hamilton</hi>: The problem of Chinese representation
                        in United Nations matters is extremely interesting; and serious thought is
                        called for. The blunt fact is that Chinese-British relations are
                        deteriorating to a point where they are in conflict in a number of very
                        important details; and conflict is developing along certain very fundamental
                        lines.</p>
                    <p>Of the suggestions put forward,<note n="46" xml:id="d28fn46">See memorandum
                            of March 5 by the Chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs, <ref target="#pg_17">p. 17</ref>.</note> the most promising at the moment
                        seems to me to be the possibility of a United States-China Supply Council.
                        That is badly needed.</p>

                    <p>I have carefully refrained in China from mixing into our military affairs;
                        they are the duty and responsibility of General Stilwell; but, returning
                        home on leave, I feel that I should mention a matter which has both military
                        and political aspects of some importance—the use of the Chinese air corps
                        pilots trained in the United States.</p>
                    <p>We are bringing several hundred Chinese air corps cadets to the United States
                        annually for advanced training after which they are returned to China and,
                        apparently, have been lost to the war effort. They go into the Chinese air
                        corps under commanders who have not had American training and become more or
                        less inactive. They do not go on from their advanced American training to
                        actual battle experience which they could get in China alongside our own air
                        force; battle experience which would develop them into squadron leaders and
                        assist in building up an efficient Chinese air arm which would be of use to
                        China and of benefit to the United States during the war.</p>
                    <p>I spoke briefly to General Arnold on this subject when he was in Chungking,
                        and I had the impression that the matter was in his opinion worthy of
                        consideration. It was my thought that these pilots after return to China
                        should be brigaded with or alongside our own air force under General
                        Chennault, receive battle experience with them, develop their own squadron
                        leaders, and contribute something to the war effort.</p>
                    <p>I have also talked with Dr. T. V. Soong on the subject, both in Chungking and
                        here, and I am told that China would welcome our interest in developing
                        these pilots and in reorganizing the Chinese air force; and I gain the
                        impression that it would be agreeable to the Chinese if these pilots were
                        brigaded with our air force along some such lines as I have suggested
                        above.</p>
                    <p>When I passed through Kunming on my way home I saw General Chennault and
                        asked him what had been done in the matter. He told me frankly that he had
                        been told by his superior officer (General <pb n="42" xml:id="pg_42" facs="0052"/>Stilwell) not to concern himself in it. Chennault told me
                        that he would like to see these Chinese pilots brigaded alongside his own
                        force, perhaps with American squadron leaders as I have suggested until the
                        Chinese develop their own squadron leaders out of their own contingents, or,
                        he said, his own fliers would gladly agree to the Chinese pilots being mixed
                        into their squadrons.</p>
                    <p>How efficiently and successfully this could be done I do not know, but it
                        seems to me that if any benefit is to come, to us and to China, out of our
                        air corps training program for China something should be done—soon—to make
                        proper use of these American trained Chinese pilots; and the best man to
                        make use of them is Chennault.</p>
                    <p>I have no comment to make on the friction which apparently exists between
                        Chennault and some of his higher military colleagues. I can only say this:
                        Chennault has the complete confidence of the Chinese Government and leaders;
                        he has accomplished wonders with only a handful of planes and pilots; he has
                        produced results in the face of charges that his tactics are unorthodox,
                        etc., etc.; and it would seem to me that having in mind our one
                        objective—winning the war—it would be wise to make all possible use of
                        Chennault in this matter of the Chinese pilots (and indeed, other matters
                        affecting relations between the Chinese and the American forces) if we want
                        results.</p>
                    <p>Confidentially, my conclusion is that the Chinese air corps training program
                        is a failure unless we take these Chinese pilots after their training in the
                        United States, give them battle experience alongside our own air corps,
                        develop Chinese squadron leaders (in short, build up a new Chinese air
                        corps), and get some benefit—for China and for ourselves—out of the program.
                        If we can develop these Chinese pilots in Chennault tactics and make them an
                        effective force we need send less of our own American pilots to China.</p>

                    <p>428. According to Japanese radio broadcasts Premier Tojo in addressing the
                        Diet on March 25 stated <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that “Chungking is
                        feeling a great shock under the recent clear cut measures taken by Japan on

                        Chungking camp sentiments for peace among the front line commanders and that
                        compared to previous times there now is a great increase in the number of
                        those surrendering and returning to the Nanking camp.” In connection with
                        Japanese reports of <pb n="43" xml:id="pg_43" facs="0053"/>alleged
                        defections to the Nanking regime the Chief of the Japanese Army Information

                    <p>There has been growing in my mind for several weeks past a sense of a
                        possibility that long before the time at which, proceeding according to the
                        strategy which has been adopted of defeating Germany first and then dealing
                        with the Japanese, the time will have arrived for the United Nations to
                        attack Japan from points in China, we will find that, in regard to our
                        expectation of using air fields in China, especially fields near the coast,
                        for that attack, we have “missed the boat.” I am not sure that such a
                        situation has not already developed.</p>
                    <p>There come to our attention increasing indications that the Chinese have lost
                        or are losing interest in the idea of further sacrificing on their part
                        toward effecting defeat of Japan. The process of “conciliation” and
                        “pacification” in the occupied areas is proceeding steadily. Trade, directly
                        or indirectly encouraged by the Japanese, between the occupied and the
                        unoccupied areas is increasing. Japanese pressure upon officialdom at
                        Chungking through pressure upon Chinese in Japanese hands seems to be having
                        an effect. Nationalist sentiment, various prejudices, some real and some
                        fancied grievances, some suspicions and some apprehensions—toward and in
                        regard to some of China’s allies in the United Nations group tend to create
                        an apathy among officials at Chungking in regard to the subject of offensive
                        military operations against Japan, in view, first, of the fact that the
                        Japanese are no longer pressing them and are given to striking only when
                        struck, and, second, that the United States and Great Britain <pb n="44" xml:id="pg_44" facs="0054"/>have declared that they intend to consummate
                        an utter defeat of Japan.</p>
                    <p>Under these circumstances, it is by no means certain that at a time when,
                        say, nine months or twelve months or eighteen months from now, we might wish
                        to use Chinese air fields for direct offensives against Japan we will find
                        those air fields available.</p>
                    <p>There is only one way in which we can effectively oppose, offset and counter
                        the policy which Japan is now following in China and the present trend of
                        Chinese thought with regard to the war: the one and only potentially
                        effective measure that we (and the British) have available to us for that
                        purpose lies in the realm of increasing the delivery of materials of
                        war—specifically, planes, guns, trucks, miscellaneous munitions,
                        medicines—and, along with these, personnel, for current and future
                        reinforcing of the Chinese military machine and our own military forces in
                        China. The Chinese are thinking with their eyes, their hands, their feet,
                        their tired bodies and their empty pocket books, rather than with their
                        ears. What is needed in China for the purposes of the United Nations today
                        is visible and tangible evidence of intention and capacity on the part of
                        the United States and Great Britain to make use of China’s potentialities in
                        and as a part of the United Nations war effort. It could be done. C. N. A.

                            March 31, <ref target="#pg_41">p. 41</ref>, and a memorandum dated April
                            2, not printed.</note> which are self-explanatory. In the course of
                        brief conversations which I had with Ambassador Gauss during his recent
                        brief visit here, Mr. Gauss indicated that the subject of the Chinese Air
                        Corps pilots was very much in his thought. He said that he had had
                        opportunity to talk with you only very briefly in Chungking and would not be
                        able to talk with you during the short period of his visit here. He gave me,
                        however, a memorandum, as indicated, under date March 31. The best use which
                        I can make of that memorandum is, it seems to me, to send it on to you.

                        study the political angles of this and related questions, feel that the use
                        made or not made, in China, of Chinese personnel trained in the United
                        States—in no matter what field of training—has always been and will continue
                        to be a matter of importance in connection with the general problem of
                        relations between the United States and China.</p>

                    <p>Recent reports from the Department’s officers in free China indicate that
                        trade between free China and Japanese-occupied China has reached sizable
                        proportions and is on the increase. For example, one transaction across the
                        Sino-Japanese front lines in southwest China involved 1,000 horse loads of
                        goods; in Central China some 1,200 tons of goods a month move each way along
                        the Yangtze River and across the lines; and in North China a large traffic
                        also moves across the opposing lines. It is reported that at Sian, in free
                        China, where the payments for this traffic in North China are largely
                        settled, the banks of that city now handle remittances to Shanghai and
                        Tientsin in occupied China. The goods passing from free into
                        Japanese-occupied China consist chiefly of raw materials, including such
                        essential war materials as tungsten, and the goods proceeding in the
                        opposite direction chiefly of finished consumer goods. The Chinese
                        authorities are encouraging the importation from occupied areas of the
                        latter type of goods by waiving import duty in the case of certain
                        categories of such goods and by facilitating payment of excise taxes in the
                        case of other categories. The Japanese are reportedly interested, not in
                        stopping this traffic, but in controlling it so that the goods passing into
                        free China may be restricted to luxuries and daily necessities and that the
                        goods coming from free China may be confined to materials needed for Japan’s
                        wartime economy.</p>
                    <p>Continuation and growth of this traffic constitute a serious danger to the
                        war effort of the United Nations. Chinese commanders in the field are
                        constantly exposed to the temptation of utilizing their controlling position
                        to profit personally by the traffic, thus developing a vested interest in an
                        undisturbed front which cannot but harmfully <pb n="46" xml:id="pg_46" facs="0056"/>affect their offensive spirit. According to a reliable
                        report, for example, one Chinese commander interfered with a sabotage
                        project of a British unit because it would have interfered with the peaceful
                        commercial intercourse which had been established between his area and the
                        area beyond the Japanese line facing him.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Foreign Minister<note n="53" xml:id="d34fn53">T. V. Soong.</note>
                        on March 31 after attending the Pacific War Council in Washington told
                        reporters that the Japanese were using “softer” tactics with the Chinese.
                        The “softer” tactics mentioned by Dr. Soong referred primarily to Japanese
                        measures intended to persuade Chinese puppets to collaborate with the
                        Japanese in fact as well as in name. We feel that Japanese encouragement of
                        trade across the lines represents “softer” tactics of a much more
                        significant and sinister nature from our point of view, as it suggests the
                        adoption by the Japanese of a policy calculated to promote peaceful
                        intercourse between occupied and unoccupied areas and to lull the Chinese
                        forces into military inactivity. In view of the war-weariness of the Chinese
                        forces, their appallingly poor physical condition in many instances, their
                        inadequate equipment, and their ebbing morale—ebbing from a variety of
                        causes, economic, financial, political, administrative and
                        psychological—this policy may well be reciprocated and may lead to at least
                        a tacit or <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> truce between the Chinese and
                        Japanese armies.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing developments emphasize, in our opinion, the urgent need of
                        consideration by our military as well as other concerned authorities of
                        immediate concrete measures looking to a rectification of the situation. The
                        famine in essential consumer goods in free China can be relieved only by
                        delivery into China of such goods—and this can be accomplished only by a
                        comparatively large increase in the number of transport planes flying
                        between India and China and the allocation of the additional planes for this
                        particular purpose. Practical measures to activate the moribund front in
                        China would include, as Mr. Hornbeck pointed out in his memorandum of April
                            3,<note n="*" xml:id="d34fn54">Copy attached. [Footnote in the original;

                        visible and tangible evidences in China, in planes, guns, trucks,
                        miscellaneous munitions, medicines, and military personnel, of our intention
                        to attack the Japanese in and from China, and to help the Chinese fight the
                        Japanese. Those measures would also include some concrete cooperative
                        tactical plan between the American and Chinese military authorities whereby
                        the Chinese forces, which are deteriorating in part because of their
                        comparative inactivity, would undertake offensive actions against
                        Japanese-held positions with the support of our air force.</p>

                            Toronto, Melbourne and Sydney, 1944), p. 33.</note> and to enclose for
                        the Department’s information a copy of a despatch<note n="56" xml:id="d35fn56">Not printed.</note> concerning the reaction at Chengtu
                        to that speech submitted by Mr. Drumright, Secretary of Embassy on detail at
                        Chengtu.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drumright reports that he has detected among Chinese officials, educators
                        and others with whom he has discussed Mr. Churchill’s speech an
                        ill-concealed feeling of disappointment, frustration and even anger. The
                        Chinese people appear to have been led to think in recent months that
                        Germany’s collapse would be a matter of a short time and that pressure
                        against Japan would not be relaxed. They are consequently dismayed at the
                        prospect of a further delay in the attempts of their allies to turn their
                        strength against Japan. Mr. Drumright states that the Chinese people appear
                        to be becoming tired of a seemingly endless conflict and that they feel that
                        China is being ignored with respect to assistance which is her due. Mr.
                        Churchill’s speech increased that feeling of discontent and disillusionment.
                        The omission of China in the portions of the speech having to do with
                        post-war conferences was also a cause of deep resentment, for the Chinese
                        regard themselves as one of the four major powers and thus entitled to a
                        suitable place in the discussion of world problems. Mr. Drumright concludes
                        that this speech may have destroyed whatever goodwill that may have been
                        built up in China by British propaganda efforts during the past year.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Embassy has noted that the Chinese seem to have been
                        mollified somewhat by the speech given by Mr. Anthony Eden at Annapolis on
                        March 26.<note n="57" xml:id="d35fn57">Before the Maryland General Assembly;
                            see <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>, vol. 89, pt. 2, p.
                            2737.</note> The <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> welcomes his speech,
                        terming it “to the point, clear and satisfactory”. Mr. Eden’s proposals for
                        a new and more efficient international organization to be supported with
                        force and to be an organ for the enforcement of the Atlantic Charter
                        received the warm approval of the Chinese press, which generally was
                        effusive in its praise of Mr. Eden with references <pb n="48" xml:id="pg_48" facs="0058"/>to his advocacy of economic sanctions against Italy and his
                        well-known support of the League of Nations.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese people tend to associate Mr. Churchill with British imperialism,
                        suspicion of which no amount of British propaganda effort is likely to erase
                        from their minds and distrust of which has been increased by the British
                        handling of the Indian problem. The Chinese press is held in strict control
                        in its comment on the Indian situation, but even in the absence of any
                        editorial comment critical of the British it conveys a veiled hostility in
                        its treatment of news despatches. A British Secretary to the Indian-General
                        Agent to China has commented to the Embassy on the tone of the Chinese press
                        in dealing with news from India and has said that at the time of Gandhi’s
                        fast he pointed out to the Chinese Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs the
                        attitude of the Government of India toward Chinese press comment on Indian
                        questions simply in order to forestall Chinese press criticism on the
                        subject.</p>

                    <p>515. I have had a discussion with Acting Foreign Minister<note n="58" xml:id="d36fn58">K. C. Wu, Chinese Political Vice Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> in regard to the subject of Department’s 428, April 1, 6
                        p.m. He states that Chinese Government is not now concerned regarding
                        Japan’s “new China policy” in occupied China and I find other Chinese
                        officials of like mind. He described Japan’s “new China policy” as one of
                        appeasement. He cites as significant Tojo’s recent address [to] Jap
                        residents in Shanghai, when he instructed them to treat Chinese as equals
                        and as brothers other than as conquered people, and the action, presumably
                        taken on Tojo’s instructions, in changing Jap special service officers in
                        China into liaison officers for maintenance of relations with Chinese
                        officials. The appeasement policy, he states, is not now a matter for
                        concern but if the war in the Far East is prolonged and if as a result
                        Chinese in occupied areas become disheartened this policy might prove
                        effective. He states that Japan, with the large resources now at its
                        command, is growing stronger and that there is a very real danger that
                        Chinese in occupied China may become impressed with this fact and be
                        influenced by the appeasement policy to the point that they may cooperate
                        with the Japs. With regard to increased use of puppet troops by Japan, he
                        states that situation is not perturbing, <pb n="49" xml:id="pg_49" facs="0059"/>that Japs must still maintain close surveillance of puppet
                        troops but that those troops may be influenced in their attitude by the
                        circumstances outlined above.</p>
                    <p>I incline to the belief that Dr. Wu’s views are a reflection in some measure
                        of recent discussions in Executive Yuan Cabinet meetings and possibly in the
                        Supreme National Defense Council. The connection made between possible
                        effectiveness of Jap appeasement in occupied China and the feeling that the
                        war is being unnecessarily prolonged because of Allied concentration on the
                        European rather than the Pacific theatre of the war is obviously another
                        attempt to put forward Chinese claim for active operations in the Pacific
                        theatre. However, I feel that, rightly or wrongly, there is a degree of
                        sincerity behind the views expressed.</p>
                    <p>The Chief of military intelligence, expressing his views without knowledge of
                        the views outlined above by Acting Foreign Minister told me that the Jap
                        appeasement policy had come too late to be effective among the civilian
                        population in occupied China and that there was little to be feared from
                        increase in puppet troops. He said that there had been no defections of
                        military or such officials from here to the Nanking régime but admitted that
                        some Chinese officials in minor positions and businessmen had, for family
                        reasons, recently found their way back to Shanghai and that some Chinese of
                        prominence in occupied areas had been forced to appear to join the Nanking
                        régime. He said that Chinese here were not impressed with Tojo’s recent
                        attempts to give face to Wang Ching-wei.</p>
                    <p>While recognizing that the development of Jap policy in occupied China cannot
                        be lightly dismissed as insignificant, I do not feel that it is cause for
                        serious concern.</p>

                    <p>596. Following paragraph is summary of Military Attaché’s weekly review of
                        military situation: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Chinese communiqués have carried numerous accounts of renewed
                                fighting but it is believed that successes claimed represent simply
                                reoccupation of area vacated by Japanese. There was no evidence of
                                coordinated Jap offensive in this theatre. Isolated and small scale
                                engagements took place in Shantung, Honan, Kiangsi, Hupeh, Hunan,
                                and Kwangtung provinces. In western Yunnan drive undertaken by
                                several thousand Jap soldiers moving from Mangshih, southwest of
                                Lungling, was reported checked by Chinese. General Hata, commander
                                of Jap forces in China, returned to Nanking from inspection trip in
                                North China.</p>
                        </quote>
               </p>
                    <p>My interpretation of recent military encounters in China which Chinese report
                        in large number is that they are continuation of type of warfare that has
                        prevailed in China for past several years. The Chinese giving away before
                        superior force are always ready to reoccupy points evacuated by Japs or to
                        drive Japs from places when garrisons are weakened by withdrawals and to
                        engage Jap foraging units. These harassing tactics have no major importance
                        but they do in a measure prevent Japs from complacent consolidation of
                        positions and from making much profit from various minor positions.</p>
                    <p>There are widely divergent interpretations of Jap Cabinet changes. Wang
                        Peng-sheng, advisor to Generalissimo on Jap affairs, interprets them as
                        final move prior to war against Russia and is of opinion that Japan will
                        attack Russia before June with initial seizure of North of Sakhalin Island.
                        Chief of Military Intelligence does not accept this prediction. He suspects
                        an offer of peace negotiations presumably to China by Shigemitsu<note n="59" xml:id="d38fn59">Mamoru Shigemitsu, Japanese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> and the appointment of Ando<note n="60" xml:id="d38fn60">Lt. Gen. Kisaburo Ando.</note> to Home Affairs and Tojo’s taking over
                        Education Ministry as precaution against <pb n="51" xml:id="pg_51" facs="0061"/>unrest in Japan. Others anticipate renewed efforts to reach
                        amicable understanding with Russia and to persuade Russia to make peace with
                        Germany. For further views see Embassy’s 585, April 23, and 587, April 24,
                        11 a.m.<note n="61" xml:id="d38fn61">Neither printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Japanese radio broadcasts have reported that on April 20 Wang Ching-wei
                        addressed an appeal to Chiang Kai-shek to abandon resistance and join with
                        Nanking régime in a “peace move to save the country.” It is probable that
                        recent Japanese moves to gain confidence of Chinese in occupied areas may
                        also be utilized in an attempt to weaken Chinese will to resistance through
                        an appeal to Chinese unity and a show of friendship and non-aggressive
                        intention toward China. A Catholic priest recently arrived from Peiping
                        brings report that Japanese plan greatly to reduce their troops in North
                        China, substituting therefor Chinese puppet troops and to have Wang Chingwei
                        remove his seat of Government to Peiping. Fact that North China has been
                        returned to Chinese will then be widely advertised. I do not believe this
                        campaign will have any appreciable effect on Chinese in control of
                        Government here and little upon Chinese in general. I do not believe however
                        that primary significance Shigemitsu’s appointment as Foreign Minister is to
                        be found in Japan’s plans for carrying out its “new China policy”—its “China
                        appeasement policy” as the Chinese Foreign Office describes it.</p>
                    <p>Japan may have decided to attack Russia but it is not believed that Cabinet
                        changes can be interpreted as evidence of such decisions and positive
                        indications of an intended attack are lacking here. The Chinese fluctuate
                        between prediction of an imminent Russo-Japanese war and a Russo-Japanese
                        entente. They seem intent on having one or the other. It will be recalled
                        that at regular intervals since June 1941, there have been predictions of
                        war, including that of the Generalissimo who told Ambassador on July 4, 1941
                        that Japan would attack Russia in 2 weeks. Recently Chinese have strongly
                        suspected that Japan and Russia were about to make a deal. There has been no
                        apparent factual basis for any of these predictions.</p>

                        close adviser to the Generalissimo on Japanese affairs, <pb n="52" xml:id="pg_52" facs="0062"/>in recent conversation with a member of my

                        British Government takes a firm attitude toward the Sikorski<note n="63" xml:id="d39fn63">Gen. Wladyslaw Sikorski, Polish Premier and Commander
                            in Chief with headquarters in London.</note> Government forcing it to
                        forego further disruptive action and to placate the Russians as far as
                        possible. He argued that unless the Soviet Union was supported in this
                        matter it would slacken the fight and turn its thoughts toward a separate
                        peace. He maintained that the matter of which Polish Government rules Poland
                        is one for decision after the war and that dissatisfaction and defection on
                        the part of the Sikorski Government is unimportant compared to even a slight
                        slackening of Russian participation in the United Nations effort.</p>
                    <p>Wang’s emphasis upon the importance of placating Russia was somewhat
                        explained when he went on to urge that Russia should be persuaded to open up
                        a second front against Japan with full American and Chinese cooperation. He
                        argued that Japan could now be crushed much more quickly than Germany but if
                        it were allowed sufficient time to consolidate gains and coordinate its
                        economic and political framework more completely it would before long become
                        even harder to crush than Germany.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>Following is submitted by Colonel DePass: A report from a questionable source
                        indicates that at recent conferences in Nanking between Japanese, Puppets
                        and Chinese communists the Japanese promised the conquest of China during
                        1943; to permit the incorporation of Sinkiang, Shensi and Kansu communist
                        area in to the U. S. S. R.; to support puppet control; and to begin in June
                        all-out China operations with attacks on Kunming and Sian and thereafter to
                        converge on Chungking (Note: The above report was rated by Colonel DePass as
                        C–4 meaning a fairly reliable source and a doubtfully true report).</p>
                    <p>His comment is that certain conditions render credence to the report such as
                        the Chinese admission of concern toward the attitude of the 8th Route Army,
                        a report from an observer in the northwest, Tokyo’s promise of an important
                        victory, gradual reinforcements in Burma and the present fighting in
                        Taihengshan. He believes that Japan has sufficient forces in China to
                        complete her conquest, if undertaken, <pb n="53" xml:id="pg_53" facs="0063"/>in less than seven months but he interprets present indications as meaning
                        that Japan will continue her strategic defense in the China Theater,
                        increase her war production, consolidate present holdings, improve her
                        economic conditions and develop all available resources.<note n="64" xml:id="d40fn64">In his telegram No. 646, May 4, noon, the Chargé in

                    <p>717. During a call on the Generalissimo this afternoon, General Chiang stated
                        to Vincent and me, with the Acting Foreign Minister interpreting, that if
                        during the discussions in Washington between the President and Mr. Churchill
                        there should arise any question in regard to China or to the Pacific area
                        necessitating consultation with Chinese representatives, it was his desire
                        that both Madame Chiang and Dr. T. V. Soong act as such representatives.
                        General Chiang asked that this be considered an official request by the
                        Chinese Government.</p>

                                Advantages of a Chiang–Roosevelt Meeting</hi>
               </p>
                        <p>In conversation with one of the officials who is very close to
                            Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, he said he failed to understand the
                            reason why no effort had been made to arrange a meeting between
                            Generalissimo Chiang and President Roosevelt. Much publicity and
                            importance had been given to the Churchill–Roosevelt parley. He frankly
                            expressed his belief that it was the intention of the United Nations to
                            crush Hitler in Europe before they come to China’s assistance and that
                            it might be that the leaders of the United Nations regard the China
                            front as unimportant and that the Chinese are capable of carrying on the
                            war against the Japanese invaders indefinitely and that a little delay
                            would not seriously jeopardize her position. He, in a way, admitted that
                            this is probably the best plan and that the leaders of the United
                            Nations are doing everything possible to help win the war. He even went
                            so far as to express his opinion that failure of President Roosevelt to
                            invite Chiang Kai-shek to a conference might be attributed to the fact
                            that the Allied Leaders regard China as an inferior power and that no
                            possible advantage could be gained by such a meeting.</p>
                        <p>When assured that that was not the case and that everything is being
                            worked out and will be carried out when the time is ripe and that all
                            military strategy must be kept secret until the time [is] ripe to
                            execute them, he acknowledged the soundness of the plan and he hinted
                            that a Chiang–Roosevelt meeting would serve to bolster up the ebbing
                            morale of the Chinese people. He stated that before the attack on Pearl
                            Harbor, Chinese morale was at its lowest and on the outbreak of the
                            Pacific War, the Chinese people looked forward to better days and that
                            more help would be given China by the United States and other Allies.
                            The loss of Burma and the closing of the Burma Road was a serious blow
                            to Chinese morale and with the lapse of almost one and one half years,
                            during which time only a fraction of Lease Lend materials trickled into
                            China by air transport, Chinese morale took <pb n="55" xml:id="pg_55" facs="0065"/>another downward dive. He pointed out that a
                            Chiang–Roosevelt meeting, even if nothing important is discussed other
                            than a friendly exchange of greetings, would enhance Chinese morale to
                            such an extent that it would be even better than all the Lease-Lend
                            materials the United States could get into China. If such a meeting
                            could be brought about at the invitation of President Roosevelt, Chinese
                            officials and the Chinese populace would be made to realize that at
                            least such powerful nations as the United States recognize that China
                            still has a place, if not an equal place, in the ranks of the Allied
                            Council, and on the strength of this, China would gain politically and
                            financially. Restoration of confidence that help is within the horizon
                            would tend to cause merchants and traders to reflect that with Allied
                            financial and material backings the day would not be far off when goods
                            would be flowing freely and in abundance into blockaded China. If the
                            people can be brought into this frame of mind, confidence in the
                            strength of Chinese currency would prevail and prices of various
                            commodities would automatically be lowered.</p>
                        <p>He admitted that Chiang could have asked for such a conference but that
                            he refrained from doing so on account of “face”, which is still the
                            predominating force in the Chinese political and social world.</p>

                    <p>760. Churchill’s address on May 19, before the Congress<note n="68" xml:id="d44fn68">
                     <hi rend="italic">Congressional Record</hi>, vol. 89,
                            pt. 4, p. 4619.</note> is characterized as “encouraging” by the Chinese
                        press which has, of course, given it considerable prominence and comment.
                        However, from remarks volunteered by Chinese officials in private
                        conversation, it is apparent that the speech has failed to dissipate the
                        cynicism with which British intentions and promises in regard to the
                        question of the defeat of Japan seems generally to be viewed in official
                        Chinese circles here. Unfortunately it does not appear likely that this
                        attitude will alter materially until some concrete British military success
                        against the Japanese demonstrates that the defeat of Japan at the earliest
                        possible moment is a British objective for which, in due course, they will
                        strive whole-heartedly and with every possible resource.</p>

                            printed.</note> Acording to an authoritative source, a very highly
                        placed Chinese official in Washington has telegraphed a very high military
                        and political leader here that the American Naval and Military Attachés and
                        the British Military Attaché are reporting to Washington that the situation
                        created by the Jap military operations in western Hupeh is not serious and
                        requesting that pressure be brought upon the Attachés to report
                        affirmatively in regard to the seriousness of the situation. It is
                        disturbing to all of us here that confidential reports should find their way
                        so far afield and with such a result, the implications of which are
                        obvious.</p>
                    <p>As regards the situation in western Hupeh, it is my understanding that the
                        point of view of our Naval and Military Attachés is in general, that a Jap
                        military operation involving from 50 to 70,000 men has, of course, serious
                        implications especially as Chinese resistance appears to be weak, the Japs
                        are progressing some 18 miles a day and one Jap thrust appears to be
                        directed along the south bank of the Yangtze towards Santowping, sometimes
                        called “the gateway to Chungking” because of the situation there of the
                        principal Chinese fortifications guarding the approach to the Gorges. The
                        Attachés and other observers, however, believe that if the Japs were
                        actually undertaking a drive on Chungking they would necessarily employ a
                        much larger force and would choose a route presenting less obstacles in the
                        way of difficult terrain. The Attachés are inclined to the opinion that the
                        prime [motive?] of the drive in Hupeh (as well as in Hunan) is economic;
                        that is, the clearing of the river to some point west of Ichang and the
                        denial of its use by the Chinese for transportation of produce, the
                        operations in Hunan being designed to encircle and cut off from Free China
                        the great Hunan “rice bowl”. Of course if the fortifications at Santowping
                        are reduced by the Japs they will have made much more open the Yangtze route
                        to Chungking and the Chinese will have suffered an important reverse which
                        may have serious implications for the future.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that detailed reports on the situation are being despatched
                        daily to their respective departments by the Naval and Military
                        Attachés.</p>

                    <p>803. It may be of interest to the Department for me to set forth my
                        impressions, after 3 weeks in Chungking, of the situation in China, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>While the determination of General Chiang Kai-shek, and his supporters in the
                        policy of resistance to continue to hold out does not seem to be lessening,
                        they feel a situation which in many aspects is out of control and which in
                        practically all aspects is seriously deteriorating. Economically the
                        deterioration is rapid and is leading toward something that may eventually
                        spell disaster. The military situation is slower than the economic, but
                        there is a vicious circle in the relationship between the two by which each
                        is worsened. Thus lack of food is affecting the troops more adversely than
                        the lack of ammunition has affected them in the past 5½ years (the price of
                        rice in Kweilin and Chungking has doubled since the beginning of the year)
                        and as current Japanese military operations in Hunan and Hupeh Provinces,
                        one of China’s important “rice bowls”, is being circled and lost to Free
                        China. If the Japanese success continues, if the Chinese suffer further
                        serious reverses on other fronts, or if the new crops are not good it is not
                        unlikely that there may be precipitated a crisis which will further greatly
                        lessen Free China’s power of endurance and resistance.</p>
                    <p>As a result of these circumstances and combination of circumstances Chinese
                        morale in general is progressively being lowered. In the past it has seemed
                        that if the morale of China’s leaders were sustained the morale of the
                        soldiers and of the people would remain at a fair level. At present one of
                        the greatest dangers is that the already low morale of the troops and of the
                        people may break, irrespective of the determination of some of the leaders
                        to hold together the shaky economic and military structure. The common
                        people and the common soldiers, never safely distant from the margin of
                        subsistence, cannot live on the belief in an eventual Allied victory or on
                        the wishful thinking in regard to the post-war world which helps sustain
                        some high officials, and the people must have food and clothing and the
                        soldiers must have in addition to these things guns, ammunition, artillery
                        and adequate air support. There is a limit to their extraordinary endurance
                        and resistance; and even greater than Chinese capacity in those respects is
                            <pb n="58" xml:id="pg_58" facs="0068"/>their capacity, when faced with
                        the inevitable, for accepting things as they are.</p>
                    <p>A tendency on the part of the military as well as other Chinese to make the
                        best of the realities is apparent in the growing trade and smuggling between
                        unoccupied and occupied China. With this tendency unchecked—and if the
                        Japanese should refrain from further advances—there is a strong probability
                        of a further extension between Free and occupied China of the armed truce
                        which already exists in many places, with trade across the static lines
                        expanding, with the Japanese and the puppets peacefully consolidating their
                        position as they have in Manchuria, and with Free China becoming
                        economically dependent upon the other area.</p>
                    <p>In any case the existing situation cannot endure very much longer. A number
                        of intelligent Chinese of affairs with sober, conservative and balanced
                        minds have variously estimated to me that under present conditions China
                        “can last” only from 6 months to a year. If they were speaking only in terms
                        of inflation and currency depreciation their estimates might be considered
                        by the optimistic as exaggerated, although it is difficult to conceive that
                        population can or will continue indefinitely to bear up under an
                        inflationary process whereby the cost of living has become eighty times what
                        it was in 1937 and continues to rise some 10% a month. Already there is
                        agrarian unrest in a number of widely scattered places. In Provinces of
                        Hupeh, Hunan, Kweichow, Kwangtung, Fukien, Kansu and Ningsia (due to
                        conscription, requisitioning of grain for troops, taxes in kind and
                        corruption on part of local tax and other officials) except that in
                        Kwangtung famine is chiefly responsible and in Fukien bad crops (and there
                        is increasing desertion of soldiers and petty officials to puppets. In
                        Shansi Province General Sun Tien-ying with 30,000 troops not long ago
                        reported[ly] went over to puppet [régime?]).</p>
                    <p>The magnitude of the problem should not be underestimated if it is to be met.
                        It is a part of their deterioration in morale and their appreciation and
                        acceptance of realities that they have come to adopt an attitude of sitting
                        back and waiting for the United States and Great Britain to resolve their
                        grievous and increasing difficulties by crushing Japan. Chinese
                        officialdom’s highly developed interest in postwar problems is an example of
                        this psychological process; they seem to seek, any of them, escape from
                        these realities, which they cannot cope with, into a vague but roseate
                        future which unfortunately can never materialize unless something drastic is
                        done successfully about the present.</p>
                    <p>Foreign loans will no longer help. Political gestures are limited in
                        usefulness to their effect upon leaders, who for most part actually <pb n="59" xml:id="pg_59" facs="0069"/>lead only in a negative way;
                        political gestures do not help the troops or the people.</p>
                    <p>The inviting of General Chiang Kai-shek to a conference with the President
                        and Mr. Churchill recently suggested by Mr. Churchill as a possibility would
                        undoubtedly give much encouragement to Chiang himself as he feels that he
                        has lost face with his officials and peoples because he has not received
                        such invitation in the past. The recapture of Burma would give great
                        encouragement to the soldiers and the people, but any concrete effect on the
                        economic situation, after the first upswing towards new confidence, would be
                        long delayed during the process of restoring the Burma Road and placing it
                        in effective operation. Even then its actual economic benefits to the people
                        as a whole would be meager because of the minor role foreign consumer goods
                        play in the lives of agrarian peasants.</p>
                    <p>Wong Wen-hao, Minister of Economic Affairs, and some other economically
                        minded Chinese have advanced the theory that if the Chinese could recapture
                        and hold Ichang and the hinterland leading into southern Hupeh and Hunan,
                        and if they could also hold the Hunan area, the flow of produce and cotton
                        into Free China would soon reduce the cost of food and clothing by 50%. The
                        current Jap military successes on the Hupeh–Hunan front (Embassy’s 800, May
                        28, 9 a.m.) are daily rendering any such possibility all the more remote as
                        a result of Chinese efforts alone. The question arises whether there is any
                        action which China’s allies might take in their own interest toward
                        rehabilitating the morale of the China’s allies might take in their own
                        interest toward rehabilitating the morale of the Chinese troops and toward
                        improving situation as a whole. Would it for example be practicable for
                        American and British military authorities to work out some tactical
                        arrangement with the Chinese military whereby the latter, with adequate
                        British and American air support, would undertake determined offensive
                        action to attack and recapture at least one or two economically and
                        militarily important points such as Ichang, Hankow, etc.? As regards
                        military matters one can of course do no more than offer for possible
                        consideration by those competent to judge and decide, such suggestions as
                        occur to an observer who perceives the necessity that something be done.
                        There would seem to be little doubt that forthright and significant military
                        action having direct bearing upon the situation within China must be taken
                        in the near future if China’s most valuable potentialities for the common
                        war effort are not to be lost to us.</p>

                    <p>General Stilwell has discussed with me the request which he is now making for
                        the detail of four Foreign Service officers to him.</p>
                    <p>The request arises from the General’s realization that he is confronted
                        constantly with complicated political, economic and psychological problems
                        in the prosecution of the war against the enemy, and in his relations and in
                        his commanders’ relations with Chinese officials from General on down,
                        British civil officials in India, British administrators in Burma, the
                        various Burmese factions, the free Thais, the Vichy French, the free French,
                        and the Indochinese; that his staff officers—professional military men—are
                        for the most part not equipped to collect and evaluate information nor
                        advise in these matters; and that he must perforce turn elsewhere for this
                        vital intelligence and advice.</p>
                    <p>OSS, BEW and OWI are placing at his disposal experts in economic and
                        psychological warfare. Some of this personnel has had political reporting
                        experience in the Far East. These experts will collect information by
                        various means and two small groups of them will constitute Boards of
                        Research and Analysis in American Army Headquarters at Chungking and New
                        Delhi. All incoming information will be funneled into the Boards of Research
                        and Analysis which will cross-check and evaluate material and will prepare
                        basic studies for the General.</p>
                    <p>The two Boards will be headed by OSS representatives who will operate under
                        orders issued by General Stilwell or his deputy in this undertaking. The
                        Boards will technically be OSS organizations and so will report back to
                        General Donovan. I anticipate, however, that BEW and OWI representatives
                        will also sit in on the Boards. If they do, they will probably keep their
                        Washington offices informed of such findings of the Boards as may be of
                        appropriate interest.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell has orally charged me with supervising this political,
                        economic and psychological intelligence and warfare program. As a Foreign
                        Service officer somewhat anxious over the encroachment of new Government
                        agencies in the field of foreign affairs, I feel not only as the General
                        does—that the detail of the four officers requested will be of very real
                        assistance to him in his tremendously difficult and delicate task—but also
                        that the five of us working in close <pb n="61" xml:id="pg_61" facs="0071"/>coordination under the guidance of the Ambassador at Chungking and Chief
                        of Mission at New Delhi can give some political direction to this program
                        and forestall errors which representatives of the new agencies might
                        otherwise commit. The five of us would of course keep the Embassy or Mission
                        informed regarding the progress of the program and report intelligence of
                        interest.</p>
                    <p>The request for the detail of Mr. Emmerson<note n="72" xml:id="d47fn72">John
                            K. Emmerson, Third Secretary of Embassy in Peru since returning from
                            Japan.</note> is based on the General’s urgent need for a Japan expert
                        at his Chungking headquarters. He is at present without one. If the
                        General’s request for Mr. Emmerson is complied with, Mr. Emmerson will
                        probably be designated as a member of the Board of Research and Analysis and
                        will probably be called upon to give advice in Japanese political, economic
                        and psychological matters.</p>
                    <p>The request for Mr. Service<note n="73" xml:id="d47fn73">John S. Service,
                            Third Secretary of Embassy in China.</note> is based upon a pressing
                        need for an officer with an excellent command of the Chinese language and
                        one possessing wide contact with and knowledge of Chinese officials. General
                        Stilwell knows Mr. Service and is particularly anxious to have him on his
                        staff. While Mr. Service would probably spend most of his time in Chungking
                        on the Board of Research and Analysis and provide information and advice to
                        General Stilwell in his highly delicate relations with the Generalissimo and
                        other Chinese officials, Mr. Service would probably also be used for
                        occasional special investigation trips into the interior.</p>

                        along the Burmese, Thai and Indochina borders, facilitating the relations
                        between American units in these areas and the local Chinese officials. He
                        will also be most valuable in advising OSS and Army units in their contacts
                        with free Thais, British administrators in Burma, Burmese, the French
                        factions and Indochinese. Finally, he will have first-hand contact with
                        intelligence sources channeling in from Burma, Thailand and Indochina.</p>

                    <p>This noon I had luncheon with Mr. David Lu, Central News representative in
                        Washington, and Major General Whang Ping-hung, Chinese Air Attaché.</p>
                    <p>During the course of the conversation Mr. Lu mentioned a rumor which had come
                        to his attention to the effect that the Generalissimo had opposed General
                        Stilwell’s proposal for the training and equipping of 600,000 Chinese troops
                        because General Chiang realized that the general who commanded these troops
                        would be strong enough to challenge his position. Mr. Lu stated that such a
                        rumor was false and vicious.</p>
                    <p>General Whang, to my surprise, smiled tolerantly and said something to the
                        effect that Mr. Lu did not realize the complexity of Chinese politics.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Lu then asked why the Generalissimo did not appoint one of his own
                        trusted lieutenants, such as General Ho Ying-chin or General Chen Cheng.
                        Thereupon Genaral Whang said that while high officials of the Government
                        talked in public about there being only one leader—Chiang Kai-shek—in
                        private they were interested only in furthering their own power. He stated
                        that Chen Cheng, who is in command of the divisions now being trained and
                        equipped in Yunnan, would, when the training program was completed, be the
                        strongest figure in China and that he would probably then bring T. V. Soong
                        back to be the political head of the Government.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a memorandum of
                        conversation of May 18 between Mr. Vincent and General Hsiung Shih-hui,
                        recently head of the Chinese Military Mission to the United States and
                        probable new head of the National Planning Board. Mr. Vincent suggested that
                        this memorandum might be held until General Hsiung’s appointment should be
                        gazetted, but it is believed that it is of sufficient <pb n="63" xml:id="pg_63" facs="0073"/>interest to send it forward without further
                        delay, whether or not General Hsiung actually receives the appointment in
                        question.</p>
                    <p>As pointed out in the memorandum, the reported decision of the Generalissimo
                        to appoint General Hsiung as head of the National Planning Board is another
                        indication of General Chiang’s determination to make China militarily strong
                        and self-sufficient and of the Kuomintang’s cynical attitude toward the
                        possibility of a real “new order” after the present war.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, General Hsiung is reported to be, following his return from the
                        United States, strongly anti-American and to have developed an inclination
                        to align himself with members of the so-called “Peace Party” who favor
                        making an endeavor at some appropriate time to come to terms with the
                        Japanese.</p>

                        <p>General Hsiung Shih-hui was at last evening’s Foreign Office dinner and
                            having learned confidentially that he is to replace Dr. Wang Shih-chieh
                            as head of the National Planning Board, I took the occasion privately to
                            congratulate him and to comment on the importance of the post because of
                            the need for constructive post-war planning on a broad scale. During the
                            conversation I remarked that, in my opinion, the great problems of
                            China’s development, in the order of their importance, were: improvement
                            of agriculture, finance, communications and industry. General Hsiung
                            took immediate exception, saying that China’s first problem was military
                            security particularly in the north; and that that was the reason the
                            Generalissimo was putting him, a military man, at the head of the Board
                            in the place of the present civilian.</p>
                        <p>This decision is another indication of the Generalissimo’s determination,
                            shown in his recent book, <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>, to
                            make China militarily strong and self-sufficient, and of the
                            Kuomintang’s disillusioned attitude toward the possibility of a real
                            “new order” after the present war. There is a general distrust and
                            suspicion of Russia and an expectation that China and Russia will find
                            themselves in conflicting positions in the post-war period.</p>

                    <p>999. It may be of interest to Department in connection with problem of
                        evaluating news despatches from China for us to describe briefly and comment
                        upon certain aspects of the operation of the Chinese censorship and
                        publicity system.</p>
                    <p>While there appear to exist no formal or definitive rules governing
                        censorship, the general policy appears to be to prevent the sending out of
                        China of any material which conceivably might cause the government
                        political, diplomatic or economic embarrassment. Special attention seems to
                        be directed toward avoiding (1) embarrassment in internal political matters
                        through the republication in the local press of news despatches to foreign
                        countries on Chinese domestic affairs and (2) embarrassment in regard to
                        China’s international, political and economic position through publication
                        abroad of news which might tend to weaken the case for China’s stability and
                        strength which Chinese representatives have built up in Washington, London,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>As regards domestic policy, subjects, of which no mention is permitted in the
                        news despatches of the foreign correspondents, include Communist-Kuomintang
                        differences; the existence of cliques or quarrels within the Kuomintang; the
                        movements and personal life of the Generalissimo (except for occasional
                        carefully edited special articles in which reference to him may be only [in]
                        honorific terms); the circumstances surrounding the writing of the
                        Generalissimo’s book <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>, and direct
                        quotations therefrom; and subjects which might cast reflection upon China’s
                        Government and administrators such as corruption of public officials.</p>
                    <p>As regards economic matters the subject of inflation is a forbidden one
                        specifically and generally; price levels, the prices of food and other
                        ordinary consumer goods (unless reference can be made to something
                        officially published) and descriptions of the economic situation as being
                        “serious” or “critical”, etc., are forbidden. An example of the extent to
                        which restrictions are applied is that correspondents may not mention that
                        any Chungking street is dirty.</p>
                    <p>As regards foreign affairs, mention is prohibited of any subject which might
                        conceivably offend or cause offense to an ally (such as discussion of the
                        Indian situation and Chinese reaction thereto; mention of possible
                        divergence of views among China, Britain and Russia with regard to Tibet,
                        Mongolia and Turkestan and questions of the rendition of Hong Kong and
                        Kowloon). There is sporadic but not continuous prohibition of discussion of
                        Soviet-Jap relations.</p>
                    <pb n="65" xml:id="pg_65" facs="0075"/>
                    <p>Various devices some bordering on trickery are employed to impel
                        correspondents to write the kind of press despatches desired by Chinese
                        authorities. One such was the calling out of the correspondents at 1:30 a.m.
                        on May 24 (Embassy’s 782, May 25, 7 p.m.<note n="76" xml:id="d50fn76">Not
                            printed.</note>) to cause them to send home, without opportunity to
                        check accuracy or veracity of the material, urgent radiograms that the Japs
                        had begun large scale drive on Chungking. This device was repeated about
                        June 3 when Publicity Bureau of Foreign Office routed correspondents out of
                        bed at 2:30 a.m. and handed them a release describing China’s “great
                        victory” against the Japs (one request [<hi rend="italic">result?</hi>] of
                        the latter occasion it is understood was an editorial in the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi> describing the fighting along
                        south bank of the Yangtze as a second Stalingrad and a battle that might be
                        a turning point in the war).</p>
                    <p>Contentions by correspondents that this censorship policy may in the end do
                        this country untold injury when the truth in regard [to] unhappy conditions
                        here becomes generally known abroad have been ineffective assumably because
                        the policy is dictated from the highest places. The correspondents in
                        general are friendly to China and we believe their opinion this respect is
                        basically sound. We have not perceived on their part any desire to belittle
                        China, to disparage the [various?] aspects of China’s struggle for survival
                        or merely to carp at something they do not like. They realize that
                        censorship and publicity policies of the Chinese are important among the
                        [apparent omission] which have created in the United States and elsewhere or
                        which perhaps that is falsely colored and extravagantly distorted. And they
                        recognize the possibility that when true picture eventually emerges there
                        will result a disillusionment on the part of China’s friends at home or
                        abroad that in their chagrin over those deceptions that have been practiced
                        upon them these erstwhile supporters of China will lack the perspicuity to
                        retain their faith in the many worthwhile and admirable aspects of China’s
                        political, military and social structure.</p>

                        London and that he thought he would go over during the latter part of
                        July.</p>
                    <p>The Minister then proceeded to inquire of me what I thought about the
                        possible general attitude of the British toward China and the Far East. I
                        replied that at first blush it would seem to me that Great Britain would
                        have no other motive than one of friendship and friendly cooperation in all
                        mutually agreeable and desirable ways in the future. Dr. Soong stated that
                        he desired to speak in strict confidence to the effect that he and his
                        associates were afraid that Great Britain might undertake to play Japan and
                        China against each other during coming years. I said that, of course, he was
                        a better judge of these matters than I could be, but that really it was my
                        feeling that the Japanese should live on rice and mighty little of that
                        during the next twenty-five to fifty years until a complete reformation had
                        taken place with the ringleaders of militarism in that country promptly
                        executed at the end of the war. I added that in these circumstances there
                        would be very little of Japan left to set off against China in the sense of
                        playing one country against another. I reiterated that I was merely speaking
                        offhand with the knowledge that he knew far more about these matters than I
                        could profess to know.</p>
                    <p>I then took up the matter of the visit of his sister, Madame Chiang Kai-shek
                        to this country, emphasizing what a wonderful impression she had made and
                        the great good she has rendered to both our countries. I said that it was my
                        belief that she and the Generalissimo would live to see a great renaissance
                        take place in China in all important lines of human endeavor, such as swept
                        over Europe like a sunburst during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
                        Dr. Soong expressed his appreciation for these hopes and the interest in his
                        country which I and my associates in the State Department, he added, have
                        shown consistently during past years. I said further that the State
                        Department had recommended each of the loans to China during recent years.
                        Dr. Soong said he felt most appreciative, as did his Government.</p>
                    <p>I stated that we were keeping the attention of the Speaker and other leaders
                        in Congress focused on the desire of China for removal of the Exclusion Act
                        and the establishment of equality with other nations under immigration
                            laws;<note n="78" xml:id="d51fn78">See also <ref target="#pg_769">pp.
                                769</ref> ff.</note> that as a result of so many people everywhere
                        in this country as well as the rest of the world thinking abnormally at the
                        present time we may suffer delays in securing favorable action on the
                        legislative proposals in question but that in any event we shall keep these
                        proposals thoroughly alive among the leaders in Congress, in the hope that
                        at the earliest practicable date they may receive favorable consideration.
                        The Foreign Minister said that he <pb n="67" xml:id="pg_67" facs="0077"/>understood the situation perfectly and that he knew how earnestly we were
                        pressing these matters and how sincerely we were interested in them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong repeated a number of times his desire to call again before going to
                        Great Britain in the hope that I might offer some further suggestions to aid
                        him in his conversations with British officials. I referred to the principle
                        of self-preservation which brings together and holds together all the
                        peaceful nations in their common struggle to defeat and destroy the Axis
                        powers and added that this same principle will be of only secondary
                        importance to all countries after the war, and that if rational statesmen
                        cannot be convinced of this evident fact, the world will have a dark future
                        indeed. I concluded by saying that we must not become discouraged in our
                        efforts to persuade all statesmen of the truth of this obvious fact and to
                        induce them to act favorably upon it, et cetera.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>A number of foreign press correspondents have just returned from a two weeks
                        journey to the Yangtze front arranged at their request by the Chinese
                        authorities. They saw no fighting and at such late date were unable to
                        obtain comprehensive or important first hand information in regard to the
                        operations which took place during late May and earlier in June but a number
                        of interesting aspects of the general picture appear to have come to
                        light.</p>
                    <p>While they were told by the Chinese military that Chinese casualties were
                        10,000 in round numbers and Japanese casualties were 30,000, it is generally
                        understood (and the Military Attaché so believes) that on the Yangtze sector
                        there were never more than 24,000 Jap troops in action as against some
                        110,000 Chinese forces and that the number of Jap casualties was
                        approximately 7,000. The success of the Chinese troops and the American Air
                        Force which has resulted into a virtual return to the May <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> was due in part—and with much credit to the American
                        Air Force—to coordinate Sino-American action. It <pb n="68" xml:id="pg_68" facs="0078"/>was also due in part to the fact which now appears that the
                        Jap divisions included an appreciable admixture of puppet Chinese soldiers,
                        the Military Attaché’s estimate of the ratio in some of the units being one
                        Jap to two Koreans and six Manchurians. (Whether Wang Ching-wei troops
                        actually took part in combat seems to be unknown.) This appears to have been
                        the first Sino-Jap fighting outside of Manchuria on any scale in which
                        puppet troops participated to a considerable extent.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Political factors have proved
                        to be of major importance in the prosecution of the war in the
                        China–Burma–India Theater. Lieutenant General Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding
                        General of the U. S. Army Forces in that theater, is therefore urgently in
                        need of having trained political observers assigned to his command to
                        supplement the work done by his military intelligence.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell has indicated the names of certain Foreign Service Officers
                        who would be of assistance if sent to the theater for this purpose, as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>To be sent to the U. S. Embassy, Chungking, China for detail to the
                        Commanding General, U. S. Army Forces, China–Burma–India: <list>
                            <item>Raymond P. Ludden</item>
                            <item>John S. Service</item>
                            <item>John K. Emmerson</item>
                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>To be sent to the U. S. Mission at New Delhi for detail to the Commanding
                        General, U. S. Army Forces, China–Burma–India: <list>
                            <item>Kenneth C. Krentz</item>
                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>The duties of these officers would not only be to collect Chinese, Indian and
                        Japanese information of interest to General Stilwell, but also to be of
                        service to commanders in the field in matters affecting relations with the
                        various Burmese factions, British colonial administrators, the Free Thais,
                        the French in Indo-China and the Indo-Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Any assistance that you can give in connection with this matter will be
                        greatly appreciated.<note n="81" xml:id="d53fn81">In his letter of July 26,
                            the Secretary of State replied that the War Department’s request for

                    <p>859. Your no. 1052, June 29, 2 p.m. With reference to statement that the
                        Japanese divisions included an appreciable admixture of puppet Chinese
                        soldiers, estimated at the ratio in some units of 1 Japanese to 2 Koreans
                        and 6 Manchurians, it is assumed that what was referred to was
                        Japanese-commanded Manchukuo units rather than Japanese “divisions”. In view
                        of the political interest which attaches to this subject, the Department
                        would be interested in any further clarification you may be able to make,
                        also in an estimate of the proportion of Japanese Army, Manchukuo Army, and
                        intramural Chinese puppet (if any) units engaged in the operations in
                        question.</p>

                            <p>“Six years ago today, July 7, 1937, the Japanese launched at
                                Lukouchiao a new and brutal attack on China. Under your outstanding
                                leadership the Chinese armies and people immediately rose to the
                                defense of their country, and for 6 years they have used every

                                and justice are established throughout the world. Our people are
                                joined in a common cause. Our arms are mounting, our strength is

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
                        memorandum furnished the Embassy by the Foreign Office, giving a summary of
                        recent reports on the deterioration in the economic and political situation
                        in China which have been received from the British Embassy in Chungking in
                        answer to certain questions put by the Foreign Office.</p>
                    <p>In summary, it would appear that the British Embassy in Chungking believes
                        that if Japanese attacks in China are not substantially increased, the
                        maintenance of the present situation seems to depend more on the crop
                        prospects than on anything else. It is not believed that there will be a
                        Chinese attack on the Japanese, so that if it should suit the Japanese to
                        remain quiet, an easy state of undeclared peace might develop. However, it
                        is the opinion of the British Embassy in Chungking that as long as the
                        United States Air Force operates in China, the Japanese will presumably have
                        to react and complete quiet on the Chinese front would apparently be
                        impossible. It is felt that if a serious food shortage should occur, it
                        would probably lead to disturbances which might assume proportions leading
                        to loss of control over wide areas by the Central Government.</p>
                    <p>It was stated by a high official of the Foreign Office to a member of my
                        staff that the somewhat more optimistic view outlined in the present
                        memorandum is apparently an effort on the part of the British Embassy in
                        Chungking to present, in response to the Foreign Office’s request, all
                        aspects of the situation rather than the purely negative one reported
                        previously in this Embassy’s Cable No. 3791 of June 4, 1943, 11 a.m.<note n="85" xml:id="d57fn85">Not printed.</note>

                            in China, a number of questions were recently put to His <pb n="71" xml:id="pg_71" facs="0081"/>Majesty’s Ambassador at Chungking. The
                            questions and their respective answers are set out below.</p>
                        <list>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                            <item>Q. Is the conciliatory policy towards Wang Ching-wei announced
                                    by the Japanese having any appreciable effect on the situation
                                    in Free China?</item>
                            <label/>
                     <item>A. So far as can be judged by His Majesty’s Embassy the new
                                    policy towards the Nanking Government is having little or no
                                    effect in Free China. It is suggested that the Japanese price
                                    control and system of food distribution are, at any rate in
                                    Shanghai and main centers in North China, more effective than
                                    the Chinese system. This is said to be producing some effect in
                                    occupied China. Cases of people returning from Free to occupied
                                    China have always been quite common and this sort of thing is
                                    not regarded in China in the same way as it would be in Europe.
                                    This tendency may increase.</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                            <item>Q. How much substance is there in the Japanese claims of
                                    defections to Nanking on the part of units of the Chungking
                                    forces?</item>
                            <label/>
                     <item>A. There have certainly been cases of defection. In some cases,
                                    for instance in that of General Pang Ping Hsun, it is almost
                                    certain that defection took place only after his force was
                                    surrounded. There have no doubt been some cases when even this
                                    excuse could not be given, but these so far have been confined
                                    to persons of little importance. The Embassy think therefore
                                    that there is some substance in the Japanese claims although
                                    they are no doubt exaggerated.</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                            <item>Q. Is the greater measure of independence which the Japanese
                                    allege that Wang Ching-wei has been given likely to lead to any
                                    form of understanding between Chungking and Nanking?</item>
                            <label/>
                     <item>A. In the view of His Majesty’s Embassy the answer is “no.” There
                                    has always been some contact between the two régimes and this is
                                    maintained but does not appear to grow closer.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Embassy add that there has been improvement in the situation since
                            the recent Japanese setback on the Yangtse front. Isolation of China
                            from the outside world is, as was always expected, producing its
                            inevitable effect. But on the whole the fall in morale is slower than
                            might be expected and if the pressure on the Chinese is not
                            substantially increased they can, the Embassy think, continue resistance
                            on the present scale.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, provided the weight of the Japanese contacts is not
                            substantially increased the maintenance of the present situation seems
                            in the opinion of His Majesty’s Embassy to depend more on crop prospects
                            than on anything else. A Chinese attack on the Japanese may be excluded,
                            so that if it should suit the Japanese to remain quiet, an easy state of
                            undeclared peace might result. Nevertheless, as long as the United
                            States Air Force operates in China the Japanese will presumably have to
                            react and complete quiet on the Chinese front would <pb n="72" xml:id="pg_72" facs="0082"/>apparently be impossible. A serious food
                            shortage if it occurs would probably lead to disturbances which might
                            assume proportions leading to loss of control over wide areas by the
                            Central Government. Present crop prospects are not bad but it is too
                            early to judge.</p>

                    <p>1119. It is an interesting circumstance, although perhaps not of special
                        significance, that a “mass meeting” here last evening July 6 in honor of
                        sixth anniversary of China’s war of resistance held under the auspices of
                        the All-China Troops Comforting Association was organized with the usual
                        habiliments of a United Nations “Big Four” celebration and enjoyed a
                        considerable measure of Soviet participation.</p>
                    <p>Beneath a cluster of small flags of the United Nations high over the stage
                        were hung large Chinese, American, British and Soviet flags and thereunder
                        large colored portraits of Generalissimo, President Roosevelt, Mr. Churchill
                        and Mr. Stalin. Presentation of gifts were made to Chinese Minister of War
                        and some other Chinese officials, General Stilwell, a representative of the
                        head of British Military Mission, and Major General T. Y. Gubarevich
                        described as “Chief Soviet Adviser to the National Government”. The Soviet

                        China and the Chinese troops due to the war and ended his speech with a

                        <p>No. 630. Your telegram of 4th July [<hi rend="italic">30th June?</hi>]
                            has been received. And I am in full accord with your suggestions. Madame
                            Chiang has informed me in detail of her conversations with you. I am
                            delighted with the results and that we see eye to eye on many questions.
                            I anticipate with pleasure our meeting in the near future. For many
                            years I have been wishing that we could discuss together in person
                            various problems of mutual interest. I venture to suggest that any time
                            after September would be most convenient and suitable to you would be
                            possible for me. Should necessity arise, however, for our meeting before
                            then, I should appreciate your letting me know at least a fortnight in
                            advance of my departure.</p>

                    <p>1198. Department’s 892, July 13, 5 [<hi rend="italic">4</hi>] p.m. We are
                        furnishing General Stilwell’s headquarters (General Stilwell is absent from
                        Chungking) paraphrase of our 999, June 23, 9 a.m. The substance of our 1012,
                        June 24, 2 p.m. was previously communicated orally to General Stilwell’s
                        Chief of Staff, General Hearn, and he sent General <pb n="74" xml:id="pg_74" facs="0084"/>Hearn a comprehensive memorandum summarizing the
                        information in that telegram and in subsequent telegrams on same subject. We
                        shall continue to keep General Stilwell or General Hearn fully advised in
                        regard to our information in this and other pertinent matters.</p>
                    <p>It may be added that we some time ago instituted a practice of sending to
                        General Stilwell copies of despatches from OWI field officers on subjects of
                        possible interest and of communicating to him such of our own information as
                        we considered might be of value. We are also sending him copies of our
                        monthly political review and plan as well to furnish him copies of the
                        Embassy’s newly instituted monthly economic review when it has been got
                        under way. Furthermore there is now under discussion a projected formation
                        of a joint intelligence committee to comprise representatives of General
                        Stilwell’s headquarters, the Embassy and BEW. Later we anticipate
                        development in addition of an international intelligence committee out of
                        which it is hoped will accrue benefits to General Stilwell’s headquarters,
                        the Embassy and other American Government agencies here.</p>

                    <p>1221. Department’s 859, July 6, 4 p.m. It is believed that the term “Jap
                        divisions” is correct as, according to the Acting Military Attaché, a number
                        of Jap divisions include units which contain a mixture of Jap and puppet
                        troops including the third division normally based on Hankow which took part
                        in the fighting in June in the Santowping area. Assumption that the puppet
                        members of this and perhaps other units engaged in recent fighting in the
                        Hupeh–Hunan sector was based on information from Chinese intelligence that
                        when the third division, which had been engaged in the 1942 Chekiang-Kiangsi
                        campaign, was reformed in November of that year some of its units were
                        composed of Japs, Koreans and Manchurians in the ratio named.</p>
                    <p>Upon further and considerable detailed inquiry into the matter, it appears
                        that Chinese intelligence has not been consistent in regard to the
                        activities of Manchurian and Nanking puppet troops, possibly because battles
                        and campaigns are almost always colored with much <pb n="75" xml:id="pg_75" facs="0085"/>propaganda. Admiral Yang now states that he does not think
                        that any Manchurian puppets participated in the recent Hupeh–Hunan fighting
                        but that Nanking troops were employed by the Japs for “secondary defense
                        duties” which in most cases comprised the guarding of supply lines and
                        garrison duties. He names specifically the twenty-ninth Nanking puppet
                        division as having guarded supply lines and states that this division has
                        Jap officers acting in advisory and staff capacities down to and including
                        the infantry company and that only “a few if any” Koreans are among the
                        staff and advisory officers. There are stories in regard to the Hupeh–Hunan
                        fighting to the effect that some of the puppets furnished intelligence to
                        Central Government troops which facilitated the bombing of Jap supply lines;
                        that some puppets deserted to the Central Government, and that others broke
                        under attack and caused Jap retirements. These stories have not been
                        confirmed but it is generally accepted that the Japs were weakened because
                        of the number and character of puppet troops either operating as distinct
                        puppet units or as component parts of Jap contingents.</p>
                    <p>Reverting to the question of the presence of Manchurian troops in Central
                        China, the Acting Military Attaché has furnished us a summary of a memo by
                        Chinese G–2<note n="92" xml:id="d62fn92">Military Intelligence.</note> dated
                        January 14, ’43, in regard to “enemy trained Chosen, Formosan and Manchurian
                        troops” in which is mentioned (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) a report dated
                        November 16, ’42 from General Chen Cheng (Chinese commander in the recent
                        Hupeh–Hunan operations) that the “elite” [Japanese?] troops in the Wuhan
                        area had been replaced by mixed troops of Japs, Koreans, Formosans and
                        Manchurians; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) that on November 17, ’42 the third
                        Jap division was replenished after the Chekiang–Kiangsi campaign on the
                        basis of 1 Jap, 3 Koreans and 6 Manchurians; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)
                        that, according to a report from General Chen Cheng dated December 5, ’42,
                        many Manchurians were in the Jap thirty-ninth division (portions of which
                        also took part in the recent fighting); that on January 2, ’43 some 20,000
                        troops arrived at Chinkiang from the northeast on December 4, ’42 and that
                        about 30 per cent of them were Japs and 70 per cent Manchurians.</p>
                    <p>It would seem from these reports that considerable numbers of Manchurian
                        soldiers intermixed individually or by groups with Jap troops have at some
                        time had station or have operated in Central China. As for the recent
                        campaign, it would seem that the puppet troops engaged therein, as far as
                        they have [been] identified, were Nanking puppets.</p>

                    <p>1231. We were informed by good authority some time ago that Chiang Kai-shek
                        had drawn up 21 regulations for the conduct of Chinese; that among them was
                        one to the effect that Chinese associating too much with foreigners be put
                        under surveillance as a first step; that General Chiang instructed Dr. Wang
                        Chung-hui, one time Foreign Minister and now Secretary General, National
                        Defense Council, to have the regulations circulated to certain officials and
                        to see that they were enforced; but that Wang had successfully argued
                        against their enforcement, especially the regulation relating to association
                        with foreigners.</p>
                    <p>In an airgram dated July 12 the Consul at Kweilin<note n="93" xml:id="d63fn93">Arthur R. Ringwalt.</note> indicates that he has
                        positive information of the Chinese Government in June having issued
                        instructions to officials in Kwangtung and Kwangsi and that in future only
                        Chinese specially trained and qualified would be authorized to treat with
                        foreigners and that those not specially designated who continued to
                        associate with foreigners would be placed under surveillance. Ringwalt
                        states: “In the preamble to the instruction it was pointed out that foreign
                        military and civilian officials were arriving in China [in] vastly
                        increasing numbers, and the view was expressed that, provided no
                        precautionary steps were taken, the foreigners might be given false and
                        misleading information and might thus be unable to obtain a true picture of
                        conditions in China. Local Chinese critical of the administration in
                        Chungking profess to be convinced that the Chinese have fears above all that
                        the American public may become aware of the true state of affairs in China,
                        and that American public opinion in respect of China may undergo a severe
                        action from wholehearted and uncritical admiration and sympathy to apathy
                        and cynicism. Whatever may have been the purpose of the instruction issued
                        by the Executive Yuan, the results in Kwangsi have not been entirely happy.
                        The more timid of the officials who might be in possession of accurate
                        knowledge and be able to be of great assistance to this Consulate in
                        preparing its reports are now out of town or ill whenever a member of the
                        consular staff attempts to visit them, and the more brazen, fortified by the
                        presumption that they will be protected in case they get into trouble, are
                        inclined to retail to all who will listen every rumor, true or false, which
                        may tend to place the Chinese Government in a bad light. Accurate, unbiased
                        information is becoming increasingly difficult to acquire.”</p>

                    <p>The Embassy is inquiring of the Consulate whether it has, actually, positive
                        information in the premises. Meanwhile, it is pertinent to comment that the
                        report that the Generalissimo has drawn up regulations of such nature is in
                        itself a somewhat ominous indication of a trend that seems to be
                        increasingly followed by reactionary leaders in China. (See Embassy’s 999,
                        June 23, 9 a.m., in regard to censorship; 995, June 22, 4 p.m.,<note n="94" xml:id="d63fn94">Not printed.</note> in regard to the Generalissimo’s
                        book <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>; and despatch no. 1355, July
                            17,<note n="94" xml:id="d63fn95">Not printed.</note> on the subject of
                        the police surveillance of foreigners at Sian which are unhappily
                        reminiscent of traditional Jap police methods.)</p>
                    <p>There appears to be little open surveillance of foreigners at Chungking.
                        Occasionally foreigners are stopped on the streets by police agents and
                        asked to identify themselves and we are informed that General Tai Li has
                        agents among the servants of the various diplomatic missions, including
                        ours, to keep a check on visitors and to pick up what information may be
                        garnered from conversations and waste baskets. At the time of the report of
                        the drawing up by the Generalissimo of his 21 regulations, a Chinese
                        organization which had arranged a tea party for the foreign correspondents
                        here suddenly canceled its invitations.</p>
                    <p>Whether or not such regulations have been issued, we have been aware for some
                        time that our Chinese friends (especially those below the highest brackets
                        of rank) are far less given to frank discussion of China’s international,
                        political and economic problems than formerly and that anything in the
                        nature of criticism of the Chinese Government or its leaders is rarely heard
                        except from a very few of the higher personages such as Dr. Sun Fo who, as
                        the son of Sun Yat Sen, seems to feel that he can afford occasionally in a
                        mild way to speak his mind. Another liberal, Sun Yat Sen’s widow, is also
                        not always backward in speaking in private, somewhat frankly on some
                        subjects to her friends, but she is cautious and is apparently under some
                        forms of restraint. Mme. Sun has told me, for example, that she has wanted
                        to go to Lanchow for the summer but that she was afraid that “permission”
                        would not be given; and she so far continues to remain in Chungking. In the
                        course of a conversation, Dr. Wang Chung-hui asked me what I thought of
                        China upon my return after 4 years, and when I mentioned in the course of my
                        reply that I was somewhat surprised and a little disturbed at the seemingly
                        increasing trends toward Fascist practices he said with some confusion that
                        some minor things were necessary in wartime and hastily changed the
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>We shall expect in due course to report further to the Department on
                        developments in this general trend.</p>

                    <p>A–22. There are persistent reports, largely from foreign news correspondents,
                        that Madame Chiang Kai-shek has returned to this country with something of
                        an anti-American bias. The principal basis for this alleged feeling on her
                        part is assumed to be that she did not as a result of her visit obtain from
                        the American Government all that she wanted or all that Mr. Willkie promised
                        her. Other and somewhat vague reasons ascribed are that because of some
                        development or developments in the United States during the latter part of
                        her visit she “realized” that she had overstayed her time and made one or
                        two speeches too many; also, that the unfortunate circumstances of her
                        homecoming after a hazardous and tiring journey during which she was airsick
                        a great part of the time (Embassy’s 1091, July 5, 10 a.m.<note n="95" xml:id="d67fn95">Not printed.</note>) increased her sense of
                        disappointment and frustration.</p>

                    <p>A–23. Embassy’s airgram No. A–22, August 2, 9 a.m. Hollington Tong, Vice
                        Minister of Information, who accompanied Madame Chiang to the United States,
                        is reliably reported by a number of sources to have stated since his return
                        to Chungking that he found “no war spirit” in Washington, a very curious
                        remark to come from a resident of Chungking. The correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> is one of those who has informed us
                        that he has of late sensed a definite anti-American atmosphere in some
                        Chinese official circles in Chungking. He states that the Chinese resented
                        the Institute of Pacific Relations article mentioned in our 1291, July 24,
                        midnight, 1943, and also a recent article in the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Times</hi> by Hanson Baldwin on the military situation in the Far East
                        in which Mr. Baldwin stated among other things that Sino-Japanese skirmishes
                        were magnified by the Chinese as large battles. (The military spokesman at a
                        press conference <pb n="81" xml:id="pg_81" facs="0091"/>recently attempted
                        to refute statements in the Baldwin article and his remarks were later
                        widely distributed in printed form.) During the past week at a press
                        conference the correspondents were given a lecture by the Information
                        Minister in regard to their reporting and the United Press correspondent
                        states that he was recently told by an important Chinese official that the
                        American correspondents in China “had done China more harm than good” by
                        their reporting activities since the outbreak of Sino-Japanese hostilities
                        in 1937. Inquiries by foreign correspondents in regard to the
                        Kuomintang-Communist situation have been obviously resented by Chinese press
                        and other Party line officials.</p>
                    <p>The assumption of one competent observer is that Party line officials, in
                        their attempt to build a new Great Wall of censorship about the
                        deteriorating situation in China, are becoming more and more resentful
                        against Americans and the United States because of their own—and typical
                        present day Chinese—intolerance of the slightest criticism and because of
                        their fear—and perhaps realization—that heavy criticism of the Chinese
                        Government is probably inevitable when the truth becomes known. A tragic
                        aspect of these circumstances is, in the Embassy’s opinion, the possibility
                        that American public disillusionment in regard to China, if and when it
                        occurs, may be so great that it may becloud China’s virtues in the minds of
                        China’s friends who have been most effective in furthering Chinese hopes for
                        continuing and increased aid, thus losing to China the help China needs and
                        to us the war potentialities which this country holds—or should hold—for our
                        cause. (Please see Embassy’s 1357, August 2, noon,<note n="96" xml:id="d68fn96">

                    <p>At weekly press conference July 28, Government spokesmen in heated off record
                        comments branded Bisson’s allusions to “two Chinas”—“democratic” Communist
                        China and “feudalistic” Kuomintang China—as completely false. Said Bisson
                        either completely misinformed or had malicious intent toward China. Said
                        Institute of Pacific Relations for past year had been growing steadily more
                        anti-China.</p>

                        withdrawing privilege of transmitting material free to IPR over XGO Y. Later
                        one Ministry official was overheard remarking that as a result of Bisson
                        article and IPR attitude “it will be very embarrassing” for Bisson’s
                        Secretary Edward C. Carter<note n="1" xml:id="d69fn1">Secretary General,

                        visit.</p>
                    <p>Baldwin article was cited at press conference as another example of how
                        American writers seem to want to hurt China. His assertion that Chinese
                        military communiqués could not be believed was especially irritating.
                        Spokesman professed to be puzzled why despite all aid Allies had given China
                        foreign writers persisted in “throwing mud in China’s face.”</p>
                    <p>In July 23rd press conference spokesman read prepared criticism of Baldwin’s
                        article. Neither article nor criticism were published locally, but July 24th
                            <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> editorially attacked article’s
                        derogatory reference to western Hupeh fighting.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, Baldwin’s article in <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi> was
                        splashed by Domei which officials here see and doubtless exacerbated
                        official sensibilities. Japanese propaganda to China during the past few
                        days has seized gleefully on both articles as typical of racial superiority
                        Americans feel toward “all Asiatics”. The implied sympathy reversed their
                        original line that the articles represented the real truth about Free
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Contrasted to official Chinese reaction, private conversations with fairly
                        representative intellectuals, none of whom even suspected of leftist
                        tendencies, indicate considerable quiet satisfaction over these and Pearl
                        Buck’s article in May 10 <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>. A minor Government
                        official, Kuomintang member trained in America, said he welcomed such
                        criticism in America since nobody dared offer slightest criticism here.
                        Although Baldwin’s assertions in some cases are exaggerated there is such
                        dissatisfaction with things as they are that little exception was taken to
                        these points.</p>
                    <p>We do not seek to influence this critical tendency in American press but
                        offer the observations that it gives Axis propaganda an excellent divisive
                        wedge and that criticism would be more effective if it coincided <pb n="83" xml:id="pg_83" facs="0093"/>with a successful operation in Burma or
                        really large scale victories in the Pacific.</p>

                        the Kuomintang-Communist situation and promised to see that Mr. Atkinson
                        received permission to report on the situation to the <hi rend="italic">New

                        interprets this statement to mean that he would be allowed to send only a
                        one-sided “Kuomintang” story; he states that he has no intention of writing
                        and forwarding to his paper a propaganda article of that nature.</p>
                    <p>At the instance of Mr. Gunther Stein, Mr. Atkinson and his two colleagues
                        questioned Dr. Tong in regard to the ban placed on Stein’s filing despatches
                        for IPR because of the T. A. Bisson story in a recent issue of the <hi rend="italic">Far Eastern Survey</hi> critical of the Kuomintang. Dr.
                        Tong said that pending the receipt of some explanation from IPR, in which
                        China felt that she was to a certain extent a “stockholder”, Mr. Stein would
                        not be permitted to use Chinese radio facilities which are made available
                        once each week to foreign correspondents free of charge for a so-called
                        “Voice” broadcast of a story. Mr. Stein will be permitted to send material
                        by mail and by Press Wireless (IPR cannot pay cable charges).</p>

                        informed of developments in London which might be of interest to us in
                        relation to the Far East. He handed me an informal memorandum which dealt
                        with a conversation between Dr. Soong and Mr. Eden on July 28, 1943. It
                        reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Dr. Soong said that the Burma Campaign was the most important and
                                most immediate question for China. He also declared <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that China had no territorial
                                ambitions but he hoped we should recognize that Tibet was part of
                                the Chinese dominions. The Secretary of State replied that our
                                attitude had been that Tibet must be recognized to have autonomy
                                under Chinese suzerainty. It was eventually agreed that we should
                                state our position in regard to Tibet in a confidential
                                    memorandum.<note n="4" xml:id="d71fn4">For further

                            <p>“Mr. Eden, in response to a question about the British Government’s
                                ideas on collective security for the future, having outlined those
                                ideas then assured Dr. Soong that one of the aims of the post-war
                                system envisaged by the United Kingdom was to restrain Japanese
                                aggression and to see a strong China. The British government would
                                make their full contribution to those ends.”</p>

                        George pointed out that in that address Mr. Anthony Eden had stated: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>“Such suggestions are no doubt intended to be mischievous.</p>
                            <p>“They are, in fact, ludicrous, and I am sure that our Chinese friends

                                in the existence of a strong and united China.</p>
                            <p>“So it has been in the past, so it will be in the future.</p>
                            <p>“Without a strong and united China there is no prospect of lasting

                            <p>The form of economic warfare waged by the Japanese against south
                                China is simple and effective. By offering generous profits, they
                                are able to obtain enormous and increasing quantities of foodstuffs
                                and raw materials in exchange for superfluous manufactured goods,
                                including looted products, and depreciated and often counterfeit
                                currency. In this activity, they are abetted by unscrupulous Chinese
                                merchants and corrupt Chinese officials. The apparent major aim of
                                the Japanese, in which they have been conspicuously successful, has
                                been to create an artificial food shortage through blockade of
                                imports, <pb n="86" xml:id="pg_86" facs="0096"/>hoarding, and
                                leakage to occupied territory, thus bringing about malignant
                                inflation and resultant economic depression. The Japanese scheme of
                                economic warfare in south China has been as demoralizing as a
                                military occupation and successful results have been achieved at a
                                minimum cost in men and money.</p>

                    <p>Attention is invited to the last paragraph of page two of the despatch, in
                        which the Consul comments on the smuggling of salt and wolfram from the

                        appears: “Competent official observers of the U. S. Government have even
                        reported having seen wolfram laden trucks owned by the National Resources
                        Commission making their way eastward from the railhead at Kukong.” The
                        Embassy is instructing the Consul to investigate further.</p>

                    <p>1435. The latest report of Japanese peace maneuvers is (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) that a Chinese, so far identified only by surname Liu, came
                        here from Shanghai a week ago with a proposal that if the Generalissimo
                        would consent to discussing peace terms, the Japanese as an earnest would
                        withdraw from Canton and vicinity and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the
                        Generalissimo replied that he would not give consideration to the proposal
                        unless the Japanese should also withdraw from Hankow and vicinity. This
                        story comes to us through a very reliable channel from an authoritative
                        source. For that reason, we give it some credence and also because it is not
                        improbable that the Japanese, in the light of developments in Europe and
                        Southwest Pacific, may be seriously exploring ways to resolve the “China
                        incident” by political means and that they have endeavored to lay ground
                        work therefore by their so-called “soft policy” toward [Nanking].</p>
                    <p>The last most recent report of Japanese peace proposals was connected with Wu
                        Kai-hsien who is now said to have returned to Nanking (Embassy’s airgram
                        A–28, August 4).<note n="9" xml:id="d73fn9">

                        informant the Generalissimo, while having no thought of making any kind of
                        peace with Japanese, sometimes gives the appearance of not being unreceptive
                        to such proposals because the fact that they are made to him gives him,
                        against the background of the generally deteriorating <pb n="87" xml:id="pg_87" facs="0097"/>situation here, a sense of power. We are
                        inclined to give credence to this explanation. We consider the matter of
                        interest chiefly because it may offer a sidelight upon the possible lines of
                        thought which circumstances [are?] impelling Japanese leaders to follow.</p>

                                reaction here to Hanson Baldwin’s article in the August <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi> until we could submit
                                something fairly definitive.</p>
                            <p>This article, following Baldwin’s <hi rend="italic">New York
                                    Times</hi> article critical of China’s military effort, the IPR
                                article (our 1291) and Pearl Buck’s in <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>
                                about May 13, has caused resentment that is deep and bitter in some
                                of the highest circles and is widespread in varying degrees. It has
                                been the subject of much discussion among higher officials, of a
                                special meeting of Cabinet Ministers and party heads, and of
                                conferences between various officials and the Generalissimo and
                                Madame Chiang. The importance attached to it is also indicated by
                                Madame Chiang’s press statement of August 11. Baldwin’s repetition
                                of the well known Japanese propaganda line that China is a
                                geographic area and not a nation was especially exasperating to the
                                Chinese. On the other hand, as indicated by Fisher, the legitimate
                                criticism in the article has caused some quiet satisfaction in the
                                more liberal quarters.</p>
                            <p>Such criticism came as a great shock to reactionary Government and
                                party leaders who are used to hearing China overpraised and many of
                                whom have complacently believed that Americans at home were
                                completely duped by Chinese censorship (Embassy’s 999, June 23) and
                                propaganda (including the propaganda of Madame Chiang’s visit) and
                                that we, no less than the British, would do almost anything in
                                wooing of China to keep her in war which, for her own sake, she has
                                no intention of abandoning.</p>
                            <p>As example of the extremes in the situation, the Information Minister
                                when discussing the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> article on one
                                occasion was virtually hysterical and his usual fluent English
                                became unintelligible gibberish. Vice Foreign Minister Hoo, a
                                cosmopolitan and experienced diplomat, accuses Baldwin of furthering
                                alleged U. S. Navy desires to divert to <pb n="88" xml:id="pg_88" facs="0098"/>the southwest Pacific aid being sent to China.
                                Others attribute the article to a campaign against repeal of the
                                Exclusion Act.<note n="10" xml:id="d74fn10">See <ref target="#pg_769">pp. 769</ref> ff.</note>
               </p>
                        <p>2. In our opinion there is considerable possibility that continued public
                            criticism will have adverse effect on our relations with the Chinese
                            Government in that it will likely increase the present antiforeign bias
                            which the Generalissimo, Madame Chiang (airgram A–22, August 2) and
                            others seem to have and will turn that bias more and more in our
                            direction.</p>
                        <p>3. In the expectation that Baldwin’s and the other articles may create
                                widespread discussion in American editorial columns and perhaps
                                bring forth further comment critical of China, we venture to suggest
                                that the adverse effect upon our relations might be to some extent
                                counteracted, and that any possible good effects upon the Chinese
                                Government of such criticism might be enhanced, by the issuing by
                                the Department of an informal statement which might take cognizance,
                                in a restrained way, (1) of the unfair aspects of general criticism
                                of the Chinese Government for the situation which various
                                circumstances and factors have conspired to develop, (2) of our own
                                relationship to the cutting off, through our involvement in the war,
                                of the Burma channel to the outside world which is generally
                                considered the cause of some of China’s major economic difficulties
                                and which is a lasting cause of Chinese resentment against us, (3)
                                of our expectations of China now and during the war, and (4) of our
                                (necessary) confidence in the future with respect to China: that is,
                                a statement which, by deprecating the criticism, will tend to
                                preserve our relations on a sincerely friendly basis and which, by
                                showing that our Government is fully aware of conditions in China
                                and of the implications in those conditions, might thereby have some
                                beneficial effects on those Chinese leaders who have become content
                                to sit back and wait for us to win the war for them as well as for
                                ourselves.</p>
                            <p>From the point of view of our observation here, we respectfully
                                suggest that such a statement might generally be along lines as
                                follows: that it is easy to be critical of a distant ally in regard
                                to whose serious problems the American newswriters and public have
                                received little accurate information, that such criticism does not
                                further the general war effort, especially when not constructive;
                                that for 6 years Chinese people have made untold sacrifices to
                                maintain national existence against a ruthless and modernly equipped
                                enemy; that the United States was attacked by Japan because we
                                refused to sacrifice a principle involving China’s interests but of
                                course we do not hold this against China and the existence in China
                                now of internal <pb n="89" xml:id="pg_89" facs="0099"/>economic and
                                other war time problems does not to any degree make us less friendly
                                toward China but rather increases our own determination to continue
                                and increase our aid; that we appreciate the contribution to war
                                effort which China has already made and have full faith in the
                                ability of China’s leaders to increase that effort and make it more
                                effective; that we have faith in the fundamental democracy of
                                Chinese people and in the ultimate wisdom of China’s leaders in
                                their task of rebuilding a war torn nation [following?] the
                                democratic principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; that we confidently expect
                                that when the inevitable victory is won by increased exertion and
                                sacrifice on the part of China as well as on our and the other
                                Allies’ part, the Chinese nation will achieve its deserved place in
                                the post-war family of collaborating nations.</p>

                    <p>1457. Embassy’s 1435, August 12, 3 p.m. Some competent observers here are of
                        the opinion that, in giving consideration to reports of Japanese peace
                        feelers on proposals, we should not be unmindful that since before the
                        outbreak of Sino-Jap hostilities there have been and will continue to be
                        Government officials, who favor the making of some kind of compromise with
                        Japan and that their attitude and activities cannot be completely
                        disregarded at any important juncture, (1) because of the anti-western bias
                        of the Generalissimo, Madame Chiang and a number of the reactionary leaders
                        of the Government and (2) because of widespread suspicion in Chinese
                        Government circles that Great Britain will not, after the crushing of
                        Germany, devote her naval and other resources wholeheartedly to the defeat
                        of Japan, thus making a compromise peace between the Anglo-American Allies
                        and Japan probable (this suspicion extends also in some quarters to the
                        intentions of the United States).</p>

                        been mentioned to us, expressly in connection with the visit of Liu reported

                                    Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, participated in the discussions.
                                    For joint statement by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
                                    Churchill, August 24, regarding the Conference, see Department

                            <p>London and Moscow press dispatches received here indicate that Stalin
                                has been invited but that he has expressed ‘regret’ that he will not
                                be able to attend owing to the present summer offensive. There <pb n="91" xml:id="pg_91" facs="0101"/>is still a lot of suspicion
                                and distrust of Russia here and Moscow’s aloofness has caused much
                                speculation and apprehension. The same old argument is advanced for
                                Stalin’s absence: ‘Moscow is not inclined to risk complications with
                                Japan since she is still at peace with Tokyo. By taking part in the
                                proceedings which most logically will include the Pacific war front
                                as well as the European theater.’</p>
                            <p>It is further pointed out by some critics that Stalin’s absence
                                suggests a basic lack of understanding among the United Nations
                                members on the political aims of the post-war period. From this it
                                appears that there would be less misunderstanding if there were a
                                full agreement exchanged between China and the other Anglo-American
                                Allies.”</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Reference is made to the
                        Department’s letter of July 26, 1943<note n="14" xml:id="d78fn14">See
                            footnote 81, <ref target="#pg_68">p. 68</ref>.</note> in which this
                        Department informed the War Department that in pursuance of the latter’s
                        request assignments had been approved for detail to the staff of Lieutenant
                        General Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding General of the United States Army
                        Forces in the China–Burma–India theater, of four Foreign Service officers
                        named in the letter.</p>
                    <p>The Department feels that these assignments will assist General Stilwell in
                        his theater of war in evaluating and in dealing with political aspects of
                        military problems by providing him with the services of personnel who have
                        had special training and experience in areas within his command.</p>
                    <p>In this connection and in view of the importance of these political questions
                        and of the close inter-relation between political and military problems
                        especially in the areas in question, the Department is of the opinion that
                        all possible steps should be taken to ensure complete coordination and
                        cooperation between the diplomatic and military establishments in political
                        matters related to military affairs.</p>
                    <p>The Department feels that, in addition to the assigning of these officers to
                        General Stilwell’s staff, much further good can be accomplished in this
                        direction by arranging for the direct exchange at frequent and regular
                        intervals of views and of information between General Stilwell and the
                        ranking political representatives of the United States in India and in
                        China. The obvious benefits which would be derived from frank and
                        comprehensive interchanges of the nature envisaged should be of great
                        assistance to both establishments <pb n="92" xml:id="pg_92" facs="0102"/>in
                        discharging their respective functions in connection with the prosecution of
                        the war and the working out of our long-range policies in that area.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes, therefore, that it is of the utmost importance that
                        the Commanding General of United States forces in the China–Burma–India
                        theater and the ranking American political representatives in that area
                        should arrange for constant liaison and regular consultation one with the
                        other to the end that coordination and cooperation be maintained between the
                        diplomatic and military establishments in China and India of this Government
                        in political matters relating to military affairs. For example, the
                        Department believes that the ends in view might be well served if General
                        Stilwell would maintain liaison and confer with the American Ambassador at
                        Chungking in regard to matters affecting political relations with China and
                        similarly with the Chief of the American Mission at New Delhi in regard to
                        matters affecting political relations with India.</p>
                    <p>The Department will instruct the American Ambassador at Chungking and the
                        Chief of the American Mission at New Delhi to take all necessary steps to
                        work out arrangements for such liaison and conferences with General Stilwell
                        at which all questions of mutual concern will be thoroughly explored and
                        discussed. At the same time and for the same purpose the Department requests
                        that the War Department issue appropriate instructions to General Stilwell
                        in the foregoing sense.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>Dr. T. V. Soong, Foreign Minister of China, called at his request, having
                        just returned from London. I inquired as to how he felt about the results of
                        his visit. He promptly said that he thought they were good and that he was
                        much encouraged by his trip. He stated that, while the British are not
                        idealistic like the United States and some other countries, they did show a
                        prompt disposition to discuss frankly and reasonably each and all questions
                        that were presented to them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that his Government feels that the four great nations largely
                        directing the war should have their unity made a reality by taking China
                        into the military and other conferences and that his Government is very
                        earnest in this plea.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister then said that he was most desirous to take up with the
                        British the question as to their plans to open up the Burma <pb n="93" xml:id="pg_93" facs="0103"/>area, primarily from the standpoint of
                        China. He stated that the British had agreed to engage in certain further
                        military movements, but he did not undertake to be specific as to just where
                        and in what particular territory. Dr. Soong said that his Government felt
                        very strongly that it should be consulted about any fighting with Japan, or
                        plans for fighting with Japan. I stated that this question is one of a
                        military nature and does not come within my function. He then requested me
                        to speak to the President about these matters, especially about his
                        Government’s desire that the Burma area be opened up, and I said I would be
                        pleased to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister then said that his Government felt that it should be a
                        member of the committee which deals with munitions assignments; that in
                        Great Britain they are even proposing to take in some other European
                        countries, including the French Committee of National Liberation; whereas
                        China, one of the four large nations, is not a member.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said off the record that he had secured an agreement with the
                        Government of Canada to furnish China with 60,000 tons of munitions; that
                        these munitions were not susceptible of use by the United States or Great
                        Britain, but that Mr. Lauchlin Currie had prevailed on the Canadian
                        Government to abandon her agreement by saying that China was in a confused
                        state at present, et cetera, and that the Government of Canada had so
                        informed him.</p>
                    <p>I told the Minister that we looked upon China as having great potential
                        strength and development, politically, economically, et cetera, and that
                        that development is reasonably certain in the not distant future, and that,
                        therefore, we are showing China every consideration at all practicable. Dr.
                        Soong said that this was true, but that some other countries like Great
                        Britain do not seem to have that idea.</p>

                            <item>On many occasions the United States Government has declared it to

                                United States, Great Britain, the U. S. S. R. and China, which are
                                bearing the main burden of the war effort, shall also assume the
                                responsibility for the conduct of the war and for the maintenance of

                                agreement, that relating to Relief and Rehabilitation, was being
                                elaborated, the four Governments, upon the invitation of the U. S.
                                Department of State, entered into protracted discussions and secured
                                agreement amongst themselves before the draft instrument was
                                presented to other United Nations.</item>

                                British Governments. On no major issue, however, either relative to
                                the conduct of the war or to preparations for the future peace, has
                                this practice been followed so far.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>

                                    war and for the preparation of the transition from war to peace,
                                    and in each case their membership was limited to United States
                                    and British representatives, although these agencies are assumed

                                    participation in these agencies have met with negative replies.

                                    China’s case is under deliberation before these agencies. On the

                                    statements before the Combined Chiefs of Staff, they were heard
                                    rather as witnesses and did not participate in the actual
                                    deliberations, nor were they parties to the final

                        <p>Many months ago the Chinese Government approached the Canadian Government
                            for aid in supplying munitions under their Mutual Aid Plan. A definite
                            program, embracing nearly 60,000 tons of ordnance and supplies for the
                            next year, was mutually agreed upon between myself representing the
                            Chinese Government, and Mr. Howe, the Canadian Minister of Munitions.
                            The program received the official sanction of the Canadian Government,
                            and orders have been actually placed by them.</p>
                        <pb n="96" xml:id="pg_96" facs="0106"/>
                        <p>None of these munitions would involve taking away any essential supply of
                            munitions required by the U. S. or British armies. Shipping for these
                            supplies to India (where the Chinese Government intend to keep a stock
                            pile of these goods until the Burma Road or some alternate route, such
                            as the Iranian Highway through Central Asia, could be developed) are
                            likewise available.</p>
                        <p>On various pretexts, technicalities were advanced by the American
                            authorities through Dr. Lauchlin Currie to have the Canadian Government
                            either stop or curtail these supplies.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary is earnestly requested to approach the President to give
                            instructions that all objections, which are indeed not in line with the
                            broad and generous friendship of the United States for China, be

                    <p>I called on Dr. Soong at his home last evening, and there ensued between us a
                        lengthy conversation.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that he had enjoyed his recent trip to London. He said that he
                        had acquired for the first time confidence that the British could be relied
                        on to fight with full vigor until victory over the Japanese has been gained;
                        they have given him emphatic assurances and have explained to him their
                        plans and intentions; he was sure that they had abandoned their erstwhile
                        political affection for the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>In continuance Dr. Soong made a very interesting observation to the effect
                        that discussion of policies and procedures with the British is very
                        different from discussion of similar subjects with American officialdom.
                        Americans, he said, begin with principles and discuss possibilities and
                        courses in the light thereof, with a certain emotional accompaniment. The
                        British, he said, are matter-of-fact, “realistic”, unemotional and they have
                        constantly in mind the question of <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that he had had a conversation with the Secretary yesterday,
                        earlier in the day, and that he wanted to inform me about something of which
                        he had given the Secretary an account. He then gave me an account of the
                        agreement which he had made with the Canadian Government for the supplying
                        to China of 60,000 tons of military materials and of interference by certain
                        American officials or officers—of which account I have made record in a
                        separate memorandum.<note n="16" xml:id="d81fn16">Not printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <pb n="97" xml:id="pg_97" facs="0107"/>
                    <p>I then said that, not having had a chat with Dr. Soong for some time, I had
                        accumulated several topics regarding which I wished to speak to him.</p>
                    <p>I handed him a copy of a press report from a Russian source in which
                        examination was made and emphasis was laid on an estimate that 38,000,000
                        Russians had had to leave their homes in consequence of the ravages of war
                        on the German front. I also handed him a copy of an excerpt from a radio
                        bulletin wherein attention had been called to the disparity in numbers
                        between personnel of British Foreign Services and personnel of Chinese
                        Foreign Services. Dr. Soong commented on this to the effect that the Chinese
                        Diplomatic Service was terribly short-handed, especially in the lower
                        brackets and the clerical fields, and he remarked that China must give
                        attention to the training of adequate personnel.</p>
                    <p>I then said that there had been recently, as Dr. Soong probably had noticed,
                        a great deal of “chatter” in some quarters about alleged tension between the
                        Chinese National Government and the Chinese Communists. Dr. Soong remarked
                        that he had observed this. I said that Dr. Soong would remember a
                        conversation which he and Ambassador Hu Shih and Mr. Hamilton and I had had
                        many months ago<note n="17" xml:id="d81fn17">See memorandum of March 7,

                        that subject. Dr. Soong said that he recalled that conversation. I said that
                        the feeling of the Department of State about the whole matter was now what
                        it had been then: that Dr. Soong would perhaps recall that Mr. Earl
                            Browder<note n="18" xml:id="d81fn18">General Secretary of the Communist
                            Party in the United States.</note> had made some charges against the
                        Department of State some months ago in relation to this subject, and that
                        the Under Secretary had talked to Mr. Browder,<note n="19" xml:id="d81fn19">October 12, 1942; for correspondence, see <ref target="frus1942China#pg_244">

                        refuted those charges, had stated what was this Government’s attitude, and
                        that Mr. Browder had thereupon made a retraction. Dr. Soong said that he
                        remembered this also. I said that we had recently received information from
                        Chungking that an official agent of another power had alleged to an American
                        officer that the American and the British Governments were urgently pressing
                        upon the Chinese Government a course of action regarding the Communists; and
                        that I wanted to say that any allegation that the American Government was
                        thus proceeding was false. I then gave Dr. Soong a copy of the statement
                        which Mr. Welles had made to Mr. Browder; and I said that that statement was
                        accurately expressive of the official opinion of the American Government;
                        that so far as the Department of State is concerned we do not entertain
                        apprehension of an armed clash in the near future between <pb n="98" xml:id="pg_98" facs="0108"/>the Chinese National Government and the
                        Chinese Communists; that we have never concealed expression of hope on our
                        part that civil strife in China—as elsewhere—will be avoided, but we have
                        scrupulously refrained from urging upon the Chinese Government any
                        particular course of action in connection with or in regard to matters of
                        Chinese international politics. Dr. Soong said that he was sure that he had
                        for some time past accurately understood the official position of the
                        American Government on these points. He said that some weeks ago a highly
                        placed American military authority (whom he named) had informed him of
                        receipt by that office of a report circumstantially stating that the Chinese
                        National Government was planning to make an attack on the Chinese Communists
                        on or about August 15, and that that officer, who is friendly to China, had
                        expressed to him, Soong, solicitude and had emphasized the detriment that
                        would accrue to the position and effort of the United Nations were a civil
                        armed conflict to break out in China. Dr. Soong said that this officer had
                        spoken in good faith and with good intent on the basis of misinformation
                        given him from some source which must in turn have been misinformed. He,
                        Soong, wondered whether these things originated from Russian sources. He,
                        Soong, could assure me that the National Government has no present intention
                        of forcing the issue with the Communists. He, Soong, felt no present
                        uneasiness on this score. And, he, Soong, appreciated the State Department’s
                        calm view and correct attitude regarding the subject.</p>
                    <p>I then said that there was another matter about which there had recently
                        been, unfortunately, a good deal of unnecessary, not to say harmful,
                        “chatter”: namely, a small flood of critical articles expatiating
                        unfavorably on the subject of Chinese military performance and capacities. I
                        mentioned several such articles and asked whether Dr. Soong had read them.
                        In each case Dr. Soong replied in the affirmative. I then asked whether he
                        had read Rodney Gilbert’s two articles of recent date in the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi>. Dr. Soong replied that he
                        had, and that he was pleased with and especially interested in those
                        articles because he remembered that some years ago Mr. Gilbert had written a
                        book severely critical of China. There followed some discussion of the
                        points of view of some of the writers under reference, the substance of some
                        of the articles, and the sources and the motivation of various of the
                        statements which they carried. In the course of this discussion, Dr. Soong
                        mentioned Mr. Gilbert’s comments upon military observers and mentioned
                        critically one American officer by name. I said that I had brought this
                        subject up in order to suggest to Dr. Soong that, although this little flood
                        of adverse criticism must be and is known to be distasteful to the Chinese,
                        especially in official <pb n="99" xml:id="pg_99" facs="0109"/>circles in
                        Chungking, it ought not be taken too seriously; it must be remembered that a
                        number of Chinese have said a lot of harshly critical things about the
                        United States during recent years and especially since Pearl Harbor; that it
                        must also be recalled that there has existed in Chungking a pretty severe
                        censorship, in the presence of which, when news critical in character does
                        leak out, there is a tendency for publicists to make the most of it; and
                        that the thing that is really important is not what a few critics say but
                        what is the opinion of those persons in official circles who have the
                        responsibility of making decisions. I suggested that Dr. Soong suggest to
                        his official associates that we must all try to see these things in
                        perspective and on balance. I remarked that the Chinese censorship
                        apparently tries to impose some worthwhile restrictions, for instance the
                        prohibition upon export of Chinese criticism of allies; and I said that I
                        wished our censorship might be as effective in a similar direction as it is
                        in some perhaps less important fields. Dr. Soong appeared to be arriving at
                        a revised concept of what should be the Chinese reaction to the type of
                        criticism which was under discussion. I endeavored to clinch the point by
                        referring to the traditional impression that the Chinese as a nation react
                        cheerfully or with indifference to criticism which they believe to be
                        unwarranted, in contrast to the hyper-sensitiveness of a near neighbor of
                        theirs which has been terrifically sensitive to any and all types of
                        criticism.</p>
                    <p>The conversation having reached this point, I said that there were other
                        subjects which I still wanted to discuss but which were not of immediate or
                        urgent concern, but the hour was growing late and that it might be well to
                        “call this a day”. Dr. Soong said that there were also other matters about
                        which he would like to talk and that we must get together again soon and
                        continue therewith.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                  <hi rend="italic">Addendum:</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>In the course of the conversation Dr. Soong made a number of observations
                        indicative of gratification on his part over progress that is being made in
                        supplying airplanes to China and over the improvement in the situation as
                        regards China’s defense. He said that the airfields in Assam are rapidly
                        being improved; that planes are now being supplied to the Chinese air force
                        and General Chennault; that China’s defensive position is, thanks to these
                        developments, now secure.</p>
                    <p>I took occasion to inform Dr. Soong of our views and effort in regard to the
                        question of allocating five additional planes to CNAC;<note n="21" xml:id="d81fn21">China National Aviation Corporation; for further
                            correspondence on this subject, see <ref target="#pg_661">pp. 661</ref>
                            ff.</note> and I asked whether Dr. Soong would wish to offer any comment
                        regarding the desirability of our persevering in or desisting from effort in
                        that connection. Dr. Soong replied that he felt that CNAC had a <pb n="100" xml:id="pg_100" facs="0110"/>real need for those planes; that
                        acquisition of those planes by CNAC would be helpful from every point of
                        view; that the Chinese greatly appreciate the service which CNAC has
                        rendered and is rendering. He expressly mentioned their appreciation of Mr.
                        Bond and of his spirit of cooperativeness. He said that “CNAC should by all
                        means have these planes if it is at all possible”. I asked whether, in the
                        event of the allocation being affected, there would be any assurance that
                        Chinese authorities might not transfer these planes away from CNAC. Dr.
                        Soong replied that he thought there need be no apprehension on that point;
                        that the Chinese authorities wanted CNAC to have additional planes; and that
                        if any trouble should by chance arise, he would be willing to intervene on
                        CNAC’s behalf. He then expressed emphatically an appreciation of General
                        Chennault, Chennault’s services, and the effective cooperation which
                        prevails between Chennault and Chinese authorities.</p>

                    <p>1152. Following are paraphrased excerpts of an article by Rodney Gilbert
                        which appeared in the August 16 issue of the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Herald Tribune:</hi> Baldwin has made himself a sounding board for all
                        the idle gossip about Chinese military ineptitude that have filtered into
                        Washington. If the drives into unoccupied China from which the Japanese come
                        tumbling back with great loss of life and equipment are simply
                        “reconnaissance forays” a map of the present position in China will show
                        that they suffer great inconveniences and dangers, a situation which Gilbert
                        defies the strategists to explain. From free choice, according to the absurd
                        theory represented in Baldwin’s article, the Japanese do without rich
                        sources of materials such as tungsten, tin, antimony, et cetera, which one
                        would suppose that their war industries would be glad to have. According to
                        this “poisonous nonsense” the Japanese have been in control of the termini
                        of 3 trunk railroads for 5 years but have been content to let the Chinese
                        remain in possession of the middle sections. Listing the widespread areas of
                        unoccupied China such as Yunnan, sections of eastern and central China,
                        Hunan, et cetera, occupation of which might reasonably be expected to profit
                        and strengthen Japan, Gilbert points out that nothing stands in the way of
                        such occupation but Chinese soldiery, in encounters with which the Japanese
                        have had some of their “invaluable training”. He makes it clear that, while
                        Chinese resistance may not be of a character to appeal to some types of
                        western military mind, it has nevertheless been an effective embarrassment
                        and barrier to Japan, is now, and will be in the future if supplies can be
                        brought into China.</p>

                        of despatch no. 116, August 11, 1943,<note n="24" xml:id="d85fn24">Not
                            printed.</note> from the Embassy officer at Chengtu, on the subject of
                        the skill of Chinese aircraft repair crews.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Smith reports that, according to two American technical representatives
                        with the U. S. Army who recently visited Chengtu, Chinese aircraft repair
                        crews display considerable mechanical skill and have benefitted greatly from
                        the basic mechanical training given them by Russian advisers during the past
                        five years. The American experts consider that these crews are capable of
                        servicing American aircraft and are convinced that the development of civil
                        aviation in China after the war will not be handicapped by the lack of

                        over the city but apparently dropped bombs only in the outskirts near a

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The article written by
                        Hanson Baldwin entitled “Too Much Wishful Thinking About China” which
                        appeared in the August issue of the <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi>
                        has no doubt been brought to your attention and you have probably heard
                        something of the reaction to this highly critical—uncomplimentary—discussion
                        of China’s past and present military effort and military potential.</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="pg_103" facs="0113"/>
                    <p>In a signed article in the August 16 issue of the <hi rend="italic">New York
                            Herald Tribune</hi> Mr. Rodney Gilbert, “an old China hand” and by no
                        means a sentimentalist about China (he is the author of <hi rend="italic">What’s Wrong with China?</hi>), takes issue with the “absurd theory”
                        for which Mr. Baldwin makes himself the spokesman, and the <hi rend="italic">Herald Tribune</hi> editorially supports Mr. Gilbert.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gilbert states that the source of the military gossip about China as
                        reflected in Mr. Baldwin’s article is Washington, “Where desk men of high
                        rank in the various offices of the fighting forces meet all the boys who
                        come back from the Far East and piece together from their lightly told
                        anecdotes of hit or miss Chinese ways, a pattern of hopeless inefficiency,
                        graft, misleading Chinese propaganda, and fumbling of opportunities.” Mr.
                        Gilbert states that Mr. Baldwin, who has never been in China, has made
                        himself “a sounding board for all the idle gossip about Chinese military
                        ineptitude that has filtered into Washington.…”<note n="25" xml:id="d87fn25">Omissions in this document indicated in the original.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>The reaction in China to Mr. Baldwin’s article has been most unfortunate. The
                        Chinese—and I think rightly—have deeply resented Mr. Baldwin’s unreserved,
                        unsympathetic and in many respects, unsound analysis of the Chinese military
                        position. The <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>, most influential paper in
                        China, states “… we cannot but feel indignant because his (Baldwin’s) words
                        have not only caused him loss of prestige as a commentator but also have
                        insulted China and her people … When her (China’s) independence is
                        interfered with … she fights to protect her independence and freedom and
                        fight to the last she must.” The <hi rend="italic">Hsin Hua Jih Pao</hi>
                        (Communist Party daily newspaper published in Chungking) terms Mr. Baldwin’s
                        statement that “China is not a nation in our sense of the word but a
                        geographer’s expression” not only criticism but purposeful slander
                        disclosing his own ignorance.</p>
                    <p>Our Embassy at Chungking has informed the Department that Mr. Baldwin’s
                        article has caused resentment in China that is deep and bitter and
                        wide-spread. The Embassy states that the article has been the subject of
                        discussion at a special meeting of Cabinet ministers and party leaders and
                        of a conference held by Generalissimo and Madame Chiang with various high
                        Chinese officials. The Embassy expresses the opinion that continued public
                        criticism of China may have an adverse effect on our relations with the
                        Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>My purpose in writing to you about this matter is not to take issue with Mr.
                        Baldwin or to go into the subject of what is fact and what is not fact with
                        regard to Chinese military performance and Chinese military potential. I
                        wish rather to bring to your attention—if you <pb n="104" xml:id="pg_104" facs="0114"/>have not already noticed it—the suggestion made by Mr.
                        Gilbert that military men in Washington are the source and inspiration of
                        Mr. Baldwin’s statements and theories regarding these subjects, for which
                        suggestion it is believed, both from external and from internal evidence,
                        that there may be some basis of fact. I venture to believe that, in the
                        interest of our relations with China, both political and military, as a
                        friend and ally, you would wish to consider the implications of Mr.
                        Gilbert’s suggestion and, whether it is or is not warranted by developments
                        in the past, to take appropriate steps toward insuring against its being
                        warranted as regards the future.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>(It will be recalled that Sheahan in 1939 and 1940 headed an American
                        commission which at the invitation of the Chinese Government toured China
                        and made recommendations for the improvement of the Chinese transportation
                        system. Since then he has been with General Stilwell’s command, working on
                        transportation problems. He is understood to be a very capable officer whose
                        opinions are of great value.)</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan called in response to an invitation. The
                        opportunity was taken to obtain information from him on a number of aspects
                        of China’s transportation problems and related questions. His observations
                        and views may be summarized as follows:</p>
                    <p>The practicable steps which it is vitally necessary to take to rebuild
                        China’s broken-down transportation system continue to be those which
                        Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan recommended in 1939. Road maintenance and
                        improvement, and the rehabilitation of native means of transport (river
                        junks, human carriers, et cetera), which can handle a very large volume of
                        traffic, are especially important; and a more centralized control should be
                        established to reduce graft and promote efficiency. Other necessary steps
                        include the acquisition of more substantial trucks, and the repair of some
                        10,000 immobilized broken-down trucks (for which, Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan
                        believes, there are fairly adequate supplies of spare parts already
                        available in India and China).</p>
                    <pb n="105" xml:id="pg_105" facs="0115"/>
                    <p>The establishment of an American transportation advisory office at Chungking
                        would help a great deal in forwarding the work of rehabilitating China’s
                        transportation system provided that the Chinese would prove cooperative.
                        Chinese have in fact intimated to Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan that his
                        services as an adviser are desired, but his military duties would prevent
                        his accepting such a position.</p>
                    <p>In any case it is most important to encourage the Chinese themselves to do
                        everything possible to solve their transportation problems—and especially to
                        repair and improve the road system in the region between Kunming and
                        Japanese-occupied areas on which future military operations will probably
                        depend to a large extent. Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan has the impression that
                        the Ministry of Communications under Tseng Yang-fu is taking a step in the
                        right direction by establishing a more centralized control over
                        transportation. The Chinese, considering their handicaps, have not done so
                        badly in the maintenance of transportation equipment. The heavy mortality of
                        trucks has been due less to the inefficiency of Chinese mechanics than to
                        the cheap construction of the trucks resulting from the fact that the
                        Government, instead of purchasing finished American vehicles, purchased only
                        skeleton chassis and completed the trucks with inferior Chinese technique
                        and materials.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan estimates that, following the recapture of the
                        Burma Road, it will take about three months to prepare the China section of
                        the road for operation. Restoration of traffic on the Burma section will be
                        more difficult in view of the greater destruction suffered by the railway
                        and road in that area, but with the reconquest of northern Burma it will be
                        possible to establish a direct route from Calcutta to the western end of the
                        Chinese section which can be used in lieu of the route from Rangoon.
                        Considerable use can be made of river transportation on the Brahmaputra. It
                        is planned to put through a pipe line from Burma to Kunming, which will
                        carry aviation gasoline. In the opinion of Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan, the
                        psychological effects of the reopening of the Burma Road will benefit China
                        more than the road’s actual transportation value.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the report that British experts are undertaking maintenance
                        work on the Iran–U. S. S. R.–Sinkiang route, Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan
                        feels that it would be preferable for Americans to handle this work,
                        especially in view of the strong anti-British sentiment in the Iran area.
                        The present volume of traffic over the Russian route is about 2,000 tons a
                        month and it is hoped that this figure can be doubled. The possibilities of
                        the Tibetan route are extremely limited.</p>
                    <p>In response to an inquiry as to the possibility of getting relief supplies
                        into China, Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan said that, in view of <pb n="106" xml:id="pg_106" facs="0116"/>the transportation bottleneck and of the
                        necessity of according priority to military supplies, he feared that the
                        delivery of relief supplies, despite its unquestionable urgency, would have
                        to be deferred for a long period.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan, while heading his commission for the study of
                        China’s transportation system in 1939 and 1940, experienced considerable
                        difficulties as a result of the friction between the groups headed by Dr. H.
                        H. Kung and Mr. T. V. Soong with which he had to deal, and he believes that
                        any American who might be appointed as a transportation adviser will have to
                        be very careful to avoid becoming involved in differences between these two
                        groups.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel Sheahan feels that relations between the Americans and the
                        British in India have tended to improve somewhat. There has been a tendency
                        on the part of some Americans to deal directly with the Indians rather than
                        through the British. On the whole the British have been surprisingly
                        tolerant of this practice.</p>

                    <p>A–40. Embassy’s 1444, August 13, 11 a.m. Hanson Baldwin’s article in the
                        August <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi> continues to be a subject of
                        lively discussion in Chinese circles and of angry comment in the controlled
                        Chinese press.</p>
                    <p>As an example of the reaction among the more liberal circles, it is reliably
                        reported that Dr. Sun Fo recently made a speech at a Legislative Yuan
                        meeting in which he criticized the Chinese Government’s present lack of
                        guiding aims and principles and cited in support of his criticism Pearl
                        Buck’s article in <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, Bisson’s article and the two
                        Baldwin articles; Sun Fo pointed out that as Mrs. Buck is well known as a
                        staunch friend of China her criticism cannot be deemed unfriendly and that
                        as she knows China well she cannot be dismissed as uninformed. According to
                        one informant, the articles have to some extent strengthened the hands of
                        the liberals within the Chinese Government by reinforcing their criticism of
                        Fascist trends and of the resultant lowering of morale within the
                        administration.</p>
                    <p>I have had some informal discussion of the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi>
                        article, and also of the other articles, with a number of Chinese officials,
                        at my own initiative on occasions which seemed appropriate and sometimes on
                        their initiative. Among these officials were Dr. Kung, Sun Fo, K. C. Wu
                        (Acting Foreign Minister) and Wang Shih-chieh (Secretary <pb n="107" xml:id="pg_107" facs="0117"/>General of the Central Planning Board and
                        former Minister of Information and Minister of Education). In reply to
                        inquiries as to the cause of this “wave of criticism” in the United States,
                        I have suggested, when it seemed likely that frankness would be appreciated,
                        that any out-of-focus statements in the articles might be in part a result
                        of a censorship which prevented comprehensive and accurate information
                        regarding the situation in China from reaching the United States and other
                        countries abroad. It is my impression that the officials with whom I talked
                        have for the most part been inclined to find some validity in this point of
                        view but there has so far come to our attention only one instance of any
                        real relaxation of censorship. On August 16 or 17, the <hi rend="italic">New
                            York Times</hi> and the United Press correspondents were permitted to
                        telegraph despatches in regard to the Kuomintang-Communist situation—the
                        first despatches on that subject permitted release except for one reportedly
                        very biased in favor of the Kuomintang which was written by the Chinese
                        correspondent of Reuter’s by special permission and possibly by direction
                        (Embassy’s despatch no. 1415, August 2, paragraph 2). The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> correspondent showed me his despatch as censored
                        and while references to both the justified and unjustified complaints of the
                        Communists against the administration were among the items deleted, the
                        article on the whole gave a fairly good background picture of the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Nothing, however, has occurred to alter our view that criticism in the
                        American press of China, whether or not justified, cannot help but have
                        adverse effects upon our relations until and unless the reactionary Chinese
                        leaders acquire something of an objective point of view as to the realities
                        of the world situation and the part that China is playing, or should play,
                        therein. Indeed, in their present state of extreme sensitiveness, and with
                        their deeply ingrained slavishness to considerations of face, the more
                        justifiable the criticism may be the more likely is resentment to be
                        increased.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                        telegrams no. 1233, July 20, 11 a.m. and no. 1221, July 19, 9 a.m., in
                        regard to the use of puppet troops in the fighting during May and June in
                        the Ichang and the Tungting Lake regions, and to enclose an excerpt from a
                        recent report by the Military Attaché (no. 375, August 24, 1943) on the
                        subject of the strength and disposition of puppet troops in China.<note n="28" xml:id="d92fn28">Enclosure not printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Contained in the excerpt is a discussion of the use of puppet troops in north
                        China, in central China and in south China. According to the Military
                        Attaché, while the main duties of puppet troops in north and central China
                        are those of garrison and police activity, there have been reports of
                        fighting between puppets and units of the Chinese New <pb n="109" xml:id="pg_109" facs="0119"/>Fourth Army (Communist), especially in
                        Shansi and eastern Hopei, and, as previously reported, puppet troops were
                        employed in the May and June fighting. In south China, the Military Attaché
                        states, another group of puppets has come into existence, following the
                        Japanese occupation of Kwangchow-wan; these troops are used for defense
                        purposes to secure the coast of Kwangtung for the protection of Japanese
                        shipping. He states that in the May and June operations in the Tungting Lake
                        region about two-thirds of the Japanese contingents were Manchurian or
                        Korean puppets, although all officers and all machine-gunners were
                        Japanese.</p>
                    <p>As regards the strength of the puppet troops, the Military Attaché states
                        that no accurate figures are available but that a rough estimate would be
                        about 100,000 for north China, 500,000 for Wang Ching-wei, and some 3,000
                        for south China, making a total of 603,000.</p>
                    <p>The Military Attaché points out that accurate information in regard to puppet
                        troops, their designations, strengths, commanders, et cetera, is very
                        difficult to obtain; that Chinese Intelligence agencies are reluctant to
                        report on these units; and that Japanese reports monitored from radio
                        broadcasts are colored for obvious propaganda purposes. He adds that it is,
                        however, significant that Chinese Intelligence reports of late contain more
                        information in regard to the activity of puppet troops—an indication that
                        their use is assuming greater importance and that the reorganization of
                        puppet units by the Japanese is beginning to bear fruit.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Foreign Minister called at his request. I proceeded first to
                        felicitate him on the splendid situation which developed at Quebec in
                        relation to more recognition and more attention to the Far East in the war,
                        including a plan to reopen the Burma Road. I said my felicitations go to
                        him, the Generalissimo and Madam Chiang Kaishek, who have labored so
                        valiantly. Dr. Soong said that he planned to return home about the 20th of
                        this month and that he would be pleased if I would bring him up to date on
                        all matters relating to the war situation of interest to China and also any
                        documents relating to the post-war situation. I replied that I would be only
                        too glad to do so.</p>
                    <p>I then proceeded to give Dr. Soong the substance of our draft of a proposed
                        Four Power interim or transition agreement. I need <pb n="110" xml:id="pg_110" facs="0120"/>not repeat this analysis here. I said that
                        very soon when some of its details were perfected and the matter was passed
                        on by the President I would undertake to get a very confidential copy to
                            him.<note n="29" xml:id="d93fn29">For text of copy handed on September
                            21 to Dr. Soong by the Adviser on Political Relations (Hornbeck), see

                        need for secrecy. He expressed his special gratification. He was also
                        thankful to the State Department for the attention some of us have given to
                        Chinese affairs and to the special requests of the Foreign Minister, during
                        recent weeks in particular.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then referred to his conversation with Mr. Lauchlin Currie some
                        weeks ago about the 40,000 tons of munitions promised China by Canada and
                        later revoked by Canada at the request of Mr. Currie. Dr. Soong thanked me
                        for mentioning this to the President at Quebec and said that he followed
                        this up with a talk with the President which was satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then brought up two requests of his Government heretofore made,
                        one, for China to be represented on the Combined General Staff with her
                        member located here in Washington, and also the standing request of China to
                        become a member of the Munitions Commission. At his request I said I would
                        be glad to mention them to the President and Mr. Churchill this week if I am
                        given a chance. He was very appreciative in each instance.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: 1. Referring to the next to the last
                        paragraph of your memorandum of conversation with Dr. Soong of September
                        2:</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hiss<note n="30" xml:id="d94fn30">Alger Hiss, Assistant to Mr.
                            Hornbeck.</note> and I have been looking into the question of the
                        Canadian promise to send munitions to China. We find that the question of
                        that promise was quickly gotten into the hands of the Joint War Aid
                        Committee—U.S.–Canada—as Dr. Soong might well have and probably did know
                        that it would—and that that Committee has been considering the whole
                        question from point of view of coordination, available transportation,
                        timing, etc. This Department is now represented on that Committee by Mr.
                            Hickerson<note n="31" xml:id="d94fn31">John D. Hickerson, Assistant
                            Chief of the Division of European Affairs.</note> but this
                        representation has been achieved only very recently. The Committee has
                        already approved release of something over 7,000 tons of the munitions in
                        question, and expects to release further amounts when and as release <pb n="111" xml:id="pg_111" facs="0121"/>seems practicable. There is an
                        all-influencing difference of opinion between Dr. Soong on the one hand and
                        the American and Canadian officials who have the say so on the other hand
                        regarding the question of transportation between Assam and China and the
                        question of size, safeguarding and liquidation of stock piles in Assam. In
                        that connection, Dr. Soong seems perhaps overly sanguine and the Canadian
                        and American officials who have the say so seem perhaps unduly conservative.
                        Pressure by the President upon the latter might perhaps cause them to see
                        the possibilities in a somewhat less conservative light. Also, recent
                        reports indicate that the existing stock piles in Assam, for the
                        safeguarding of which the U. S. Army is responsible, are deteriorating from
                        obvious neglect. A few words on that subject by the President might help
                        toward improving that situation.</p>
                    <p>2. With regard to the last paragraph of your same memorandum:</p>
                    <p>It may with ample warrant be doubted whether the time has yet come when it
                        would be practicable for the British and U. S. General Staffs to accord to
                        China a place on the Combined General Staff. It would seem, however, that
                        the time has come when China’s standing request for representation on the
                        Combined Munitions Board might to advantage be given favorable
                        consideration. There are, of course, substantial reasons which can be
                        advanced for keeping the Combined Munitions Board an exclusively American
                        and British organization; but, on the other hand, from a political point of
                        view and from point of view of facilitating administration and of applying
                        in practice the principle of cooperation in the military effort, there are
                        weighty considerations pro giving the Chinese a membership representation on
                        that board. This question should have the President’s consideration in his
                        capacity as Commander-in-Chief and his capacity as ultimate arbiter of
                        questions of foreign relations.</p>

                    <p>1649. Recent Allied victories have had a noticeably good effect on morale of
                        the Chinese oligarchy of officials, bankers <hi rend="italic">et al</hi>.
                        The scenes of victory are however too distant to inspire Chinese Government
                        and people to bestir themselves to increase China’s war effort which
                        remains, as it has for so long, negative in the sense that resistance is
                        negative as compared to offensive action. The Chinese continue to wait for
                        the Allies (chiefly the United States) to defeat Japan.</p>
                    <pb n="112" xml:id="pg_112" facs="0122"/>
                    <p>First hope of an early turn of fortune for China seems for most Chinese
                        leaders to lie in recapture of Burma and restoration of effective land and
                        sea communication with outside world. There are, on the other hand, a few
                        officials who fear an Allied attack upon Burma because it might impel the
                        Japs to muster and expend sufficient effort to envelop Kunming and in due
                        course make Chungking untenable. This apprehension is corollary to the fear
                        of some provincial and other generals to risk their armies lest the basis of
                        their personal position and influence in the oligarchy be dissipated.</p>
                    <p>Apprehensions in regard to a “Burma campaign” (as object of open, wide and
                        lively discussion in Chinese official and other circles) are also related to
                        deep suspicion (of which in some aspects we have reported before) that at
                        least one of China’s Allies has no heart for such a project and will if
                        campaign should be undertaken fail again to make an all-out or even
                        creditable effort.</p>
                    <p>The summing up of determinative Chinese feeling is, we believe, that failure
                        would be a body blow from which Chinese morale and Allied prestige and
                        influence in this theatre could recover only by immediate American action
                        such as a direct effective attack upon Japan proper or capture of China
                        coastal bases for such attack which would entail greater effort and cost
                        than would be required in the first place to make a “Burma campaign”
                        successful.</p>

                    <p>1671. It is widely reported that the notorious Tai Li, head of the
                        Generalissimo’s principal secret political and military police and
                        intelligence organization, has been relieved of his post as a result (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of the accumulative effect of arbitrary
                        kidnappings, executions, et cetera, of agents and employees of highly placed
                        persons, including the execution in the autumn of 1942 of Ling Hsu Liang,
                        head of the Transportation Department of the Central Trust, who instead of
                        using his trucks to evacuate Government supplies from Burma to China
                        allegedly employed them to bring in “luxury” goods for highly placed
                        persons; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of conflict with the corrupt interests
                        of highly placed persons arising from the organization’s corrupt “smuggling
                        prevention” activities; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of bitter rivalry
                        engendered in the Kuomintang’s secret police whose main function is the
                        overlapping field of “dangerous thoughts”; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) of the
                        reported breakdown of Tai Li’s intelligence organization in occupied China
                        due to successful Japanese <pb n="113" xml:id="pg_113" facs="0123"/>counter-espionage; and (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) of the criticism of Tai
                        Li and his Gestapo which Mme. Chiang heard in the United States and her
                        impression gained there that Americans believed that Tai Li rather than the
                            Gissimo<note n="31a" xml:id="d96fn32">Generalissimo Chiang
                            Kai-shek.</note> actually controlled China through his ruthless
                        utilization of Nazi and Japanese political police methods.</p>
                    <p>According to a personal friend of Tai Li, the latter has not been dismissed
                        but has been ordered henceforth to restrict himself to the more legitimate
                        phases of the organization’s activities—military and political intelligence
                        in the occupied areas and counter-espionage—and that his former political
                        police activities will hereafter be directed by Mao Chin Hsiang,
                        brother-in-law of the Gissimo by his first marriage.</p>

                    <p>… Tai Li boasts that he has agents even in Japan and it is not unlikely that
                        he maintains a considerable organization in the United States as probably
                        the Kuomintang Secret Service does also.</p>

                    <p>(By way of passing comment: The British Embassy’s memorandum enclosed with
                        the Department’s instruction seems in general to reflect the <hi rend="italic">laissez faire</hi> attitude which characterizes certain
                        aspects of British policy toward China.)</p>
                    <p>As indicated in our despatch no. 1529, we concur, with important
                        qualifications, in the statement in the British memorandum that the
                        temporary maintenance of the present situation in China seems to depend
                        greatly on crop prospects. This statement is qualified by the British
                        Embassy with one proviso—that the weight of Japanese attacks upon the
                        Chinese is not substantially increased. We would add <pb n="114" xml:id="pg_114" facs="0124"/>a number of other equally or more important
                        provisos. We would say providing also (1) that Allied victories and
                        especially American victories in the Pacific continue; (2) that continuing
                        and increasing air support is supplied the China theatre and becomes an
                        increasingly effective striking force against the Japanese; (3) that
                        endeavor to recapture Burma is not delayed too long, i. e., until for
                        example next summer; (4) that an early campaign to recapture Burma is
                        successfully carried through; and (5) that victory over Japan is brought
                        much nearer in point of time before the present deterioration in China
                        (economic, military, political and administrative) is allowed to continue
                        for a protracted period (say, no longer than one more year).</p>
                    <p>As indicated in despatch no. 1529, the circumstance that the vast majority of
                        the population of free China is agricultural precludes the probability,
                        despite the fantastic inflation rate, that a general economic collapse will
                        occur in the same time ratio as that of the collapse in Austria in the years
                        1921–23 after a parallel (in terms of currency expansion) seven year period
                        of inflation.</p>
                    <p>But the economic deterioration cannot be permitted to progress along its
                        present course indefinitely without risk of the most serious
                        consequences.</p>
                    <p>We have reported from time to time in regard to the military deterioration
                        which continues without sign of abatement; we have reported in regard not
                        only to the worsening of morale of Chinese troops due to malnutrition and to
                        inactivity but also in regard to the consequent development on some borders
                        between free China and Japanese dominated areas of a virtual truce under
                        which Chinese military and others engage in extensive smuggling and trade
                        (with strategic materials and essential commodities going to the Japanese
                        and currency and so-called luxury goods coming into free China) and pursue
                        other gainful activities for purposes of subsistence and profit. We
                        mentioned in our telegram no. 803, May 28 that the tendency on the part of
                        the military as well as other Chinese to make the best of the realities of
                        the situation was apparent in the growing trade and smuggling between
                        unoccupied and occupied China and we suggested that if this tendency should
                        remain unchecked there was a strong possibility of the further extension of
                        the already extensive (if unstable) armed truce in various sections between
                        the two areas, with the Japanese and their puppets peacefully consolidating
                        their positions as they have in Manchuria, and with free China becoming more
                        and more economically dependent upon the other area.</p>
                    <p>We have also reported at length in regard to the political and administrative
                        deterioration. We have described the increasing tendencies of the Government
                        to utilize repressive fascist practices and the breaking of morale of lower
                        bracket officials because their positions <pb n="115" xml:id="pg_115" facs="0125"/>no longer provide them an honest livelihood and even the
                        desertion of minor officials to the puppets for that reason. We have
                        reported also the expansion of purely civilian trade between occupied and
                        unoccupied areas and the seemingly growing intercourse by civilian travelers
                        between the two areas for commercial and sometimes for political purposes.
                        The British Embassy mentions that there has always been some contact between
                        the Chungking Government and the Nanking regime and that this is being
                        maintained; we have reason to believe that it is increasing in the sense
                        that contact between individual officials of the two regimes is
                        increasing.</p>
                    <p>The question of what remedial measures might improve the situation does not
                        appear to have been considered in the British Embassy memorandum. It seems
                        to us that this question largely resolves itself into military problems. As
                        current American victories in the Pacific (and Allied victories in Europe)
                        tend to sustain (or retard the deterioration of) confidence and morale,
                        acceleration of American victories in the Pacific would have increased
                        beneficial effects upon Chinese morale, and therefore upon Chinese economy
                        and finance. Early recapture of Burma would without question exert, by
                        resultant restoration of confidence, a highly beneficial effect upon China’s
                        economy and finance. On the other hand, an attempt to recapture Burma ending
                        in failure would be in the nature of a disaster of the first magnitude
                        (Embassy’s telegram no. 1649, September 7, 1943). Capture of Formosa or of
                        ports and bases on the China coast from which to launch direct attack on
                        Japan would have an effect perhaps even greater than would recapture of
                        Burma. (The magnitude of the task of effecting such remedies is indication
                        of the drastic nature of China’s needs.)</p>
                    <p>It is our considered opinion, in the light of the various inter-related
                        aspects of the situation, that the most potent factors—actually the
                        determining factors—are and will continue to be those comprised in military
                        developments within China and in areas adjoining China.</p>

                    <p>1674. 1. General Hearn, in the absence of Stilwell, came to see me last
                        evening. He said Stilwell and he were much concerned over situation here in
                        respect to military matters. The current CEC<note n="35" xml:id="d98fn35">Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.</note>
                        <pb n="116" xml:id="pg_116" facs="0126"/>session was apparently failing,
                        through lack of interest, to give even lip service consideration to
                        prosecution of war in this theater (a circumstance which Embassy has so far
                        hopefully refrained from reporting) and the gathering here of military
                        leaders from all parts of French [<hi rend="italic">Free</hi>] China seemed
                        to be chiefly for the purpose of discussion of Kuomintang-Communist
                        differences (Embassy’s 1664, September 9<note n="36" xml:id="d98fn36">
                     <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_327">p.
                        327</ref>.</note>). He said that Chinese were doing practically nothing to
                        help military situation; even construction of absolutely essential airfields
                        and roads (such as the Kunming–Proshan road) was far behind because of lack
                        of push by Chinese Government, failure to allocate sufficient funds for the
                        work, failure to provide labor to do the work and failure to prevent
                        hoarding of construction materials and to keep prices down to a point where
                        such materials could be obtained.</p>
                    <p>Hearn said that the Generalissimo and other Chungking high military
                        authorities well knew how Stilwell and he feel about the whole picture but
                        apparently Chiang hesitated to attempt to launch effective military,
                        administrative, financial and other effort (including conscription of labor)
                        because he was not certain of adequate backing from below. Hearn asked if
                        there was any way in which I could help cause improvement in situation by
                        approaching civil officials of Government who might at this time be in
                        position to exert influence or by other means.</p>
                    <p>2. After some discussion I said I would be glad to make the effort and would
                        privately and informally approach officials (such as Kung, Wang
                            Chung-hui,<note n="37" xml:id="d98fn37">Secretary General of Chinese
                            Supreme National Defense Council.</note> Wu Teh-chen,<note n="38" xml:id="d98fn38">Secretary General of Kuomintang Central Executive
                            Committee.</note> Sun Fo) who might be willing and able to accomplish
                        something. I said that I could mention to them the apparent lack of interest
                        of CEC in vital problem of getting on with the war against Japan; that I
                        feared this would be noted abroad especially with the Burma campaign in
                        offing; that Lord Mountbatten was reportedly coming to China to survey the
                        situation and our military feared that he would receive a most unfavorable
                        impression of it; that our military felt that Yunnan Province was in a very
                        vulnerable position due to lack of adequate measures for defense or offense
                        including protected airfields and roads; that airfields and roads in
                        question were of vital importance to Chinese and American forces in
                        undertaking a campaign in Burma; that it was common belief among foreign
                        military observers that under present conditions the Japs if desirous of
                        making the effort and if willing to pay the cost could succeed in capturing
                        or cutting off Kunming; that with Kunming <pb n="117" xml:id="pg_117" facs="0127"/>isolated or in Jap hands, it would be impossible to fly
                        further supplies into China from India and Chungking could be readily
                        bombed; that I was accordingly approaching Chinese leaders quite frankly and
                        with unconcealed perturbation in earnest hope that they would exert
                        influence to rectify it. Hearn asked that I carry this suggestion into
                        effect and I am accordingly calling on Kung and others as soon as calls can
                        be arranged.</p>
                    <p>3. Another suggestion in which Hearn heartily concurs is that a message from
                        the President to Chiang might be very helpful as giving Chiang both armor
                        and ammunition with which to take necessary forthright action. (Although CEC
                        session is about to close the People’s Political Council is to meet within a
                        few days.) Such message (in comparatively mild form) might be to the effect
                        that on the occasion of the formal gathering of Chinese leading statesmen
                        and generals in whose hands rest the direction of China’s war effort in
                        partnership with the United States and other Allies, the President wishes to
                        assure the Generalissimo that in forthcoming joint military effort in this
                        theatre against Jap forces the United States (and Britain?) forces are not
                        fully prepared but are wholly determined to fight through, side by side with
                        Chinese until objective of reopening the land route to China is attained;
                        that in North Africa, Sicily and southern Italy it has been by supreme test
                        of all-out effort, wholehearted mutual assistance, unrestricted pooling of
                        resources and complete coordination of American and British forces acting as
                        one that success has been achieved; that the supreme test in offensive
                        against Japanese forces in Burma will be whether the Allies there can
                        similarly muster and weld together their resources and energies in a task
                        whose success is so vital to China and in general to advancing of Allied
                        march on Japan. (Hearn suggested the matter might also be brought to
                        attention of Mr. Churchill.)</p>
                    <p>4. It is reported by a reliable informed source but not confirmed that the
                        group in Government which has been advocating use of force against
                        Communists has succeeded in having the CEC agree to issuance of a manifesto
                        which is to be in nature of an ultimatum to the Communists.</p>
                    <p>5. As stated in our 1649, September 7, failure of an attempt to recapture
                        Burma would be a disaster to Chinese morale of first magnitude. I
                        recommended with all earnestness that something along the lines suggested in
                        paragraph 3 be taken without delay in conjunction with such efforts as we
                        may appropriately make here. In this connection I mention our recent reports
                        indicating the surprising influence and weight which American opinion and
                        criticism can have upon Chinese Government and leaders—surprising perhaps
                        because we may not heretofore have fully realized how acutely aware the
                        Chinese are <pb n="118" xml:id="pg_118" facs="0128"/>of the extent to which
                        they are and will continue to be dependent upon us.</p>

                        some of them showed concern and considerable interest and said they would
                        see if they could do anything to be helpful. Dr. Wang said that he would
                        have a thorough discussion with the Gmo.<note n="40" xml:id="d99fn40">Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</note> Dr. Wu has told me that he went

                        that of Dr. Kung from whom I gained the clear impression that the surrender
                        of Italy has confirmed the widespread Chinese feeling that there is no
                        longer need for China to put forth greater effort in the war and that China
                        can continue with increased complacence to sit back and wait for U. S. and
                        British to crush Japan. (The Gmo’s extraordinary optimism as to the early
                        termination of war and in regard to the economic situation as he is quoted
                        in Embassy’s 1692, September 12,<note n="41" xml:id="d99fn41">
                     <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_331">p. 331</ref>.</note>
                        is a reflection of this feeling.) Dr. Kung indicated that he considered the
                        question of a Burma campaign was now of comparatively minor importance and
                        that even the recapture of Burma would not, because of transport limitations
                        and difficulties, greatly affect China one way or other. He felt that the
                        surrender of Italy now made it possible for British and American fleets to
                        come very soon to Indian Ocean and he suggested that recapture of Singapore
                        and then occupation of Haiphong would be appropriate steps for Allies to
                        take looking to a nearly direct attack upon Japan. When I remarked that the
                        problems of defense and <pb n="119" xml:id="pg_119" facs="0129"/>of a Burma
                        campaign were immediate, he said that there was no reason why the naval
                        campaign he has suggested could not be undertaken and accomplished this
                        year.</p>
                    <p>I venture to suggest that if consideration is being given to recommending
                        that the President send General Chiang congratulations on his assumption of
                        the Presidency of China, this might provide springboard for a message such
                        as suggested in our 1674.</p>

                            concerned over the anti-Chinese feeling existing among American armed
                            forces in China, reports of which were received by Madame Chiang from
                            American sources during her recent visit to the United States. The only
                            solution to this problem contemplated by the Chinese authorities is the
                            assignment of interpreters to American troops and various forms of
                            entertainment. Most observers are of the opinion that this feeling is
                            unavoidable in view of the restriction of the soldiers’ contacts to
                            lower class Chinese and that little can be done to change this feeling.
                            A program of lectures by and discussions with Chinese university
                            professors is now being planned under the Army’s auspices. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>

                    <p>Father Meeus, who states that he is employed by the Ministry of Information
                        for propaganda work in the United States (through the Catholic publication
                        which he represents and through tours of the United States made by him at
                        the instance of the Ministry), asserts that General Chiang Kai-shek is
                        concerned over the anti-Chinese feeling among American armed forces in
                        China, evidence of which was given to Madame Chiang during her recent visit
                        to the United States in numerous letters to her quoting statements from
                        letters received by persons in the United States from American soldiers in
                        China. Writers of these letters to Madame Chiang, some of which were
                        unsigned, are said to have criticized statements made by her in speeches,
                        charging that her picture of a unified, democratic and patriotic China was
                        at variance with that given by American soldiers in China. The soldiers’
                        personal distaste for China and the Chinese was also reflected in the
                        letters. General Chiang has instructed Dr. Hollington Tong, Vice Minister of
                        Information, to take steps to correct this situation, but Dr. Tong
                        reportedly has recommended only the assignment of about 400 interpreters to
                        the American armed forces and the provision of entertainment by jugglers,
                        musicians and actors.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy feels that this situation gives added reason for the setting up
                        of a program of some kind for the purpose of combatting this widespread
                        anti-Chinese feeling among the American troops. While there is no certainty
                        that the program envisaged by Dr. J. K. Fairbank,<note n="43" xml:id="d101fn43">Representative at Chungking of the Interdepartmental
                            Committee for the Acquisition of Foreign Publications.</note> in
                        conjunction with the American Army authorities in China (Department’s
                        telegram No. 950, July 24, 2 p.m. and Embassy’s telegram No. 1425, August
                        11, 10 a.m.<note n="44" xml:id="d101fn44">Neither printed.</note>), will be
                        effective in changing this feeling, the program deserves serious
                        consideration in that as the war goes on there will probably be increased
                        numbers of American <pb n="121" xml:id="pg_121" facs="0131"/>soldiers in
                        this country. The feeling among the troops now stationed here will
                        inevitably have its effect on all those who may arrive in the future.</p>
                    <p>The American Army authorities are not unaware of this feeling, but they
                        apparently consider that it will be extremely difficult to eradicate such
                        feeling among American soldiers whose contact with and knowledge of the
                        Chinese scene is confined chiefly to servants, coolies and shopkeepers. One
                        American officer, who has had some experience with similar conditions in
                        India, states that the most effective means of changing this feeling will
                        come from actual combined military operations of the troops of the two
                        countries against the Japanese. A well known Chinese educator states that
                        this feeling is inevitable and that, while it is undesirable to have
                        American soldiers now in China return to the United States with an
                        unfavorable picture of this country, there seems to be no real solution to
                        the problem for the vast majority of the troops.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                        telegrams nos. 1674, September 11, and 1711, September 15, in regard to the
                        concern of Generals Stilwell and Hearn over certain aspects of the present
                        and pending military situation in this area.</p>
                    <p>There are now enclosed, for purposes of record, memoranda of
                            conversations<note n="46" xml:id="d102fn46">Four enclosures not
                            printed.</note> on this subject which I have had with Dr. K. C. Wu,
                        Acting Foreign Minister; General Wu Teh-chen, Secretary General of the
                        Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang; Dr. Wang Chung-hui, Secretary
                        General of the Supreme National Defense Council; Dr. Sun Fo, President of
                        the Legislative Yuan; and Dr. H. H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive
                        Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance. The general substance and tenor
                        of these conversations <pb n="122" xml:id="pg_122" facs="0132"/>were
                        reported and commented on in our telegram no. 1711, September 15 referred to
                        above.</p>
                    <p>It is too early to say whether the conversations have been definitively
                        productive to any degree as regards the particular problems to which they
                        were addressed. As mentioned in our 1711, September 15, the Chinese
                        officials with whom I talked received my remarks in most friendly fashion,
                        some showed interest and concern and some said that they would endeavor to
                        have appropriate action taken. But Dr. Kung, who holds the second highest
                        place in the Government, indicated that in his view the surrender of Italy
                        had relegated the problems presented to a comparatively minor place because
                        he believed that Allied naval forces in strength could now speedily be sent
                        to the Indian Ocean for recapture of Singapore and occupation of Haiphong as
                        preliminary steps toward direct attack upon Japan.</p>
                    <p>Prior to Italy’s surrender it was apparent that most leaders of the Chinese
                        Government were pinning their principal hopes for the immediate future upon
                        an early campaign to retake Burma. We feel that now Dr. Kung’s attitude
                        reflects that of President Chiang Kaishek and others who, in a manner not
                        uncharacteristic of a people as volatile as the Chinese, have been seeking
                        escape from their present seemingly insurmountable economic problems by
                        indulgence in an unjustifiable optimism for the future. We have reported the
                        surprising optimism as to an early termination of the war expressed by the
                        Generalissimo in his “instructions” to the recent plenary session of the
                        Central Executive Committee and the even more astonishing optimism he
                        expressed in regard to the unabated spiraling of inflation and the pressing
                        economic situation in general. We reported previously our considered
                        opinion, gained from observation and conversation with numbers of Government
                        officials, that the Chinese, weary from the heavy burdens and trials of the
                        past six years, have persuaded themselves that China has done its share and
                        psychologically have withdrawn into roseate dreams of a prosperous post-war
                        China while waiting for us and the British to accomplish the task of
                        defeating Japan and of bringing their post-war dreams into being.</p>
                    <p>In the final manifesto of the CEC session<note n="47" xml:id="d102fn47">See
                            telegram No. 1706, September 14, from the Chargé in China, <ref target="#pg_335">p. 335</ref>, and subsequent telegrams.</note>
                        issued on September 13, some emphasis was laid on the war of resistance
                        against Japan. In the light of the further evidence we have recently had of
                        the power of American criticism upon Chinese leaders, this last moment lip
                        service to a subject which had been almost completely ignored throughout the
                        session, is probably not unrelated to the conversations described in the
                        enclosed memoranda. But emphasis in the manifesto, such as it is, was only
                        on “resistance”; there was not even a platitudinous appeal for forthright or
                        offensive action.</p>
                    <pb n="123" xml:id="pg_123" facs="0133"/>
                    <p>We may, however, take encouragement from the very fact that American
                        criticism or fear of criticism exerts a far-reaching influence in Chinese
                        official circles and that we undoubtedly possess a powerful lever which can
                        sometimes be used to advantage. There is little question in our minds and in
                        the minds of other foreign observers here that, as we have indicated in our
                        reports, the recent changes in the organic law relating to the office of
                        President (although the apparent endeavor to set up the semblance of the
                        chief executive office of a Western democracy has merely confirmed Chiang
                        Kai-shek’s personal dictatorship), the CEC session’s apologetic announcement
                        for post-war constitutional government and the mildness of the session’s
                        pronouncement in regard to Kuomintang-Communist difficulties were all in
                        considerable part the result of efforts by China’s leaders to improve the
                        appearance to the United States of things as they were and to avoid ill
                        opinion in the United States.</p>
                    <p>We accordingly feel that the conversations have been in the right direction
                        and that as regards the Kuomintang-Communist difficulties they have been
                        definitely helpful especially as the CEC session opened with an influential
                        “war party” of die-hards crying for punitive action against the Communists.
                        But the conversations have not succeeded and probably will not succeed,
                        without substantial support from home, in influencing the Chinese Government
                        to set itself to work to increase by military action or other forthright
                        affirmative means China’s participation in the war against Japan.</p>

                        <p>I called on General Wu this afternoon by appointment, and went over the
                            situation with him closely along the lines of my remarks to Dr. Wang
                            Chung-hui (memorandum of September 11<note n="48" xml:id="d102fn48">Not
                                printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>General Wu said that he was very glad indeed that I had come to him and
                            he was sure that if the Generalissimo and General Ho Yingchin were
                            completely aware of the situation that effective orders to rectify it
                            would be issued at once. I said again that General Stilwell had of
                            course been in frequent conference with the Generalissimo and General Ho
                            and fully realized that both were very anxious to see that everything
                            possible was done to get matters forward but that our military had a
                            feeling that there were some strata of military officials and <pb n="124" xml:id="pg_124" facs="0134"/>others below the Generalissimo
                            and General Ho who were not taking sufficiently effective action
                            pursuant to their orders from above.</p>
                        <p>General Wu said that he would see what could be done and that he realized
                            fully that the matter was one of great importance to both China and the
                            United States. He said that as regards the apparent lack of interest of
                            the CEC in the war against Japan, the meetings here included the calling
                            together of the General Staff and the military situation in China was of
                            course a subject of discussion. As regards the Communist situation he
                            said that this was only one of a number of problems; that the Chinese
                            Government realized it was most unfortunate that it had to immobilize
                            “twenty divisions” including some of China’s best troops to guard its
                            rear against the Communists while at the same time facing the Japanese
                            and that, as I had mentioned, one result of this situation was that
                            neither those twenty divisions nor the Communists were actively fighting
                            the Japanese. He said that the CEC was, he thought, going to appeal to
                            the Communists to fulfil their promises of 1937 in the hope that this
                            situation could be improved; that no Government of course could permit
                            the existence within its borders of another and independent government
                            with an army such as the Communists maintained.<note n="49" xml:id="d102fn49">In his memorandum of conversation with Dr. Kung,
                                Mr. Atcheson stated that the latter also took “almost the same line
                                as that taken by General Wu Teh-chen” on this subject.</note> I made
                            it clear that our military had no complaint against Dr. Tseng Yang-fu
                            and fully appreciated Dr. Tseng’s energetic efforts.</p>
                        <p>After discussing various other phases of the situation in China and some
                            aspects of Sino-American relations, General Wu thanked me again and said
                            that we should talk together oftener, and I departed.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Embassy’s despatch No. 1564
                        of September 10, 1943, in regard to the situation in China, I have the honor
                        to enclose a copy of despatch No. 38 of August 24, 1943,<note n="52" xml:id="d105fn52">Not printed.</note> from the Consul at Kweilin<note n="53" xml:id="d105fn53">Arthur R. Ringwalt.</note> on the subject of
                        general conditions in this country.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ringwalt indicates in his despatch, which contains a brief summary, his
                        opinion that the situation in China is steadily growing worse and that the
                        deterioration will, if unchecked, make impossible any material contribution
                        from China to the war effort.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is inclined to agree in general outline with Mr. Ringwalt’s dark
                        picture of conditions in China but feels that he is perhaps unduly
                        pessimistic with regard to the implicit possibility of a serious crisis in
                        the near future. In any case, as it appears unlikely that the Government
                        will take effective action to ameliorate the political, <pb n="126" xml:id="pg_126" facs="0136"/>economic and military deterioration
                        described in both Mr. Ringwalt’s despatch and in the Embassy’s despatch
                        under reference, China’s contribution to the war effort can be expected to
                        remain merely a passive rather than an active one.</p>
                    <p>We would reaffirm our opinion that the maintenance of the situation in China
                        will continue to depend greatly both on the food supply and on military
                        considerations, especially military considerations in the Far Eastern
                        theater, and that accelerated Allied successes in the Southwest Pacific and
                        successful direct action in China and adjacent areas should best serve to
                        keep the deterioration from progressing to the point of disaster.<note n="54" xml:id="d105fn54">In a memorandum dated November 9, Troy L.
                            Perkins of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs made the following
                            comment on one aspect of the military situation in China, as described
                            by the Consul at Kweilin: “One item, if true, is startling: ‘It is
                            reliably stated that at the time of the invasion of Chekiang and Kiangsi
                            in 1942 [Japanese destruction of possible air bases], the troops under
                            General Ku Chu-t’ung numbered only 25 percent of their nominal strength,
                            and they were only coolies engaged in transportation of
                            contraband’.”</note>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: Your letter of August 26th,
                        calling attention to the article by Mr. Hanson W. Baldwin in the August
                        issue of the <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi> entitled “Too Much
                        Wishful Thinking About China,” and to comments by Mr. Rodney Gilbert which
                        this article inspired in the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald Tribune</hi>
                        on August 16th, has had my close study.</p>
                    <p>You will appreciate my grave concern at the closing paragraph of your letter
                        in which you express your own belief “that there may be some basis of fact”
                        in Mr. Gilbert’s assertion that Mr. Baldwin’s derogatory opinion of China as
                        an effective military force was inspired by high-ranking officers in
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>I am unwilling to believe that high-ranking officers have made such
                        statements to Mr. Baldwin, but I shall immediately investigate the matter in
                        order that I may be certain that if such errors have been made in the past
                        they shall in no event continue in the future, and that there shall be no
                        such further cause for embarrassment to this country’s relations with
                        China.</p>
                    <p>I can readily understand the distress which Mr. Baldwin’s opinions should
                        have caused in Chungking. But I am confident that such resentment as is held
                        will be directed toward Mr. Baldwin and not <pb n="127" xml:id="pg_127" facs="0137"/>against the War Department, whose policy of mutual respect
                        and cooperation is too well known to responsible Chinese leaders to be
                        placed in jeopardy by the statement, however disturbing, of a single
                        commentator.</p>

                    <p>With reference to Chungking’s despatch no. 1254 of June 12, 1943, special
                        attention is invited to the final paragraph in which the statement is made
                        that General Hsiung Shih-hui, recently head of the Chinese Military Mission
                        to the United States, returned to China with a strong anti-American
                        attitude, according to reports, and with an inclination to align himself
                        with members of the so-called “Peace Party” which favors making an endeavor
                        at some appropriate time to come to terms with the Japanese.</p>
                    <p>General Hsiung’s period of assignment in Washington was not a happy one or
                        one which benefited Chinese-American relations. This was due in large part
                        to the treatment which General Hsiung received in this country. The military
                        services treated him with scant courtesy and consideration and his general
                        reception in Washington left much to be desired.</p>
                    <p>The character and background of General Hsiung may explain but not excuse the
                        treatment he received. He did not speak English. He was not in the strict
                        sense a military man. He was what is described in China as a “political
                        general”. For many years prior to his coming to Washington he was Chairman
                        of the Kiangsi Provincial Government. He is an ultra-conservative Kuomintang
                        official.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, he came as the special emissary of General Chiang Kai-shek. He
                        is one of Chiang Kai-shek’s most intimate and trusted officials. It is
                        therefore much to be regretted that he was permitted, because of the
                        treatment he received here, to return to China with what he no doubt feels
                        are justifiable causes for complaint and with an unsympathetic attitude
                        toward the United States.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to observe that General Hsiung, probably one of the most
                        representative officials that the Kuomintang Government could have sent to
                        Washington, failed in his mission. This thought raises the question whether
                        envoys who are most representative of the governments which send them abroad
                        actually are able best to represent those governments.</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="pg_128" facs="0138"/>
                    <p>With regard to the statement in the reference despatch that General Hsiung
                        was to be appointed Secretary General of the National Planning Board, you
                        will recall that this appointment of General Hsiung was gazetted a month or
                        so ago. It is considered unfortunate that a man of General Hsiung’s
                        character should have been appointed to this important position which may
                        have a very large influence in shaping China’s post-war plans, development
                        and policies. From the American point of view it is particularly unfortunate
                        if, as reported, he has returned to China with an anti-American bias.</p>

                        through the Chinese censorship. The picture which he paints is a very
                        “black” one indeed, although there is little of substance that is new. His

                                “One of the worst rackets in China has been the cornering of medical
                                supplies.” Among the Chinese forces on the Yellow River front losses
                                through disease and malnutrition are reported to be 25 percent a

               </p>
                    <p>Mr. Johnson submits this report to the Department because it is “interesting
                        not only as a commentary by an independent newspaperman, but also as
                        throwing some light upon the kind of background material that is influencing
                        to a very large extent the outlook of Australians and the British generally
                        on the situation in the Far East.”</p>
                    <p>Although regarding the newspaperman’s report as “an unbalanced story,” Mr.
                        Johnson does not attempt to deny the truth of the facts presented. Instead
                        he states: “I think that all of the information contained in this letter is
                        well known at home. Certainly there is very little of it that is new to me.”
                        However, Mr. Johnson’s interpretation places these facts in a very different
                        perspective.</p>
                    <p>Shortages among civilian populations because of requisitions for the armed
                        forces, he points out, occur not only in Honan but also in Germany, and even
                        in Australia and the United States. As regards the situation in Honan, Mr.
                        Johnson holds that Chinese military requisitions are not solely responsible
                        but that the Japanese “have also taken grain from the Province.”</p>
                    <p>On the correspondent’s statement that Russian and French planes have been
                        held in reserve or hidden in the hills, Mr. Johnson adds that these planes
                        are ineffective against the Zero plane, and, furthermore, that since
                        gasoline is so scarce no plane will be in the air that does not have to be
                        there.</p>
                    <p>On the general question of the position of China in the war Mr. Johnson
                        replies most effectively and convincingly: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Certainly every American citizen, no matter what the Chinese do in
                                the war now, must be grateful for the eleven years of opposition
                                that the Chinese have put up to the highly-organized Japanese
                                aggression,—opposition which has placed China definitely on our side
                                of the fence, and not on the side of the Japanese.”<note n="57" xml:id="d108fn57">On October 1, the Adviser on Political
                                    Relations (Hornbeck) penciled his observations to the Secretary

                                    hereunder. I wish to call attention, however, to what to me are
                                    the most interesting features of the exhibit: namely, that an
                                    Australian newspaper correspondent wrote, after having spent a
                                    few weeks in China, an exceedingly pessimistic picture of China

                    <p>General Stilwell came in to see me at noon today, following my return to
                        Chungking. Major General Hearn was with him.</p>
                    <p>I commented that I had been going over with Mr. Atcheson the complaint
                        regarding the complacent attitude of the Chinese toward the war, the
                        representations made informally by Atcheson in influential quarters, and the
                        possibility of further effort on our part in this matter. I asked Stilwell
                        whether there had been any improvement in the situation.</p>
                    <p>He said “No” but later qualified that statement by saying that the Chinese
                        have restored the one-third of the appropriations for roads and air fields
                        which they had previously cut, but they still were not making the proposed
                        road a main highway; and he emphasized that there will be no real
                        improvement in the situation until the present Minister of War<note n="59" xml:id="d109fn59">General Ho Ying-chin.</note> is gotten out of office.
                        He mentioned as an example that while 90,000 troops are required for
                        replacements in Yunnan only about 60,000 have been ordered there and of that
                        60,000 probably only about 40,000 will arrive; then perhaps another 20,000
                        will be ordered in and only a percentage of them will arrive, and so on.</p>
                    <p>I told Stilwell that when I see the Generalissimo I intend if possible to
                        mention—in connection with our own increasing offensive efforts in the
                        Pacific—the great importance attached by us to vigorous prosecution by China
                        of the war against Japan by all means at China’s disposal. I commented that
                        I felt that with increased activity by the United Nations in other theaters
                        in the Pacific and as the Japanese are compelled to withdraw, their
                        withdrawal in my opinion might be into China and before the war is won we
                        may expect considerably increased military activity in the China theater
                        requiring an all-out effort of preparation in this theater. Stilwell agreed
                        with this, saying that he has been preaching the same thing for some
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned in confidence that consideration is being given, at the
                        suggestion of the Embassy, to a recommendation that the President include in
                        his congratulatory telegram to Chiang at the time of the latter’s
                        inauguration as President of the National Government—in the first half of
                        October, likely—an expression of his hope for or confidence <pb n="131" xml:id="pg_131" facs="0141"/>in China’s vigorous prosecution of the war
                        along with the increasing United Nations effort in other Pacific theaters. I
                        said that I favored such action. This congratulatory telegram might be a
                        suitable and convenient vehicle for a carefully phrased message, the intent
                        of which would not miscarry.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell said he favored such a message. He has been urging constantly that
                        China be prodded into increasing activity.</p>
                    <p>During the course of our conversation I took occasion to say to Stilwell that
                        it had occurred to me in going over the files on the subject of China’s
                        slackening war effort and the delay in providing air fields, roads, etc.,
                        that Stilwell has an “ace in the hole” which it seemed to me he might
                        consider playing, however unorthodox from a military point of view such
                        action might seem; that is, he might consider having General Chennault visit
                        Chungking and, after briefing him, let him have one of his intimate talks
                        with the Generalissimo and urge the necessity of getting these things done
                        which he needs in the military effort. I said that Chennault’s position with
                        the Generalissimo is unique and I believe he could add a considerable weight
                        in the general picture.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell apparently did not take to my suggestion. He commented that
                        Chennault of course is being used; he (Chennault) needs these air fields and
                        roads and so on, but “we all need them”; and he intimated that Chennault is
                        one of those who think we should use American money and go ahead and build
                        them—not look to the Chinese to provide them.</p>
                    <p>I dropped the matter there, feeling that I had gone as far as I could in
                        intimating to Stilwell that Chennault probably has more effective influence
                        with the Chinese Government in military matters than has Stilwell or any of
                        the rest of us, and that, having in mind always the end in view—which is
                        what counts—it might be desirable to bring Chennault more effectively into
                        the picture. I feel that if more cordial relations existed between Stilwell
                        and Chennault and they could act in harmony more could be gotten from the
                        Chinese.</p>

                            Affairs (Ballantine). In his memorandum Mr. Ballantine explained that
                            “with reference to the Ambassador’s suggestion … that the President
                            include in his congratulatory telegram to Generalissimo Chiang upon the
                            latter’s inauguration as President of China an expression <pb n="132" xml:id="pg_132" facs="0142"/>of hope for or confidence in China’s

                    <p>1807. Reference your 1302, September 17, 10 p.m. and 1315, September 18,
                        midnight. I have asked for appointment to pay respects to Generalissimo upon
                        my return to China but due to sessions of People’s Political Council it may
                        be a few days before I see him. When I do so I shall follow suggestion in
                        paragraph 2 of your 1302. Meanwhile I have spoken to Acting Foreign Minister
                        and shall do likewise with others as I meet them, supporting Atcheson’s
                        conversations which were excellently handled. Acting Foreign Minister said
                        instructions had been issued by Generalissimo to deal with matter.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell tells me that Chinese have restored the one-third of appropriations
                        for airfields and roads which they had cut, but he is not satisfied with the
                        general picture and thinks there can be little improvement until present
                        Minister of War is ousted. No such ouster is at all likely.</p>
                    <p>Supporting Atcheson’s suggestions in paragraph 3 of his 1674, September 11, I
                        am of opinion that proposed congratulatory telegram at time of
                        Generalissimo’s inauguration as President would be suitable vehicle for
                        carrying carefully prepared expression of confidence in vigorous prosecution
                        by China of the war against Japan by all means at China’s disposal in
                        fullest cooperation with American and other Allied forces as the United
                        Nations intensify their military efforts in the Pacific area.</p>
                    <p>Will report further after my conversation with Generalissimo but I do not
                        anticipate anything of particular interest is likely to develop at that

                    <p>Dr. Soong called on me at my request, for the purpose of an informal exchange
                        of information and comment in anticipation of his early departure for
                        Chungking.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong had informed me a few days ago that he expected to leave for
                        Chungking on September 30. I took occasion to inform him that I myself am
                        leaving within a few days for a short trip to London for purposes of
                        informal exploratory exchange of information and comment with personnel of
                        the B. F. O. regarding subjects in the Far Eastern field. Dr. Soong asked at
                        once: Why shouldn’t you also make a trip to China. I replied that I had for
                        a long time, in fact for several years, had in mind a trip to Chungking;
                        that I cannot at this moment be long away from the Department; but that I
                        have hope of being able sometime after coming back from this trip to make a
                        more or less similar visit to Chungking. Dr. Soong said that he and many of
                        his colleagues would welcome such a development.</p>
                    <p>I said that I had been turning over in my mind various matters which had come
                        up in discussion between Dr. Soong and me since his last return from
                        Chungking—especially matters which he had mentioned to me immediately after
                        his conversation of a few days ago with the Secretary on the subject of more
                        extensive representation for China in connection with agencies of war
                        planning. Dr. Soong had asked me on the telephone whether the Secretary had,
                        before leaving, given me any message for him, Soong, regarding his latest
                        representations. I had replied, and I now repeated it, that I had reason to
                        believe that the Secretary had spoken to the President regarding those
                        matters but that the Secretary had been extraordinarily hard pressed during
                        the two days preceding his departure for Hot Springs and had given me
                        nothing further on those subjects. I then took occasion to make a person to
                        person statement outlining some of the difficulties in fact which stand in
                        the way of its being possible for American officials in general to see
                        certain problems in quite the same light in which Chinese officialdom at
                        Chungking views them. I also took occasion to point out some of the facts in
                        the record of the contribution which the United States is making to the war
                        effort in its global terms and aspects, and of the assistance which the
                        United States has rendered to China, in a variety of forms, during the
                        period from 1937 to the present. Dr. Soong said that most of these facts
                        were familiar to him and that he was able, generally speaking, to understand
                        their significance and their effect as regarded the perspective <pb n="134" xml:id="pg_134" facs="0144"/>in which American officials view the war
                        problems, but that he finds it very difficult to make these things
                        understood to his Government in Chungking: in fact, he said, it could not be
                        expected that people there would see these things as people here see them.
                        He said that he himself was in a difficult position. I said that I was
                        constantly aware of some of the difficulties which attach to performance of
                        his duties by one in his position. I went on to say that it is, it seems to
                        me, one of the outstanding tasks of a Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                        especially one who is able to be a part of the time in his own country and a
                        part of the time abroad, to interpret his own country in the countries to
                        which he goes and to interpret to his own country the countries in which he
                        has special opportunity for first hand contacts.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then said that he wanted to talk to me about the matter of Tibet.
                        He said that, during his recent visit in London he had talked with the B. F.
                        O. about Tibet and had explained that the Chinese regard Tibet as an
                        integral part of China. A few days ago, he said, Sir George Sansom had come
                        to him under instructions and had informed him of anxiety on the part of the
                        B. F. O. regarding reports to the effect that Chinese troops are being
                        massed on the Tibetan border. He had, he said, stated to Sir George that
                        Tibet is an integral part of China and the Chinese Government regards
                        relations between Chinese authorities and Tibetan authorities as a Chinese
                        internal problem; and he had suggested that the British Government not make
                        representations at Chungking regarding this matter. He said that he, Soong,
                        was not informed regarding the alleged massing of Chinese troops; that he
                        doubted whether it was a fact; but that if there was or should be such a
                        development he did not believe that it would warrant apprehensions. There do
                        not exist, he said, any serious tensions between the Chinese and the
                        Tibetans. If there should arise difficulties, the Government at Chungking
                        would have to meet the problems just as it would have to meet similar
                        problems if they arose in any other part of China.</p>
                    <p>I took occasion to ask what proportion of the people of China proper are
                        aware of the existence of Tibet or take any interest in that area or what
                        occurs there. Dr. Soong replied that all Chinese who have had any schooling
                        have learned in their study of geography that Tibet is a part of China; that
                        it has never occurred to them that there is any question about this as a
                        matter of simple fact; and that these are, politically speaking, the Chinese
                        people. I then asked whether the same was true with regard to Mongolia. Dr.
                        Soong replied in the affirmative. He went on to say, however, that, Tibet
                        being something of a land of mystery, Chinese students and scholars gain
                        more vivid impressions regarding that area, as they study geography and
                        history, than regarding the more prosaic of the outlying areas. He said, <pb n="135" xml:id="pg_135" facs="0145"/>further, that he had suggested to
                        the British that the question of Tibet was relatively of so much less
                        importance than a number of other immediate and more significant problems of
                        concern both to the British Empire and to China that the British ought not
                        make or let it become an issue. I made the remark that that expression of
                        opinion was one susceptible of being turned by the British against the
                        Chinese. Dr. Soong replied: Yes, it might be, for purposes of argument, but,
                        China’s interest and China’s claim regarding Tibet are far better founded in
                        history and in law than are those of India and Great Britain. I made the
                        remark that on the basis of geography Tibet abuts upon China proper on the
                        east and upon India to the south. Dr. Soong replied: Of course, but Tibet is
                        a part of China.</p>
                    <p>I said that I wondered what is the popular concept, from point of view
                        geographically, historically and politically, regarding Korea.<note n="62" xml:id="d111fn62">For information regarding Korea, see bracketed note,
                                <ref target="#pg_893">p. 893</ref>.</note> Dr. Soong replied that
                        the Chinese in no sense think of Korea as a part, or a lost part, of an
                        existing or a once having existed Chinese Empire. Nor, he added, do they so
                        think of Indo-China.<note n="63" xml:id="d111fn63">For correspondence
                            regarding Indochina, see <ref target="#pg_882">pp. 882</ref> ff.</note>
                        In their current thinking regarding postwar settlements, the prevalent
                        Chinese opinion runs, he said, to the idea that Korea should be put under an
                        international trusteeship. Indo-China also, he said, the Chinese today
                        regard as an area the disposal of which would best be made in terms of a
                        trusteeship. There followed some discussion of difficulties which
                        conceivably might be encountered should effort be made to apply that
                        principle in each and/or in both of these cases.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then said that he wanted to bring to my attention a situation which
                        exists at Chungking. He said that, speaking frankly and with regret, he must
                        tell me that relations between Chinese authorities and the American military
                        authorities are “sour”. He said that this was one among many reasons why the
                        Chinese felt insistently that they ought to be given more extensive
                        representation in military councils in Washington. I said that I was sorry
                        to hear what he said regarding the situation in Chungking but that I
                        wondered how and to what degree the question of representation in Washington
                        could be tied up with or would bring about amelioration of an unsatisfactory
                        relationship, as described by him, in Chungking. Dr. Soong replied that, if
                        China were represented in combined staffs meetings here, her representative
                        would be able frankly to report upon and to discuss such matters and there
                        would be likelihood of their being remedied. I inquired whether, with or
                        without such representation, China’s Military Attaché or Dr. Soong himself
                        could not present China’s views—either formally or informally. Dr. Soong
                        replied that in time of war military attachés have limited entree and little
                            <pb n="136" xml:id="pg_136" facs="0146"/>weight; and that such matters
                        can be dealt with effectively only between and among military men
                        functioning in constituted and authorized groups on a common high level. Dr.
                        Soong went on to say that the Chinese find it very difficult to work with
                        General Stilwell; Stilwell’s ideas and those of the Chinese High Command do
                        not, he said, harmonize; the Chinese feel, he said, that Stilwell is
                        uncooperative; he, Soong, while in Chungking last spring, worked hard as a
                        go-between and he found, he said, that practically all of the Chinese, both
                        military and civilian, who had occasion to have contact with Stilwell found
                        Stilwell’s attitude, etc. unsatisfactory and his approach to common problems
                        such as to constitute an obstacle to effective cooperation. He went on to
                        say that, although Stilwell may be highly qualified as a military man and a
                        commander of his own forces, the Chinese feel that, to qualify for high
                        command in a position which involves widespread contact with and cooperation
                        with personnel equal or superior in rank and not under his command, an
                        officer needs to have personal, political and diplomatic assets in addition
                        to his qualifications as a soldier. I called attention to various of General
                        Stilwell’s special qualifications for performance in China, such as his
                        previous experience in that country, his knowledge of the language, his long
                        acquaintance with and friendly feelings toward many of China’s leaders, and
                        the energy and the devotion with which he has thrown himself into the task
                        of training and equipping Chinese soldiers and officers. Dr. Soong replied
                        that, notwithstanding these qualifications, there were other qualifications,
                        especially those which have to do with attitude in personal relationships,
                        which are needed for effective performance in the task of cooperative effort
                        which appertains to the position which General Stilwell holds—and he implied
                        that General Stilwell is deficient as regards those other qualifications. By
                        way, apparently, of illustrating and underscoring, Dr. Soong said that
                        General Chennault has proven himself to be an outstanding military man and
                        at the same time has effectively cooperated with and has become and is <hi rend="italic">persona grata</hi> with and among all of his Chinese
                        contacts. I remarked that it is gratifying to us to hear this regarding
                        General Chennault, but I could not but wonder whether, as between General
                        Stilwell and his Chinese contacts, there is not some fault on the Chinese
                        side. We have in fact, I said, heard made in criticism of the Chinese not a
                        few statements similar to those which Dr. Soong had just made to me
                        regarding Stilwell. Dr. Soong replied that probably there was some fault on
                        the Chinese side, but that, fault or no fault, and regardless on which side
                        the greater fault lies, the simple fact is that in the relations between his
                        Chinese contacts and Stilwell there is not mutually and reciprocally the
                        harmony, the cooperativeness and the effectiveness which should exist in
                        such a relationship. <pb n="137" xml:id="pg_137" facs="0147"/>Under those
                        circumstances, he said, no matter what may be the “oughts” of the situation,
                        there cannot be achieved the unity of purpose and of effort which, for the
                        good of China, of the United States, and of the allied cause, should
                        prevail. Dr. Soong added that he greatly regretted having to mention and to
                        dwell upon this point, but that, confronted with military and political
                        problems of utmost importance, it is right and necessary that governments be
                        frank with one another in matters of common concern, that this is an
                        important matter of common concern, and that he hoped that we would accept
                        in the spirit in which it was given the exposition which he had made of the
                        Chinese view in and regarding this situation. I replied that it is well for
                        us to know the Chinese view, that it seemed to me utterly right that he
                        should inform us regarding it, but that I was sure that he would realize
                        that it would be difficult for us to see a question of this sort in quite
                        the light in which the Chinese see it. Dr. Soong remarked: Naturally, I
                        understand that, but please keep in mind that this is a situation which
                        exists in China, at our capital, and which therefore interests and affects
                        us Chinese more intimately than would be the case if, in reverse, it were a
                        situation which existed in Washington.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then rose to leave. He expressed gratification that we had been
                        able to have this lengthy and frank conversation, and mutual expressions of
                            <hi rend="italic">bon voyage</hi> were exchanged.</p>

                        association by Chinese with foreigners, I have the honor to enclose a copy
                        of despatch No. 26 of August 2, 1943, from the Consul at Kweilin entitled:
                        “Regulations Promulgated by the Executive Yuan in regard to Entertainment of

                            seems to be no relaxation in the enforcement of these regulations in
                            Kweilin and that Chinese intellectuals, in their contacts with
                            foreigners, appear to be singled out for surveillance by the police with
                            consequent lessened opportunities for association by foreigners with

                        the effect of these regulations was felt at the time of their reported
                        promulgation but that after an initial period of caution on the part of
                        Chinese there has been no attempt to observe them. It remains a fact that
                        the vast majority of Chinese officials at Chungking are still reluctant to
                        discuss freely with foreigners any questions which might imply criticism of

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Reference is made to telegrams in regard, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, to the reported withdrawal of Japanese
                        troops from China, as follows: Embassy’s 1793, September 24, 9 a.m.; 1816,
                        September 28, 9 a.m.; 1818, September 28, 11 a.m.; and 1923, October 12, 4

                            printed.</note> There is now enclosed copy of despatch no. 82, October
                        2, 1943 from the Embassy officer at Sian, reporting information on this
                        subject as related to him by travelers arriving from the occupied areas and
                        by official Chinese sources.</p>
                    <p>According to the despatch, the number of Japanese troops withdrawn from north
                        China is not known, but it must be considerable and they are doubtless being
                        transferred to more active or potentially active theaters of operations in
                        eastern Asia. The withdrawals, if they have actually been taking place,
                        would appear to indicate that the Japanese entertain little fear of the
                        consequences of possible Chinese offensive operations in north China.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that, according
                            to information received from travelers arriving from the
                            Japanese-occupied areas and from official Chinese sources, the Japanese
                            appear to be carrying out <pb n="139" xml:id="pg_139" facs="0149"/>a
                            policy of a gradual reduction of Japanese garrisons in north China.
                            These reductions are reported to be occurring not so much in important
                            military centers such as Yuncheng, Taiyuan, Sinsiang, Kaifeng, Hsuchow,
                            et cetera, as in outlying garrison posts. It is asserted that some of
                            the less important posts have been abandoned altogether, in others the
                            proportion of Japanese troops has been reduced and that of Chinese
                            puppet forces increased, and in others puppet units have taken over
                            entirely from the Japanese. The number of Japanese troops withdrawn from
                            north China in this manner is not known, but it must be considerable;
                            they are doubtless being transferred to more active or potentially more
                            active theaters of operations in eastern Asia.</p>
                        <p>Continued Japanese troop withdrawals from the north China theater, if
                            true, would appear to indicate that the Japanese entertain little fear
                            of the consequences of possible Chinese offensive operations in that
                            area. The vastly superior communication facilities of the Japanese and
                            their system of defense fortifications are doubtless relied upon to a
                            great extent by the Japanese to stem potential Chinese offensive
                            operations in the north China theater.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Department’s
                        telegraphic instruction no. 1302, September 17, 10 p.m. suggesting that,
                        when calling upon General Chiang Kai-shek upon my return to Chungking I
                        mention the great importance attached by the American Government to vigorous
                        prosecution by China of the war against Japan, and requesting that Mr.
                        Atcheson report the reactions of Chinese officials to his earlier approaches
                        in regard to China’s war effort and that I also report on any approaches I
                        might make. Reference is also made to related correspondence including the
                        Embassy’s telegrams nos. 1674, September 11 and 1711, September 15 and the
                        Embassy’s despatch no. 1589, September 17, 1943 (enclosing copies of
                            memoranda<note n="67" xml:id="d114fn67">One memorandum printed, <ref target="#pg_123">p. 123</ref>.</note> of Mr. Atcheson’s

                    <p>I reported in my 1807, September 26 that General Stilwell had informed me
                        that as a result of Mr. Atcheson’s conversations the Chinese Government had
                        restored one-third of the appropriations for airfields and roads which had
                        been cut but that he was not satisfied with the general picture. A
                        memorandum of my conversation of September 25 with General Stilwell was
                        enclosed with my despatch no. 1626, September 27.</p>
                    <p>In my 1871, October 6, I reported briefly in regard to my call on General
                        Chiang Kai-shek on October 4 during which suitable opportunity was found to
                        emphasize the determination with which the Government and people of the
                        United States are devoting themselves to winning the war and to say that the
                        United States looked to its Allies, including China, to put forth all
                        effort, with the resources at their command, in cooperation with us to that
                        end. I reported also that General Chiang said that China could be counted
                        upon to do her share. A memorandum of my conversation with General Chiang is
                        enclosed. (The question of Russian relations with the other United Nations
                        as discussed with the Generalissimo was reported in my 1914, October 11,
                            noon.)<note n="70" xml:id="d114fn70">

               </p>
                    <p>Prior to my conversation with the Generalissimo (earlier opportunity to see
                        him did not arise because of his occupation with the Plenary Session of the
                        C. E. C. and the subsequent meeting of the People’s Political Council), I
                        had a long conversation on October [<hi rend="italic">September</hi>] 24
                        with Dr. K. C. Wu, Acting Foreign Minister. A memorandum of this
                        conversation is enclosed. As regards the question of the war effort I
                        indicated that my personal opinion was similar to that recently expressed to
                        Dr. Wu by Mr. Atcheson (Embassy’s 1711, September 15 and despatch no. 1589,
                        September 17) and I said that it seemed to me that as the United Nations war
                        effort became intensified in this area there was strong likelihood that the
                        Japanese—pressed in the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean and Burma—might
                        undertake an all-out effort against China; hence it would be necessary for
                        all of us, including China, to exert the heaviest possible military effort
                        to prevent Japanese success. Dr. Wu replied that he fully appreciated the
                        situation; that as he had mentioned to Mr. Atcheson following their
                        conversation he had gone at once to the Generalissimo and he could say now
                        that the Generalissimo had issued appropriate instructions. During the
                        course of my conversation with Dr. Wu, the latter brought up the question of
                        the Kuomintang-Communist situation and also the subject of articles recently
                        published in the United States which were critical of China. These aspects
                        of the conversation are described in some detail in the enclosed
                        memorandum.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="pg_141" facs="0151"/>
                    <p>In addition to talking with President Chiang and Dr. Wu, I have had
                        conversations with a number of high Chinese officials during which
                        opportunity occurred for me to make remarks along the lines of those
                        suggested by the Department in its 1302, September 17. Among these officials
                        have been Dr. H. H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and
                        concurrently Minister of Finance; Dr. Wang Chung-hui, Secretary General of
                        the National Defense Council and former Foreign Minister; General Ho
                        Ying-chin, Chief of Staff and Minister of War; Dr. Wang Shih-chieh, former
                        Minister of Education and recently Secretary General of the Central Planning
                        Board, who has considerable influence with the Generalissimo and who is
                        probably shortly proceeding to England as the head of a good will mission;
                        General Wu Teh-chen, Secretary General of the Kuomintang Headquarters; Dr.
                        Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan; Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Minister of
                        Economic Affairs; Dr. Tseng Yang-fu, Minister of Communications; Dr. Quo
                        Tai-chi, former Ambassador to Great Britain and also former Foreign
                        Minister; and Dr. T. V. Soong, Foreign Minister, who has just returned to
                        Chungking. My conversations with these officials were along lines similar to
                        those taken in my conversations with General Chiang and Dr. Wu and their
                        responses and attitudes were in general similar to those of the
                        Generalissimo and the Acting Foreign Minister. Looking back over those
                        conversations it seems to me that of the officials other than the
                        Generalissimo, the most satisfactory interest in the problem presented was
                        exhibited by Dr. K. C. Wu and General Wu Teh-chen; the latter on his own
                        initiative took occasion on October 14 to inquire of Mr. Atcheson if any
                        improvement had occurred in the situation and he indicated that he had made
                        endeavor to cause improvement.</p>
                    <p>As regards the general question of Sino-American relations, my impression
                        from my conversations with Chinese officials since my return to Chungking
                        has been that they are almost universally and sincerely friendly to the
                        United States; that they look upon the United States as China’s best friend;
                        and that they are anxious that China maintain the good opinion as well as
                        the good will of the United States. While their continuing interest in the
                        Hanson Baldwin article in the August <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi>
                        and in other published articles critical of China on the one hand gave some
                        definite indication that the criticism was resented, I could not escape the
                        impression also that the criticism had struck home sufficiently to influence
                        Chinese leaders to endeavor to take steps which might put the Chinese
                        Government and its activities in a better light to American observers,
                        especially observers in the United States. (Various aspects of this
                        consideration have been discussed in the Embassy’s recent despatches in
                        regard to the Central <pb n="142" xml:id="pg_142" facs="0152"/>Executive
                        Committee meeting in Chungking early in September and in regard to the
                        subsequent meeting of the People’s Political Council.) For example, Dr. Quo
                        Tai-chi, who is an intelligent and enlightened official of considerable
                        experience and who will probably again in the future assume some important
                        Government post, stated his opinion that the criticism had already had good
                        effect in China and that from the long range point of view it was preferable
                        that it had occurred now rather than later as there would probably result
                        the striking of a balance in regard to China in the American mind which
                        would preclude at some later time a sudden reaction from the current
                        “idealization” of China which might be most adverse. Dr. Quo also stated
                        that he felt that China had been vastly overpraised in the United States
                        since the United States became involved in the war and he seemed to feel
                        that the recent criticism constituted a beneficial leaven in connection with
                        this aspect of the situation. Dr. Quo’s remarks on this and related
                        questions are being made the subject of a separate despatch.<note n="71" xml:id="d114fn71">No. 1695, October 18, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</note>

                    <p>In conclusion, I would say that while we have perhaps succeeded in impressing
                        upon some officials the need for increased and more effective war effort on
                        the part of China and while also there may be resulting some minor
                        improvement in some aspects of the situation, we cannot safely count under
                        present conditions (which involve of course the question of equipment for
                        the Chinese forces) on effecting any significant psychological change in the
                        Chinese attitude which will impel China’s leaders and soldiers to put forth
                        materially greater effort in the war against Japan. The Chinese have
                        persuaded themselves that the war in Europe will shortly end and that the
                        United States, possibly with help from Great Britain, will defeat Japan;
                        that the Chinese are too tired and too worn and too ill-equipped to make
                        greater effort, especially when such effort may not be necessary; and that
                        the Chinese can sit back, holding what they have against the Japanese, and
                        concentrate their planning upon China’s post-war political and economic
                            problems.<note n="72" xml:id="d114fn72">In a memorandum dated November
                            25 to the Under Secretary of State (Stettinius) the Chief of the
                            Division of Far Eastern Affairs (Ballantine) suggested that the summary
                            of Ambassador Gauss’ views contained in the last paragraph be brought
                            “to the attention of the President.” Mr. Stettinius concurred in a
                            memorandum of November 30 to the Secretary of State; and a memorandum in
                            which this last paragraph was extracted was sent to President Roosevelt
                            on December 2.</note>

                        <p>The Ambassador, accompanied by Mr. Atcheson, called on the Generalissimo
                            by appointment at five o’clock this afternoon. The conversation opened
                            with the usual exchange of amenities and further exchanges occurred
                            during its course. The Generalissimo said he was very glad to see the
                            Ambassador back and inquired after his health and the health of the
                            President and of Secretary Hull. The Ambassador said that he brought to
                            the Generalissimo cordial greetings and best wishes from the President
                            and the Secretary of State; he said that on his return journey he had
                            learned that the Generalissimo had been elected President of the
                            National Government of China and he wished to offer his most cordial
                            congratulations. The Generalissimo showed pleasure and a very friendly
                            appreciation of the message of greetings and of the congratulations.</p>
                        <p>General Chiang exhibited an almost immediate interest in the question of
                            Soviet Russian relations. He asked whether Mr. Hull would personally
                            attend the tripartite Foreign Minister’s conference. The Ambassador
                            replied he had no official information but assumed from recent press
                            reports that he would attend in person. He then asked where conference
                            would be held. Mr. Gauss stated that when he left Washington there had
                            been no announcement on the subject. General Chiang then asked what was
                            the opinion in Washington when Mr. Gauss left as to Soviet continuance
                            in the war and collaboration with partners of the United Nations. The
                            Ambassador replied that he had not discussed this subject with higher
                            authorities in Washington but that from his conversations in official
                            circles generally he had the definite impression that there was full
                            American confidence that Soviet Russia would continue in the war and in
                            collaboration with partners of the United Nations. The Generalissimo
                            commented that there had always been deep suspicion of Soviet intentions
                            and subject was one of great importance. Mr. Gauss replied that he had
                            of course noted press speculation regarding intentions of Soviet Russia;
                            that while there had been mutual suspicion between Soviet Russia and
                            other Powers for many years and it might take some time fully to <pb n="144" xml:id="pg_144" facs="0154"/>break down any such suspicion
                            still lingering in the minds of unofficial observers, there seemed in
                            official circles at home to be every indication of confidence that
                            relations with the Soviet would continue on a satisfactory basis and
                            that the meeting of the Foreign Ministers would be successful in
                            clarifying objectives and policies in matters of mutual concern and
                            interest with reference to the European theatre of the war.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo inquired as to American post-war problems. The
                            Ambassador replied that, while there were groups in the Government and
                            out of the Government—some consisting of the best brains of the
                            country—which were giving intensive study to post-war problems, the main
                            energies of the American Government and of the American people were now
                            concentrated whole-heartedly in making an all-out effort to accomplish
                            the immediate task of achieving victory over the common enemy. Mr. Gauss
                            said that he had found a tremendous war effort during his visit to the
                            United States and described for the Generalissimo various aspects of the
                            general picture of the determined and increasing war effort of the
                            United States which was absorbing the mental and physical efforts of all
                            Americans. He said that there was not the slightest question that the
                            American Government and the American people were completely determined
                            to win the war and to fight on with ever increasing vigor and weight in
                            battle and in production until victory should be achieved; that victory
                            to us meant only one thing—unconditional surrender by Japan as well as
                            by Italy and Germany. The Ambassador said that in the tremendous and
                            relentless effort which the American Government, the expanding American
                            armed forces and the single-minded American people were putting forth
                            the United States looked to its Allies such as Britain and Russia and
                            China to make a similarly whole-hearted effort toward victory; that the
                            victory could not be the victory of any one country alone but must be a
                            victory of the United Nations; that the only way to win the peace was
                            first to win a complete victory in the war and whole-hearted effort by
                            all partners or allies was required to achieve that end.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Gauss went on to say that he realized—and he had made it clear at
                            home in conversations with American officials—that all the Allies could
                            not be expected to contribute an equal share to the war effort because
                            some were limited by their capacities or resources. He said that it was
                            obvious that China’s effort was limited in some directions by lack of
                            military equipment and that not only recently but throughout his tour of
                            duty as American Ambassador to China he had consistently put forward the
                            thesis that it would be a mistake to expect, or to count on, a
                            contribution to the war from China that was physically greater than
                            China’s capacities; but that he hoped, and he had <pb n="145" xml:id="pg_145" facs="0155"/>every confidence, that the Chinese
                            Government would put forth every effort of which China was capable
                            within the limits of its resources, and this was most important to the
                            success of the United Nations in defeating Japan. The Generalissimo said
                            that China may be counted upon to do her full share. He added that when
                            the Burma Road is opened China can receive necessary arms and equipment
                            and do more.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo entered into a lengthy dissertation on the question of
                            American-Chinese cooperation which was the only portion of his remarks
                            which appeared to fall into the usual and traditional formula of
                            official conversations. His comments nevertheless seemed to reflect
                            appreciation of American friendship for China and he said that it was
                            his observation that of all the peoples of the world Americans and
                            Chinese found it easiest and most natural to get along with each other.
                            In his reply the Ambassador expressed hearty agreement and described in
                            some detail how impressed he was with the proof of the Generalissimo’s
                            statement to be found in the Chinese air training station at Karachi
                            where Chinese and American officers and Chinese and American mechanics
                            and other enlisted men not only worked together in understanding and
                            friendship but lived together, ate together and had their recreation
                            together. Mr. Gauss spoke also of the productive results of the air
                            training program, including the training of Chinese air cadets in the
                            United States, and mentioned how successful it was proving with Chinese
                            pilots incorporated into units of our Air Force in China and flying and
                            fighting side by side with American airmen.</p>
                        <p>At the close of the conversation the Generalissimo inquired whether the
                            Ambassador was taking up residence on the North Bank or the South Bank.
                            The Ambassador stated that he was now living in the city not far from
                            the Generalissimo’s residence, that he was available at any time the
                            Generalissimo wished to see him as he was always at the Generalissimo’s
                            command and that he would be glad to be of any possible service at any
                            time. The Generalissimo replied with repeated thanks.</p>
                        <p>The conversation lasted some fifty minutes. The Generalissimo was most
                            pleasant and friendly throughout and both in his greetings and goodbyes
                            showed more than ordinary cordiality both to the Ambassador and to Mr.
                            Atcheson.</p>
                        <p>Following the conversation Mr. Li stated to Mr. Atcheson that it had been
                            one of the “happiest” conversations with the Generalissimo that he had
                            witnessed.</p>

                        <p>The Ambassador called on Dr. Wu by appointment this afternoon to pay his
                            respects upon his return to China. A long and very friendly and informal
                            conversation ensued in regard to various questions affecting
                            Sino-American relations and the war effort, most of which arose out of
                            inquiries made by Dr. Wu as to the Ambassador’s opinion and as to the
                            opinion of the American Government and people in respect to these
                            matters.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wu said that there had recently been articles published in the United
                            States which were quite critical of China and which indicated that some
                            Americans did not think that China was proceeding along democratic lines
                            and that the Chinese armed forces were not doing their utmost to defeat
                            the enemy. He asked what the Ambassador’s impression of this development
                            was. Mr. Gauss said that he had been aware that there had been such
                            criticism of China in various press and magazine articles; that we at
                            home are of course used to having our own government criticized; that
                            American writers and critics were accustomed not only to criticize
                            vigorously and with full freedom their own government but any aspect of
                            American life with which they were in disagreement; that they were also
                            accustomed to criticizing foreign governments and foreign countries;
                            that China was by no means the only country which came in for such
                            criticism; and that on the other hand there had probably been less
                            American criticism of China than of, say, Great Britain and Russia in
                            regard to various questions which arose from time to time. Dr. Wu said
                            that the Chinese did not really mind criticism from Americans, as the
                            United States was China’s best friend, and that China really welcomed
                            honest criticism and hoped to take advantage therefrom. Mr. Gauss
                            mentioned that writers in the United States were not always fully
                            cognizant of the facts in connection with developments and conditions in
                            China and Mr. Atcheson remarked that in these days it was difficult for
                            such writers to obtain accurate and comprehensive information on these
                            subjects. Mr. Atcheson added that, with respect to Hanson Baldwin’s
                            article in the August <hi rend="italic">Reader’s Digest</hi>, it was of
                            course absurd for Mr. Baldwin to voice the traditional Japanese
                            propaganda line that China was not a nation but a geographic area and
                            that the <pb n="147" xml:id="pg_147" facs="0157"/>American people and
                            American Government naturally did not have—and had never exhibited—any
                            such attitude toward the Chinese nation.</p>
                        <p>As regards the question of the war effort the Ambassador indicated that
                            his personal opinion was similar to that recently expressed to Dr. Wu by
                            Mr. Atcheson and he said that it seemed to him that as the United
                            Nations war effort became intensified in this area—as it certainly would
                            be greatly intensified and the intensification had already begun—there
                            was the strong likelihood that the Japanese, pressed in the south
                            Pacific, the Indian Ocean and Burma, might make something like an
                            all-out effort against China. The Ambassador said that in the light of
                            this likelihood it would be necessary for all of us, including China, to
                            exert the heaviest possible military effort to prevent Japanese success.
                            Dr. Wu replied that he concurred and the Japanese would certainly like
                            to knock China completely out of the picture. He went on to speak of
                            China’s six-year-long struggle and great difficulties and he said in a
                            humorous vein that the Chinese could not merely with spears do very much
                            against the Japanese. Mr. Gauss replied in the same vein that spears had
                            proven excellent weapons in the past in case of necessity and could be
                            used again and he mentioned that military equipment including air
                            matériel was increasingly coming into China. Dr. Wu said that, quite
                            seriously, he fully appreciated the situation; that as he had mentioned
                            to Mr. Atcheson following their conversation in regard to the war effort
                            he had gone at once to the Generalissimo, and he could say now that the
                            Generalissimo had issued appropriate instructions.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wu turned the conversation on the Kuomintang-Communist situation and
                            suggested that the Ambassador offer an opinion in this matter. Mr. Gauss
                            said that this was, of course, an internal domestic problem and then
                            went on to make remarks indicative of, from our point of view, the need
                            of maintaining unity in China and of avoiding any dissension which might
                            adversely affect the war effort.</p>
                        <p>The Ambassador took occasion to mention that our people at home were very
                            pleased with the successful showing in battle made by the Chinese air
                            cadets trained in the United States, the effective way in which they had
                            been incorporated into units of the 14th Air Force and their general
                            spirit of cooperation and fighting ability when put to the test.</p>
                        <p>Before our departure Dr. Wu made a number of extremely friendly remarks
                            in regard to the Ambassador’s return to China, said that he and other
                            officials of the Chinese Government were aware that Mr. Gauss had made
                            consistent efforts while in Chungking to obtain more aid for China and
                            that the Chinese were very glad to welcome him back as an old and valued
                            friend.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of a
                        strictly confidential memorandum of conversation dated October 12,
                            1943,<note n="73" xml:id="d115fn73">Not printed.</note> with Dr. Quo
                        Tai-chi, former Chinese Ambassador to London and former Chinese Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs, in which he expressed his views regarding recent American
                        press criticism of China and related subjects. Dr. Quo’s remarks are of
                        interest as representing those of an extremely keen Chinese observer who,
                        speaking privately and without the inhibitions imposed by high public
                        office, made frank observations of a nature which are at present very
                        infrequently heard in high Chinese Government circles although, we
                        understand, his opinions are shared by a number of other liberal-minded and
                        enlightened Chinese.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Dr. Quo stated that he felt that the
                            recent American press criticism of China has produced good results and
                            by inference pointed to the recent indications thereof contained in the
                            resolution on constitutional government adopted by the Plenary Session
                            of the C. E. C. in September. He expressed opinion that the traditional
                            and fundamental democratic traits of the Chinese people were certain to
                            be given expression in time and that criticism by sincere friends, such
                            as Americans, was needed both by China and by the Chinese Government to
                            hasten the process. Dr. Quo repeated an observation previously made to
                            the effect that there has been too much “idealization” of China in the
                            United States and that it was far more desirable to clear the air now
                            with American criticism of China than at a later period when a sudden
                            and strong adverse reaction might result (Embassy’s telegram No. 999,
                            June 23, 9 a.m. for expression of similar view). He expressed belief
                            that some of the overpraise of China had been due to “professional
                            friends of China” who were motivated by self-interest.</p>
                        <p>Referring to President Chiang Kai-shek’s book, <hi rend="italic">China’s
                                Destiny</hi>, Dr. Quo said that President Chiang had been
                            ill-advised to write such a book and that it had been the subject of
                            much criticism both from Chinese and from foreign friends of China. He
                            felt, however, that the book represented the ideas of President Chiang
                            in many respects notwithstanding that the book had been ghost-written.
                            Dr. Quo expressed the opinion that President Chiang had a secure place
                            in one of the three categories of persons described by the Chinese as
                            “immortals” as a leader whose efforts helped build up the nation, but
                            that it was a mistake for him to seek to achieve immortality as a
                            philosopher and a great writer as well. (Embassy’s despatch No. 1220,

                        <p>While there has been resentment in Kuomintang circles of the recent
                            American press criticism of China, liberal elements here approve this
                            criticism, feeling that it has had a beneficial effect on the Chinese
                            Government and was largely responsible for the C. E. C. resolution on
                            constitutional government at its Plenary Session in September. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>

                    <p>Approval of American press criticism of China, such as that voiced by Dr.
                        Quo, is fairly widespread among liberal elements in China, who feel that the
                        article by Pearl Buck in a May issue of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> to a
                        great extent and the articles by Hanson Baldwin and T. A. Bisson in the July
                        issue of <hi rend="italic">The Far Eastern Survey</hi> to a lesser degree
                        have had a salutory effect on the Chinese Government (Embassy’s telegrams
                        No. 1357, August 2, 12 noon, and No. 1444, August 13, 11 a.m.). One well
                        known non-Kuomintang Chinese close to Dr. Sun Fo has stated to an officer of
                        the Embassy that while many Kuomintang leaders resented the articles it was
                        generally felt in liberal circles that only “Chinese fascists” could really
                        find fault with Pearl Buck’s article. This Chinese added that she would be
                        doing a further service to China if she were to publish an article drawing a
                        comparison between “Chungking democracy” and “real democracy”. Many Chinese
                        feel, however, that the effect of the Bisson article was lessened by his
                        statement that there existed two Chinas (a democratic China in the Communist
                        areas and a feudalistic China in the Kuomintang areas), but they admit that
                        while the article was less warmly received than that of Mrs. Buck it too had
                        in general a desirable influence.</p>
                    <p>So far as the Embassy knows there was no indication of any Kuomintang
                        intention to interest itself in the question of constitutional government in
                        China prior to the publication of these critical articles in question. The
                        belief is generally held by informed Chinese here that the action of the C.
                        E. C. at its Plenary Session in September in adopting the resolution on
                        constitutional government grew almost entirely out of a desire to meet
                        American criticism of the lack of democracy in China (Embassy’s telegrams

                    <p>The greatest resentment has been against the Baldwin article, especially the
                        author’s use of the term “geographical expression” as applied to China—a
                        repetition of a well known Japanese propaganda line. The Chinese military
                        have been especially resentful of his charges against the Chinese army and
                        according to a confidential report from the 14th U. S. Air Force the Central

                        however, had some desirable repercussions, for it is reliably reported that
                        Chiang Kai-shek subsequently issued orders to commanders of Central
                        Government troops in some areas to carry out at least one attack a month
                        against the Japanese. There has been in recent weeks an increasing number of
                        press reports of Chinese military engagements with the Japanese, which may
                        have resulted from a Chinese desire for more publicity regarding Chinese
                        military activity as well as from Japanese operations against bases which
                        might be used by American planes for bombing of Japan. The Ministry of
                        Information has also endeavored to refute this criticism and at a recent
                        press conference Government spokesmen assured foreign press correspondents
                        that China still placed victory before postwar reconstruction and desired
                        the opening of the Burma Road in order to enable the Chinese army to be
                        furnished the weapons necessary for “her counter-offensive against Japan”
                        (Embassy’s despatch No. 1676, October 14, 1943).<note n="78" xml:id="d115fn78">Not printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Some Kuomintang Chinese, resentful of the criticism, have sought to find an
                        ulterior motive behind what they term “a sudden wave of criticism of China”
                        from the United States. The local English language daily recently published
                        a letter from a Japanese and American educated Chinese active in one of the
                        National Military Council’s intelligence organs charging the American
                        writers with “guttersnipe journalism”. These are reactions perhaps typical
                        of the chauvinistic element in China which, long fed on American overpraise
                        of China, cannot now accept any criticism as being well intentioned or
                        justified. Many liberal Chinese, however, apparently feel that the United
                        States represents the major external force which can exert influence on the
                        Chinese scene toward the establishment of a democratic China. They suspect
                        that Great Britain under its present leadership gives primary consideration
                        to its position in the Far East, that the absence of British press criticism
                        of China is not purely accidental and that the British Government feels no
                        concern for the spread of democratic principles in China. They are of the
                        opinion that if China is to have a liberal democratic form of government the
                        encouragement and impetus from without can come only from the United States,
                        and they thus derive a quiet satisfaction from American criticism of many of
                        the present-day fascist trends in this country.</p>

                    <p>1495. Comments on statements in regard to the Far East made by Senators who
                        recently returned from a visit to the fighting fronts have centered largely
                        on statements relating to Soviet-Japanese relations and to the question of
                        American airplane bases in Siberia. Comparatively little has been said about
                        China.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the views of certain Senators as indicated below will be
                        of interest to the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>In a speech on September 30 in the Senate reporting on his trip, Senator
                        Lodge in speaking of “the dangerous results of sugary and overdrawn
                        propaganda” of our Government said: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“We must not perpetrate any more of these false notions. We invite
                                ultimate cynicism, disillusionment, and even hatred of our allies if
                                we do so.</p>
                            <p>I have seen small signs of this already. Many of our young men, for
                                example, come to China imbued with the idea that China is a great
                                modern democracy with millions of men fighting with their backs to
                                the wall. Upon arrival they find this is not the case. With the
                                impetuousness of youth they thereupon go to the other extreme. They
                                overlook the industry, good-humor, and democratic attitude of the
                                individual Chinese once they have discovered that the Central
                                Government is not like ours. They overlook the fact that due to the
                                Chinese Army 15 Japanese divisions are in China, in spite of the
                                fact that the Chinese Army, to put it mildly, is not comparable to
                                ours. They overlook the advantage to America in having a strong
                                China. It would be better for China and for us if a true picture
                                were given to the American people. When Oliver Cromwell had his
                                portrait painted he said to the artist, ‘Paint me as I am, the wart
                                and all.’ The truth about China is in many ways inspiring, and China
                                as she now stands is a real military asset to the United States. Her
                                achievements can be more accurately measured if her difficulties are
                                more clearly realized.”</p>

               </p>
                    <p>Senator Chandler is quoted in the press as stating “I’ve been to those China
                        air bases and I’ve talked to the men there. We’re apt to lose them unless
                        more support is given.” He is said also to have warned that Stilwell and
                        Chennault needed great aid immediately, to have asserted that the British
                        were “lukewarm” in the war against Japan, and to have stated that the United
                        States would be in a serious position if it lost its bases in China and had
                        none in Russia either.</p>
                    <p>Senator Russell is reported to have taken the British to task for not
                        launching an offensive in Burma although he expressed confidence in the
                        ability of Lord Mountbatten.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>By way of comment on various and sundry reports from Chungking dealing with
                        the subject of apparent Chinese official apathy or indifference in relation
                        to the problem of effort on the part of the Chinese to prepare for and/or to
                        engage in offensive military operations,—I feel that we should take
                        especially into consideration one factor which is of substantial importance
                        and which does not gain mention in reports made by American agencies:
                        namely, that various Chinese in high political and military circles are
                        deeply resentful of the attitudes and methods of some American (and some
                        British) authorities—a fact which may well contribute substantially toward
                        the adoption by such Chinese of the attitudes and positions to which the
                        reporting officers call attention. It is noteworthy also that the Chinese
                        make against their American and their British allies charges not dissimilar
                        to those which various representatives of the said allies, especially some
                        American and some British representatives, make against the Chinese: namely,
                        the charge of uncooperativeness on the part of <pb n="153" xml:id="pg_153" facs="0163"/>various officers and a general tendency to pay too little
                        attention to the China theater and its potentialities. Illustrative in that
                        connection is the mention which Mr. Atcheson made in a conversation, as
                        recorded, with Chinese officials of “the delay in construction of needed
                        airfields and roads and the failure of the Chinese authorities to provide
                        sufficient labor or funds for this work”. True, that delinquency on the part
                        of the Chinese is a fact. However, an identical delinquency on the part of
                        the British in Assam, also a fact, has been complained of both by Chinese
                        and by American authorities.</p>
                    <p>It is quite true that the Chinese are apathetic as regards engaging in or
                        preparing for offensive operations on a substantial scale. Toward overcoming
                        this situation, it is imperative that we and the British give appropriate
                        and adequate attention to the psychological and the material factors which
                        underlie and in large part account for that unsatisfactory phenomenon. So
                        long as the Chinese are doubtful of our intention to treat China as a real
                        partner in a common effort on a fully cooperative basis, and until the
                        Chinese have in their hands weapons in amounts and qualities warranting
                        embarkation by them upon offensive operations, a standstill or sit-down
                        attitude on their part is likely to continue to prevail and complaints about
                        it on our part are likely to have little effect other than that of adversely
                        prejudicing both Chinese opinion and our own opinions. Toward improving this
                        situation, we need especially to make sure of the rightness of our own
                        attitude, intentions and actions in regard to the Far Eastern theater and to
                        our relations with and contacts with China and the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>In the light of these points, consideration of which will, I think,
                        contribute somewhat toward putting the situation under reference in
                        perspective, and in the light of the fact that Lord Mountbatten has been and
                        is—in conference with Chinese and British and American authorities at
                        Chungking and at New Delhi—looking into the situation under reference and
                        its problems, I would recommend that we <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for the
                        present take this matter up with the War Department or any other agency of
                        this Government; or, that if we do take it up with anybody and in any
                        context we make effort to call attention not only to the unsatisfactory
                        features of the Chinese attitude but also and at the same time to factors
                        such as I have mentioned above which play a part in the determining of that
                        attitude and to indicated ways and means resort to which might be expected
                        to contribute toward an advantageous altering of that attitude.<note n="84" xml:id="d117fn84">Notation by Mr. Ballantine: “Concur J. W.

                            very hopeful that the results will be beneficial all around. I am
                            pressing for the full blown partnership of China, Great Britain, Russia
                            and the United States.</p>
                        <p>I am not yet sure whether Stalin can meet me but, under any
                            circumstances, I am anxious to meet you with Churchill at a reasonably
                            early date somewhere between the 20th and the 25th of November. I think
                            Alexandria would be a good meeting place. There are good accommodations
                            there.</p>
                        <p>I will bring a small staff with me including our highest ranking Army,
                            Navy and Air officers. I should think the Conference would last about
                            three days. I know you will not want to be away from China long, but it
                            is far better for me to get away now than later.</p>
                        <p>I am looking forward to seeing you because I am sure there are many
                            things that can only be satisfactorily settled if we can meet face to
                            face. Please keep this very confidential.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Embassy’s telegram no. 1649,
                        September 7, 4 p.m. in regard to the Chinese attitude toward a campaign for
                        the recapture of Burma, I have the honor to enclose a copy of a memorandum
                        on this subject, dated October 20, 1943,<note n="85" xml:id="d119fn85">Not
                            printed.</note> prepared for General Stilwell by Second Secretary of
                        Embassy John S. Service, attached to General Stilwell’s Headquarters.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Chinese public opinion is generally
                            hopeful of an early campaign for the recapture of Burma and the
                            reopening of the Burma Road. The public has been led by Allied
                            propaganda to believe that <pb n="155" xml:id="pg_155" facs="0165"/>such
                            a campaign will be conducted with the coming of the dry season and feels
                            that the success of the campaign will enable China to receive sufficient
                            war supplies for its armed forces and to solve some of its economic
                            problems through the import of needed materials. There will be
                            widespread disappointment among the Chinese people if the campaign does
                            not take place. The press, under strict government control, may be
                            expected to be moderate in its criticism but public resentment, if the
                            Burma drive is abandoned or delayed, is certain to result in an increase
                            in the already existing distrust of Great Britain, which may be
                            directed, to a lesser degree, against the United States. Among higher
                            government circles alone does there seem to be an exception to this
                            attitude. They realize the difficulties of the campaign, the possibility
                            of failure if full British support is not forthcoming, the relatively
                            small amount of supplies which China might expect to receive via a
                            reopened Burma Road and the possible wisdom from the Chinese standpoint
                            of having the war fought around rather than across China, i. e. along
                            the Singapore route. An off-the-record press conference held by Admiral
                            Mountbatten during his recent visit to Chungking, at which Chinese
                            editors and foreign newspapermen were present, gave them the impression
                            that Admiral Mountbatten’s primary interest was in Singapore and that
                            there would be no Burma drive. The Chinese press has, however, so far
                            been only mildly critical of such a strategy. <hi rend="italic">End of

                    </quote>
                    <p>Dr. Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan, in an article recently
                        published in the <hi rend="italic">National Herald</hi>, the local English
                        language daily, voiced the opinion that the opening of the Burma Road would
                        mean little to China in the way of supplies and that the real solution lay
                        in the recapture by Allied forces of a port on the southeast coast of China.
                        This is not the view of the man in the street, however, who feels that the
                        opening of the Burma Road will result in the import of commercial
                        commodities as well as military supplies. Chinese merchants are said to have
                        made large purchases in India with a view to the import of goods over the
                        Burma Road and large quantities of hoarded goods are reported to have been
                        placed on the market in recent months against the arrival of new stocks from
                        India. One Chinese newspaper correspondent has privately stated that even
                        though only military supplies would be allowed to be transported via the
                        Burma Road, the Chinese proclivity for smuggling would ensure the
                        importation of large quantities of commercial products into China by that
                        route. This informant expressed the opinion that there would be deep
                        disappointment among the Chinese people if the Burma campaign were not
                        undertaken and that its effect would be seen in the increasing seriousness
                        of the Chinese economic situation.</p>

                        <p>No. 3734. I have not heard definitely from Marshal Stalin but there is
                            still a chance of Churchill and me meeting him near Persian Gulf.</p>

                            Churchill and me in general neighborhood of Cairo about November

                        <p>Dr. T. V. Soong reports that President would like to meet the
                            Generalissimo and that he would see Stalin either before or after he
                            sees the Generalissimo. The Generalissimo says that now the Peoples
                            Political Council is over, if given reasonable notice he will be glad to
                            meet the President at any time before his meeting with Stalin. If for
                            whatever reason the President cannot see the Generalissimo before his
                            meeting with Stalin the Generalissimo wishes to postpone the meeting
                            until some other time convenient to both parties. He would like the
                            President to advise whether it would be desirable for him to meet with
                            Mr. Churchill and the President together or whether he should see the
                            President alone whenever the meeting takes place.</p>

                    <p>The “Pact of Alliance” which was signed by Japan and the Wang regime on
                        October 30 provides in part that the “treaty” of November 30, 1940<note n="90" xml:id="d123fn90">

                        all instruments annexed thereto” is terminated. A comparison of the texts of
                        the new “pact” and the “treaty” of 1940 suggests that the new “pact”
                        represents a gesture on Japan’s part toward the Wang regime and also
                        possibly toward the U. S. S. R.</p>
                    <p>In comparison with the “treaty”, the “pact” shows a far greater effort on
                        Japan’s part to appeal to Chinese good-will. In the phrasing of the “pact”
                        there is an emphasis on the apparent equality between the two parties, all
                        the commitments being assumed by “Japan and China”. A protocol accompanying
                        the “pact” contains on Japan’s part a commitment to withdraw Japanese forces
                        from China “when general peace between the two countries is restored and a
                        state of war ceases to exist.” Japan also renounces the right of stationing
                        troops under the Boxer Protocol.<note n="91" xml:id="d123fn91">Signed at

                                in China), p. 312</ref>.</note> On the surface these commitments
                        with regard to the withdrawal of Japanese troops go much farther than the
                        commitments contained in the 1940 “treaty”. (The 1940 “treaty” contained
                        provision for the indefinite stationing of Japanese forces in certain parts
                        of China and for the gradual withdrawal of the remainder over a period of
                        two years after the restoration of peace between the two countries.) At the
                        same time the “pact” as a whole is phrased in very general terms and
                        provision is <pb n="158" xml:id="pg_158" facs="0168"/>made that the
                        necessary details for carrying out the “Pact” are to be decided upon
                        subsequently. The door is thus left open for the obtaining by Japan of any
                        concessions which it may desire from “China.”</p>
                    <p>The absence of any mention in the new “pact” of anti-Communism—a subject
                        which held a prominent place in the “treaty” of 1940 and which has long been
                        stressed by Japan as one of the ideological bonds linking Japan and the Wang
                        regime—is notable. This omission may indicate a gesture on Japan’s part
                        toward the U. S. S. R. It certainly shows a determination on Japan’s part
                        not to give offense to the U. S. S. R. at this time.</p>

                        confidential report<note n="92" xml:id="d124fn92">Not printed.</note>
                        written by a Chinese correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>
                        in regard to the military, political and economic phases of the battle in
                        the Lake District of Western Hupeh in May 1943. This report was printed on a
                        single sheet by the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> at Chungking for very
                        limited distribution and none of the material has been published in the
                        paper’s regular edition.</p>
                    <p>The correspondent spent a month and a half in the battle area during June and
                        July where he talked with military personnel, with government officials and
                        with the country people. As a result of his observations, he feels that the
                        battle was a military defeat, a serious economic failure and a grave
                        political defeat.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Although the Chinese military authorities
                            had prior knowledge of the enemy’s retreat, the Chinese
                            counter-offensive did not begin until some days later and in its attacks
                            the Chinese encountered only a small number of enemy rear guard units.
                            Chinese troops engaged in the campaign totaled 20 divisions while the
                            enemy forces were estimated at one and a half divisions or between
                            20,000 to 30,000, two-thirds of which were puppet troops. Chinese losses
                            were approximately 70,000 to 80,000 men while enemy losses were from
                            3,000 to 4,000 men. The Chinese soldiers in this campaign were as well
                            equipped as those of the enemy but the poor physical condition and
                            training of the Chinese troops were largely responsible for the
                            defeat.</p>
                        <p>Causes of Chinese military weakness are said to be: (1) false reports on
                            operations by military commanders of all grades; (2) lack of cooperation
                            among commanding officers; (3) remoteness of high <pb n="159" xml:id="pg_159" facs="0169"/>commanders from their troops; (4)
                            insufficient trained officers; (5) lack of food and medical attention
                            for the soldiers; (6) enmity of the common people toward the Chinese
                            troops; and (7) treachery of Chinese who aid the enemy.</p>
                        <p>Under present conditions, which are believed to exist generally
                            throughout the National Government’s armies, a division of soldiers may
                            be entirely wiped out by disease, starvation and desertions within two
                            years’ time without ever having participated in military operations.</p>
                        <p>Large towns and small villages in the battle area were reduced to ashes
                            and most of the people were killed or taken away by the enemy, who also
                            carried off or destroyed all movable property, broke dikes and burned
                            boats in the area affected. The population was greatly reduced and the
                            destruction effected by the enemy will require twenty to thirty years to
                            repair.</p>
                        <p>The harsh treatment of the common people by the Chinese troops and the
                            Japanese policy of apparent friendliness to them has resulted in making
                            the common people hostile toward their own soldiers. In one town the
                            Chinese garrison, prior to the arrival of the enemy, ordered the local
                            populace to evacuate the city but would not permit them to take their
                            possessions. Following the evacuation the garrison completely looted the
                            city and killed those who had refused to depart. In another place the
                            garrison was guilty of looting, rape, murder and burning of houses and
                            of charging the populace large sums of money for permits to enable them
                            to return to their homes. Local government organizations were in league
                            with the enemy and smugglers and members of secret societies deceived
                            the people into thinking the Japanese would be friendly to them. This
                            was true during the enemy’s advance, but when they retreated they burned
                            villages and killed the people on a vast scale. These same traitors,
                            however, continued to work for the local governmental and party
                            organizations after the campaign. <hi rend="italic">End of

                    <p>The foregoing description of the Hupeh campaign and of the destruction
                        resulting therefrom has been heard from other sources and is believed to be
                        accurate. It represents a damning indictment of the Chinese military
                        authorities responsible for the conditions existing among Chinese troops and
                        gives an indication of the meager extent to which the Chinese armed forces
                        can be expected to contribute to the United Nations war effort unless
                        drastic reorganization takes place. It is not believed that the man in the
                        street is aware of the degree of ineffectiveness of Chinese military
                        strength and many Chinese observers are of the opinion that President Chiang
                        Kai-shek himself is not aware of the extent to which the Chinese army has
                        deteriorated. They state that no one dares tell him the truth and that if
                        anyone did attempt to give him a true picture of the situation those close
                        to the President would prevent such action. It is generally agreed that the
                        higher military authorities are aware of these conditions but are unable
                        effectively to remedy the situation because of economic, financial and
                        political considerations.</p>
                    <pb n="160" xml:id="pg_160" facs="0170"/>
                    <p>Most observers agree that the distressing conditions found among Chinese
                        troops in the Hupeh area are not confined to those forces but generally
                        exist throughout every area. Even the troops of General Hu Tsung-nan, Deputy
                        Commander of the 8th War Zone, which are said to be the best equipped and
                        trained of all the Chinese forces, are reported to require monthly
                        replacements at the rate of 600 men a division. Numerous reports have
                        reached the Embassy of the general ill-health among Chinese troops
                        throughout free China because of lack of sufficient food and medical
                        attention. Many critics state that honest and efficient military
                        administration alone would go far toward solving the problem in that the
                        troops would then receive the food and medical supplies intended for them
                        and the elimination of the present practice of padding the rolls indulged in
                        by military commanders would enable the government to save a considerable
                        sum. There seems, however, little or no hope that any effective steps will
                        be taken by the Chinese authorities to relieve the present situation and the
                        only positive and effective Chinese military contribution will likely come
                        from American-trained and equipped Chinese forces who may be expected to be
                        given decent rations and medical attention.</p>

                        <p>No. 858. Mme Chiang down with flu and dysentery. Funeral of late
                            President Lin Sen scheduled for 17th. Provided Mme Chiang <pb n="161" xml:id="pg_161" facs="0171"/>has recovered I intend to leave here
                            early on the 18th. Otherwise I must delay my departure, in which case
                            your conference with Stalin can take place before ours. I prefer seeing
                            you before you see Stalin and sincerely hope our plans will work out in
                            that way.</p>

                        The despatch contains a summary of the memorandum enclosed therewith.</p>
                    <p>This despatch was prepared, and the investigations upon which it is based
                        were conducted, in response to an instruction from the Embassy sent at the
                        request of General Stilwell’s headquarters. A copy of the report and its
                        enclosure has been transmitted to General Stilwell’s headquarters with the
                        reservations that it must be regarded as secret, that it is not to be used
                        with the Chinese authorities without the consent of the Ambassador, and that
                        in the relations between the American Government and the Chinese
                        authorities, such reports must be used in such manner as not to violate
                        their confidential character, or to disclose their sources, or affect the
                        usefulness and standing of the Foreign Service officers concerned.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            telegram no. 27, dated October 15, 1943, 3 p.m., instructing me to
                            attempt to obtain information in regard to difficulties encountered in
                            the Hengyang area in connection with the construction of airfields, and
                            to enclose herewith a memorandum dated October 26, 1943,<note n="94a" xml:id="d127fn96">Not printed.</note> describing the results of my
                            investigation. In conducting this investigation, I consulted freely with
                            members of the United States armed forces in Changsha, Hengyang and
                            Kweilin, and cautiously and discreetly with Chinese officials, <pb n="162" xml:id="pg_162" facs="0172"/>contractors, and businessmen,
                            and with alien employees of the United States Army at Hengyang. Although
                            some of the information obtained in private interviews might be
                            difficult of confirmation in an official investigation, the general
                            picture is believed to be substantially correct.</p>
                        <p>The following is a summary of the memorandum: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>Construction work on the airfields in the Hengyang area has been
                                    hampered for a variety of reasons: in Hsiangtan, construction is
                                    understood to be delayed because of a lack of funds; in
                                    Kanhsien, primarily because of a technicality but (it is
                                    rumored) fundamentally because of a fear of Japanese reprisals,
                                    work on the airfield has been held up indefinitely; in Namyung
                                    and Suichuan, dilatoriness on the part of representatives of the
                                    Commission on Aeronautical Affairs has jeopardized United States
                                    Army planes; while at Hengyang there seems to be wholesale
                                    intimidation, corruption and venality in connection with
                                    airfield construction in which representatives of the Commission
                                    on Aeronautical Affairs, the War Area Service Corps, and the
                                    Hengyang Municipal Government are involved, resulting in the
                                    cancelation of one large contract and delay in the completion of
                                    several others. One of the chief sources of trouble seems to be
                                    the jealousy of the Commission on Aeronautical Affairs (which
                                    was formerly supreme in matters pertaining to aviation) of the
                                    Ministry of Communications which has taken over most of the
                                    important airfield construction work and of the United States
                                    Army Air Force which has eclipsed the Chinese Air Force. The
                                    Commanding Officer of the United States Army Services of Supply
                                    at Kweilin has recommended that an investigation be made of the
                                    situation in Hengyang by competent Chinese officials.</p>

                    <p>A number of American nationals who have returned from China recently after
                        having been in and around Chungking have affirmed that there is great
                        confusion among and between various American official agencies operating in
                        China, due to the fact that these agencies are operating independently of
                        one another and are responsible only to the different authorities in
                        Washington under which they function respectively. The view has been
                        advanced by some of these observers that the personnel of some of these
                        groups in China seem to be concerned much more for the interests of their
                        own agency than for those of the United States; and the further view has
                        been advanced by some that some system should be devised whereby all of this
                        personnel will be brought under the supervision of some one controlling
                        American authority in Chungking.<note n="97" xml:id="d129fn97">Marginal

                        <p>I have inspected the Chinese Theatre of Operations. I spent considerable
                            time with the American Generals, Lieutenant General Stilwell, Major
                            General Chennault, and other Chinese and American <pb n="164" xml:id="pg_164" facs="0174"/>Army Officers. I was accompanied into
                            the Chinese Theatre by Major General Stratemeyer who is Commander of the
                            American Air Operations in the India and China Theatres. I had two
                            conferences with the President of China, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.
                            The Generalissimo expressed his complete confidence in you, in your
                            motives, and in the principles that you have promulgated.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo talked very frankly about the coming conference in
                            Cairo. He questioned whether or not he could meet Marshal Stalin at
                            Teheran on the terms of amity becoming such a meeting. He related to me
                            frankly the causes that impelled him to hesitate to have a personal
                            meeting with Marshal Stalin. He related to me his suspicions concerning
                            Russia’s desires to communize China and perhaps for complete conquest
                            and annexation to Russia of a portion of China.</p>
                        <p>I recalled to him Marshal Stalin’s renunciation of world conquest as a
                            fundamental policy of communism. I told him that in my opinion Marshal
                            Stalin is now committed to the proposition that communism can succeed in
                            Russia alone without an attempt being made to force it on the rest of
                            the world. I said also that in my opinion Russia is no longer
                            subsidizing or directing communist activities in other nations. I
                            suggested to the Generalissimo that Russia’s own experience with
                            communism in Russia is to some extent neutralizing what we considered to
                            be the harsher elements of the communistic ideology. I said that I
                            realized that there are communist political parties in other nations but
                            in my opinion such parties are neither directed nor subsidized from
                            Russia.</p>
                        <p>In corroboration of these arguments I drew the Generalissimo’s attention
                            to the recent Moscow declaration. Notwithstanding this, the
                            Generalissimo still appeared to entertain grave doubts of the friendly
                            intentions of the Soviet Government toward China.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo stated that he wished to see you first in Cairo and
                            much depended on his conference with you as to whether or not he would
                            subsequently confer with Marshal Stalin.</p>
                        <p>I hope I may have the opportunity of discussing with you the
                            Chinese-Russian problem before you have a conference with the
                            Generalissimo.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo stated that so far as you and Prime Minister Churchill
                            are concerned he has no doubt of being able to find a basis of complete
                            cooperation.</p>
                        <p>As President of China and as Generalissimo, Chiang Kai-shek will
                            recommend that the coming conference reiterate the Atlantic
                                Charter.<note n="98" xml:id="d131fn98">Joint declaration by

                                <label>(1)</label>
                                <item>The Generalissimo and the Chinese people favor the principles
                                    of democracy and liberty.</item>
                                <label>(2)</label>
                                <item>The Generalissimo and the Chinese people are opposed to the
                                    principles of imperialism and communism.</item>
                                <label>(3)</label>
                                <item>He believes that you, of course, favor democracy and liberty.
                                    He understands, however, that you may temporarily have to
                                    temporize with imperialism and communism in the interests of the
                                    joint war effort.</item>
                                <label>(4)</label>
                                <item>He is aware that the future co-operation and unity of the
                                    United Nations must depend upon your ability to assimilate
                                    rather than eliminate divergent ideologies. He is convinced that
                                    you must find principles on which the Big Four nations can
                                    agree. In seeking these principles he feels that you must have
                                    extensive freedom of action.</item>
                                <label>(5)</label>
                                <item>He wanted me to say to you that he has implicit confidence in
                                    your motives and that he is committed to the fundamental
                                    principles which you have promulgated.</item>
                                <label>(6)</label>
                                <item>He will, therefore, follow your leadership on the diplomatic
                                    and political questions that will be considered in the impending
                                    conference.</item>
                            </list>
               </p>
                        <p>On strategy he finds himself unable to accept a subordinate position in
                            the Asiatic area to Lord Mountbatten. He stated that so far as the
                            Chinese Theatre of Operations is concerned he must be supreme. He stated
                            that if he should accept a secondary position in that theatre it would
                            divide his following and eventually so weaken his position that he could
                            no longer maintain himself as the leader of all China. Notwithstanding
                            this attitude he is ready to cooperate fully with Lord Mountbatten and
                            he thinks that in Northern Burma and eventually in Thailand and possibly
                            in Indo-China, there would be circumstances in which he would favor the
                            control of British, American and Chinese troops being placed under one
                            commander. He said that he personally liked Lord Mountbatten and that he
                            could visualize future operations outside of China where he would want
                            his Lordship to be the Supreme Commander of United Nations forces,
                            including Chinese Armies. However, he was steadfast in maintenance of
                            the principle that in the Chinese Theatre it is better for himself and
                            China and the United Nations that he should remain the ultimate
                            authority.</p>
                        <p>He expressed the opinion that the subjugation of Japan should be sought
                            through an attack on Japan in Japan. Attacks should be made from various
                            sectors of the Pacific Theatre, the India-Burmese and the Chinese
                            Theatres simultaneously. These attacks should be coordinated <pb n="166" xml:id="pg_166" facs="0176"/>and directed toward the ultimate
                            occupation and conquest of Japan in Japan. Tokio and all Japan is the
                            objective rather than any state, island or citadel outside of Japan. He
                            also spoke with clarity of the strategy of attacking Tokio and all Japan
                            through China.</p>
                        <p>In all of the foregoing it will be apparent to you that I have confined
                            myself to a discussion of the attitude of President-Generalissimo Chiang
                            Kai-shek toward a meeting with Marshal Stalin.<note n="98b" xml:id="d131fn104">In a message to President Roosevelt dated
                                November 12, 1943, Marshal Stalin stated: “It goes without saying
                                that at Tehran there will take place a meeting of the heads of only
                                the three Governments as was agreed. The participation of the
                                representatives of any other powers must be absolutely excluded.”
                                (Moscow Embassy Files, Lot F–96.)</note> I have purposely refrained
                            from injecting into this letter any of the reasons why Marshal Stalin
                            might not want a public meeting with Chiang Kai-shek at this moment. For
                            instance, Marshal Stalin might be opposed to taking any action that
                            might cause the closing of the Port of Vladivostok. Moreover, you may
                            find that Marshal Stalin might be convinced that it would be unwise to
                            take any action that might bring an enemy down on his rear in the
                            present posture of the conflict.</p>
                        <p>In evaluating the Generalissimo’s conversations it is advisable to
                            consider with some skepticism the Chinese capacity, or readiness, to
                            contribute materially to offensive warfare. It is advisable likewise to
                            give consideration to the relative importance placed by the Chinese
                            Central Government upon conserving its strength for maintenance of its
                            postwar internal supremacy as against the more immediate objective of
                            defeating Japan. These are questions I should like to discuss with you
                            further.</p>

                    <p>All of the above listed representatives have been designated “Special

                        will be attacked in immediate future with little possibility of other than
                        usual perfunctory defense; that it is reliably reported that larger
                        proportion Jap troops to puppets are being employed than in last campaign;
                        that in Kwangtung Japs have occupied Canton–Kowloon railway area and are
                        threatening Waichow; that if Changsha falls it is considered likely Japs

                        meet effective Chinese resistance; and that if that line is occupied
                        Americans east of it will be isolated.</p>

                            <p>The Minister of Economic Affairs, Dr. Wong Wen-hao, one of the
                                soundest and more competent of the higher officials of the Chinese
                                Government, informed us not long ago that he could envisage no
                                solution for the problem of inflation in this country, and he
                                mentioned that even the tax system, especially collection in kind,
                                had proven disappointing because of corruption on the part of the
                                poorly paid tax officials. He said that the people found it
                                unbearable, as evidenced by the resultant peasant revolts against it
                                in a number of provinces of free China.</p>
                            <p>It must be accepted as fact that the Chinese cannot solve their
                                desperate economic problems. China not only lacks the administrative
                                machinery to enforce price, anti-hoarding and other
                                anti-inflationary controls, but Chinese officials, merchants and the
                                people in general do not have the psychological make-up under
                                present conditions which is necessary for effective cooperation for
                                success in such matters.</p>
                        <p>2. The military and political implications in this situation are
                                obvious and have lately become more and more apparent. Corollary to
                                the economic deterioration there has been a steady military
                                deterioration with the result that China’s war effort the past four
                                years has been completely defensive and in many respects has become
                                very passively and complacently so. The Chinese have more and more
                                developed the tendency to rely, for the protection and maintenance
                                of free China, less upon their armies than upon geographic factors
                                and the reluctance of the Japanese to expend enough men and
                                materials to drive the Chinese Government from Chungking. (The U. S.
                                14th Air Force has been the weapon, by its attacks upon enemy air
                                strength, including installations, which has forced the Japanese air
                                arm to concentrate on counterattacks on “allied” airfields and to
                                refrain from costly efforts to bomb the Chinese Government out of
                                Chungking.) We have mentioned in previous reports the serious and
                                widespread deterioration of the Chinese troops due to malnutrition,
                                lack of militarily useful activity, corruption of officers, and the
                                participation by troops in trade with the enemy and enemy-held
                                territory <pb n="170" xml:id="pg_170" facs="0180"/>for subsistence
                                purposes and sometimes for profit; we have reported the weakening of
                                the Government’s internal position and the serious effects which the
                                situation is having upon prospects for postwar political and
                                economic reconstruction.</p>
                            <p>Serious as are the political implications in the situation, it would
                                be a mistake to assume that the inevitable result will be compromise
                                with Japan. Chiang Kai-shek and his supporters who control the
                                Government have no thought of capitulation, or of endeavoring to
                                work out any <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> with Japan as long
                                as they can keep going. They learned long ago in north China in the
                                bitterest way what “cooperation” with the Japanese means and since
                                have had more than ample evidence in the occupied areas of China and
                                of other Far Eastern countries of what might be expected from coming
                                to terms with Japan. A compromise arrangement with the Japanese
                                would hold no benefit to the leaders of a Government whose soundest
                                store of value is in its funds and foreign exchange credits in the
                                United States and who realize the necessity of being on the winning
                                side. There is no question that China’s leaders and the Chinese as a
                                whole have during the past year acquired a conviction that the
                                Allies will win the war. Indeed, the optimism and wishful thinking
                                of the Chinese in respect to an early termination of the war,
                                including an early collapse of Japan, have made them all the more
                                vulnerable psychologically to reverses; and this provides one of the
                                reasons why failure of a Burma campaign would have most serious
                                effects upon Chinese morale. By hastening the process of the already
                                continuing economic, military and political deterioration, it would
                                without much question tend to diminish at an accelerated pace
                                China’s war effort and reduce the amount of active help which the
                                Chinese Government could furnish to our military and other
                                governmental agencies concerned in the general war effort in this
                                theatre.</p>
                        <p>3. The question of what further the American Government can do toward
                                causing improvement in this situation remains ever before us and
                                becomes increasingly urgent as time goes on.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the problem of assisting an Ally who has suffered at
                                the hands of the enemy for six years and who continues to contain
                                almost half a million Japanese troops with their equipment including
                                a large number of planes, our pressing immediate problems are
                                twofold: (1) to increase our aid to China so that if she can be
                                persuaded to do so she may in time take an active rather than a
                                passive—an offensive rather than a weak defensive—role in the war
                                against Japan; and (2) to induce the Chinese to make such actively
                                affirmative contribution to the war effort <hi rend="italic">now</hi> as is in their capacity—and there is much they can do
                                at present to help the Allied cause which they are not by any means
                                doing. (There is another long range problem <pb n="171" xml:id="pg_171" facs="0181"/>which need not be considered
                                here—that of diverting the Chinese Government from its fascist-like
                                tendencies, both political and economic, into the direction of
                                democracy so that it will be easy and natural for China to cooperate
                                with us, economically as well as politically, after the
                            war.)</p>
                        <p>4. Unfortunately, due in part to China’s inability to help herself
                            economically, there appears to be little effective economic help we can
                            furnish China at the present time and under present conditions. Foreign
                            loans appear to have lost effective value as a palliative for the
                            constantly deteriorating economic situation. The American Stabilization
                            Loan has not been actually used and the Stabilization Board (which since
                            the outbreak of the Pacific War has more and more become an
                            instrumentality of the Chinese Ministry of Finance rather than a free
                            agent and which is now moribund) has not stabilized the currency. While
                            the official rate as against U. S. currency is 20 to 1, American dollars
                            sell in black markets at from 80–100 to 1, and the only “stabilization”
                            that has been effected has been in the restricted field of international
                            remittances. The American half-billion dollar credit, although it gave
                            great encouragement to the Chinese Government at the time it was
                            arranged and consequently helped to sustain confidence in the
                            Government’s capacity to carry on, has had little or no other effect on
                            China’s internal economy, has not retarded inflation, and has been
                            economically useful to the Chinese Government chiefly because it has
                            provided a means of building up the Chinese Government’s foreign
                            exchange reserves abroad. (There is reason to believe that the Chinese
                            Government has been eager to use up the half-billion dollar credit to
                            clear the decks for a request for a further American loan.) The project
                            for the sale of gold—the most recent Chinese device to utilize the
                            American loan—may be abandoned by the Chinese Government as far as its
                            original purpose is concerned and the gold may be used as a reserve in
                            connection with post-war international monetary arrangements. Even if
                            the gold should be utilized for the originally announced purpose, it is
                            not expected that its sale in free China will, as against the continuing
                            excessive rate of currency expansion, so reduce note circulation as to
                            retard inflation to any appreciable degree.</p>
                        <p>5. Politically, it is believed that the American Government has been
                                doing everything possible to assist China. Mere political gestures
                                have, like loans, lost effective value. But concrete gestures such
                                as the inclusion of China in the recent Moscow Declaration have
                                obvious immediate as well as long range value and tend to strengthen
                                and make more solid China’s community of interest with us and her
                                other principal ally in international affairs. Such developments
                                hold, of course, a very considerable appeal to the Chinese,
                                especially because <pb n="172" xml:id="pg_172" facs="0182"/>of the
                                implications that China is one of the “Big Four” and is a
                                first-class power and because considerations of face so extensively
                                govern Chinese thought and action.</p>
                            <p>But such developments do not influence China much, if at all, toward
                                acting like a first-class power in respect to her obligations to her
                                Allies. This is not entirely due to cynical selfishness and
                                self-interest. It is due in part to war weariness and to the Chinese
                                conviction, which we and our propagandists both official and
                                unofficial have helped the Chinese to acquire, that they have
                                already done their part and may well sit back, conserving what they
                                have of treasure and materials and men and obtaining from us more
                                treasure and materials if they can, while we defeat Japan and bring
                                into being the rosy postwar China on which they are now
                                concentrating so much wishful thinking.</p>
                            <p>Mixed with this wishful thinking are some definite apprehensions for
                                the future which gnaw on the official Chinese mind as justification
                                for conservation of military resources and for diverting more than
                                half a million soldiers (including some of the best Chinese
                                divisions) from the Japanese front to blockade the Chinese communist
                                forces. The Chinese are apprehensive lest in time the Russians sweep
                                down through Manchuria and with the aid of the Chinese communists
                                occupy north China as well as Manchuria. They suspect that the
                                British do not wish Burma recaptured with the assistance of China
                                and the United States; that the British may occupy Thailand and stay
                                there; and that once Malaya is retaken from the Japanese, British
                                effort toward crushing Japan will dwindle. They suspect that by the
                                time this happens the United States itself may be so war weary that
                                we may make a compromise peace with Japan. There is a definite
                                relationship between these apprehensions and the question of the
                                Chinese willingness, aside from the question of capacity, to
                                revitalize China’s war effort.</p>
                        <p>6. We cannot expect China to increase her contribution to the war
                                effort beyond her capacity, or even up to a point near the limit of
                                her capacity. The yardstick of China’s great manpower as a mighty
                                military potential, so frequently used by commentators and “experts”
                                in the United States and elsewhere to measure China’s value to the
                                Allied cause, is a false gauge. Without artillery, without adequate
                                supplies and reserves of munitions and equipment and other
                                essentials, without intensive training of troops, efficient
                                leadership and vastly improved morale, it is fantastic to expect
                                China to undertake any serious offensive against the Japanese, now
                                or in the long future. China simply does not have the capacity, or
                                the spirit, to do so.</p>
                            <p>But there is much that China can do, and is not doing, to assist in
                                the defeat of Japan. China can and should contribute to her ally,
                                the <pb n="173" xml:id="pg_173" facs="0183"/>United States, a
                                larger, more realistic and wholehearted cooperation and assistance
                                in the measures taken by the United States to aid China in the China
                                theater; to protect China from Japan and to reach forward to the
                                vitals of Japan—to strike at Japan’s war industries, and bases, and
                                shipping and naval strength and air and military strength in China,
                                in the areas near China, and in Japan, for the purpose of crippling
                                and destroying them by air power.</p>
                            <p>China has long cried loudly for greater air aid—for planes for an
                                almost nonexistent Chinese air force, and for American air support.
                                But the expansion of aerial activity in China and its extension to
                                the vitals of Japan depends not alone on the provision of planes and
                                pilots but on the necessary facilities for the use and support of
                                those planes and pilots; it depends upon the provision of numerous
                                adequate air bases with all the facilities needed at such bases for
                                efficient air operations; it depends on roads connecting airfields
                                with bases of supply; it depends on transport for constant and
                                continuing supply, and so on. It depends also upon military
                                dispositions by the Chinese ground forces to cover the extension of
                                the line of bases eastward, ever forward, to within striking
                                distance of Japan and Formosa and neighboring areas. It depends upon
                                proper and adequate military dispositions by Chinese ground forces
                                to cooperate with the air forces themselves in protecting such bases
                                against the inevitable Japanese expeditions for their
                                destruction.</p>
                            <p>It is such aid and assistance that China can give, and give in
                                abundant measure, to assist her allies, and by assisting them, to
                                help herself in the winning of the war. It is such aid and
                                assistance that China is not giving, or is giving only
                                half-heartedly or in meagre measure.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese—some of them sincerely but lacking knowledge of the real
                                situation—may dispute that charge; but the facts remain that China’s
                                aid has been found sadly wanting; that there are long, unexplained
                                delays in getting on with the construction of air bases and air base
                                facilities and roads; that budgets are cut and only restored after
                                pressure; that appropriated funds are long delayed in being issued
                                from the Chinese treasury and work is constantly postponed until
                                funds are available; that there is evidence of graft and corruption
                                and even of sabotage of honest effort; that costs are fantastically
                                high for both labor and materials and there is no disposition to
                                check them; that, while the American Government itself is
                                contributing enormous sums for the provision of the necessary air
                                base facilities, for transportation costs, et cetera, exchange rates
                                are being held at a ridiculous and arbitrary level—with no real
                                disposition to effect an honest adjustment, or to provide reverse
                                lend-lease or mutual aid; that troops which might be used to protect
                                the eastward movement <pb n="174" xml:id="pg_174" facs="0184"/>of
                                our line of attack on Japan from the air—to protect air base
                                construction and to defend the bases when constructed—are stationed
                                elsewhere to blockade Chinese communist areas or to prepare for
                                civil war in China after the defeat of Japan; and that there is also
                                evidence that under threats by the Japanese of bombing operations in
                                localities where airfields may be constructed, local authorities
                                have impeded—practically sabotaged—the plans for such projects.</p>
                            <p>Be as charitable as one may, it cannot be said that China is
                                contributing in any reasonable measure, within her resources, to the
                                war effort in the China theater; China is not helping her Allies to
                                help herself.</p>
                        <p>7. After some six years of war the Chinese are undoubtedly tired and
                                war weary. While they have no thought of capitulating or of seeking
                                an arrangement with Japan, they have more or less persuaded
                                themselves that they have done their full part in this war and their
                                inclination is to sit back, conserve their resources, and let us win
                                the war for them. We are ourselves greatly to blame for having
                                allowed China to slip into this state of complacency. Our propaganda
                                at home has helped the Chinese to persuade themselves that they have
                                done their full share in the war.</p>
                            <p>China is dependent upon the friendship and generosity of the United
                                States not only during the war but in the post-war reconstruction
                                period. Her leaders fully realize this but are too inclined to take
                                American aid—military, financial, and political—as a matter of
                                course; almost as a matter of right.</p>
                            <p>By a more realistic—but frank, honest and open—attitude and approach
                                it should be possible for us to persuade China to abandon her
                                lethargic complacency and revitalize her war effort within the
                                available means and resources of the country and in a more
                                cooperative and responsible and appreciative attitude toward her
                                American ally, which alone is assisting her in her distress.</p>
                            <p>Our aid to China by way of the provision of military and other
                                supplies must continue to be limited until land or sea supply routes
                                can be re-established. Reopening of the Burma Road would not, of
                                course, result in an immediate influx of consumers goods, because
                                its capacity would be taxed with the transport of military supplies
                                needed to expand our military activities and to equip the Chinese
                                for any possible expansion of theirs. But it would result in a
                                tremendous upswing in morale which would have a very salutary effect
                                on the general economic situation because it would cause a rebirth
                                of confidence in the currency and would force the release of hoarded
                                goods.</p>
                        <p>8. As present circumstances limit us to the military (principally the
                                aerial) field in aiding China, it is to military developments within
                                China and in adjacent areas that we must look for possible sources
                                of <pb n="175" xml:id="pg_175" facs="0185"/>improvement in the
                                unhappy economic situation. Meanwhile, barring crop failures, that
                                situation will continue as it is, worsening steadily toward some
                                time and point at which the present almost fixed rate of
                                deterioration will break into chaos. Fortunately that time and point
                                is yet some distance away.</p>
                            <p>Mention was made in despatch no. 1529 that economic and financial
                                experts in China seem to agree that inflation of itself
                                (notwithstanding the fantastic rate of the spiraling) will not
                                result in economic collapse in the near future because China is
                                fundamentally an agricultural country and the great majority of the
                                population live off the land. Dr. Young,<note n="4" xml:id="d135fn4">Arthur N. Young.</note> American adviser to the Chinese
                                Ministry of Finance, was cited as of the opinion that the
                                determining factors in the situation for the future were the extent
                                of the Chinese Government’s growing deficit; the state of public
                                confidence, which largely depends upon the military situation
                                especially in China and in areas adjoining China; and the state of
                                the crops.</p>
                            <p>In despatch no. 1564, we reaffirmed our opinion that the agricultural
                                considerations mentioned above preclude the probability of the
                                occurrence of a general economic collapse in the same time ratio as
                                that of the collapse in Austria in the years 1921–23 following a
                                somewhat parallel seven year period of inflation, and that the
                                question of the maintenance of the economic situation against wholly
                                disastrous deterioration resolves itself into military problems. We
                                pointed out that acceleration of American victories in the Pacific
                                would improve Chinese morale and therefore benefit Chinese economy
                                and finance (the Chinese, notwithstanding their own lack of
                                affirmative war effort, are very articulate in their complaints
                                against the slowness of the “stepping-stone campaign” in the South
                                Pacific islands). The view was expressed that early recapture of
                                Burma would result in a great lift in confidence, which would have
                                extremely beneficial results on the economic situation in general.
                                (It was also pointed out, as has been done in other despatches and
                                telegraphic reports, that failure of a Burma campaign would be a
                                disaster of the first magnitude.) We gave our considered opinion
                                that the determining factors were and would continue to be those
                                comprised in military developments within China and in adjoining
                                areas.</p>
                            <p>Dr. Wong Wen-hao has stated to us that he believes it is impossible
                                to make any definitive prediction as to how long the present
                                disheartening financial and economic situation can continue but that
                                in his opinion a major economic crisis does not seem likely to occur
                                within a year or a year and a half. Mr. Adler, in connection with
                                his summary of the adverse factors in the situation described in
                                paragraph numbered one of this despatch, has commented that,
                                notwithstanding <pb n="176" xml:id="pg_176" facs="0186"/>the famine
                                conditions in some areas and the failure of a second crop in Honan
                                Province, the 1943 harvest has been on the whole satisfactory and
                                that the Chinese Government should be able to supply the Chinese
                                forces with sufficient food to last during the coming year. Mr.
                                Adler considers that, other factors being more or less constant,
                                there is no danger of imminent collapse so long as the food supply
                                continues to be maintained and he believes, as does the Embassy,
                                that the chief hope for economic improvement in free China rests in
                                an early and successful Allied campaign against Burma.</p>
                        <p>9. While some of the highest officials are complacent in regard to the
                            question of a Burma campaign, the general feeling is that the Burma Road
                            is China’s life-line and must be reopened soon. In the absence of such
                            campaign—or in the absence of a comparable substitute such as the
                            occupation of Indochina or of a south China port—the situation may be
                            expected to continue to develop adversely along its present course,
                            giving us a leeway of perhaps a year or a little longer before a serious
                            crisis occurs. Meanwhile our present aid to China will continue to help
                            maintain the situation, especially if the Chinese can be persuaded to
                            help themselves by helping us in the ways that are open to them to do
                            so. This can be accomplished by making it clear to the Chinese, as we
                            continue to help them with the 14th Air Force and with lend-lease
                            materials, that we expect them to do their part, within their
                            capacities, actively and affirmatively to further the common
                            cause.</p>

                    <p>2322. President and Madame Chiang Kai-shek conferred in Cairo with President
                        Roosevelt and Churchill last week of the month. The resulting tripartite
                        declaration was considered by Chinese a great diplomatic victory for China
                        as (1) constituting a promise by the United States of America and Britain to
                        effect return to China of territories taken from her by Japan; (2) ensuring
                        Manchuria against feared future encroachment by Soviet Russia; and (3)
                        entailing no additional commitments [of] service on China’s part other than
                        that related to the unconditional surrender of Japan. [Here follows summary

                        <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. President</hi>: The Generalissimo and I
                            arrived in Chungking on the morning of December 1st. On our way we
                            inspected <pb n="179" xml:id="pg_179" facs="0189"/>the training of the
                            Composite Wing in Karachi. We also stopped at Ramgarh for the day to
                            inspect the troops and to attend the practice of tanks and artillery and
                            finally, late that night, we stopped at Chabau where we had a conference
                            with the generals commanding the forces at the Ledo front. Admiral
                            Mountbatten met us at Ranchi and accompanied us to the Ramgarh
                            manoeuvers. You will be glad to know that the Generalissimo was
                            delighted with the training and spoke to the troops exhorting them to
                            give their best in the coming Burma campaign.</p>
                        <p>Since our homecoming the Cairo communiqué has been published. Its effect
                            of uplifting the morale of our army and the people has been electric; in
                            fact the entire nation is articulate to a degree that has never been
                            known before in unanimously hailing the conference as a sure sign-post
                            leading the Far East towards post-war peace. The leadership which you so
                            eminently displayed and the magnificent spirit permeating all that you
                            are undertaking for the good of humanity are subjects of conversation
                            amongst all Chinese circles. The consensus of opinion is that “President
                            Roosevelt is a great man and he does things in a truly great
                            spirit.”</p>
                        <p>Immediately upon our return the Generalissimo consulted with Dr. Kung
                            regarding the feasibility of the plan which you suggested in our
                            conference regarding the alleviation of China’s urgent economic
                            situation. Dr. Kung has studied its possibilities with great care and he
                            wishes me to tell you that, in his opinion, your suggestion is both
                            generous and kind and he thinks some feasible procedure could be worked
                            out with the aid of Secretary Morgenthau. He appreciates the interest
                            and concern you have shown in helping us to fight aggression not only
                            with the military machine, but with economic weapons as well. He is
                            impressed with the fact that you see with such clear foresight and
                            vision that, in order to continue resistance, methods and means must be
                            evolved to hold intact China’s economic security, a fact which you
                            doubtless will remember that the Generalissimo emphasized was even more
                            critical than the military.</p>
                        <p>The Generalissimo is now thinking of asking Dr. Kung or his appointee,
                            empowered with full credentials, to go to Washington to discuss the
                            details with the American Government and would like to know whether this
                            is satisfactory to you. It would, of course, be best if Dr. Kung could
                            go himself, but, failing that, he will send one of his trusted men to go
                            in his stead.</p>
                        <p>I need not tell you how grateful we feel that you have promised to speak
                            to the Treasury about the two hundred million gold bar arrangement.</p>
                        <pb n="180" xml:id="pg_180" facs="0190"/>
                        <p>The Generalissimo wishes me to thank you again for your promise to help

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have the honor to inform
                        you that I have just received the following message, dated December 7, 1943,
                        addressed by the Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of
                        China to the President of the United States of America: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I find it difficult to express the great pleasure I felt in meeting
                                you. Madame Chiang was particularly delighted to see you again
                                shortly following the memorable visit to your country.</p>
                            <p>“Our recent conference in the neighborhood of Cairo is momentous and
                                historic. The official communiqué is hailed by the Chinese army and
                                people, just as it is hailed elsewhere. In heralding a sure and
                                complete victory, the conference crystalized as never before our war
                                aims in the Far East. It vindicated the full cooperation and firm
                                solidarity of the United Nations. While giving renewed impetus to
                                every soldier and civilian on our side, it sealed the fate of Japan,
                                our ruthless common enemy. It has in fact laid the corner stone of a
                                just and lasting peace after the unconditional surrender of the Axis
                                powers. Because of your high ideal of justice, the conference proved
                                a success which will, I am certain, have favorable repercussions in
                                the world military situation.</p>
                            <p>“May I express to you my deep appreciation for the noble spirit and
                                broad vision you have consistently shown in dealing with world
                                problems particularly for the unfailing assistance you have
                                repeatedly rendered to China.</p>
                            <p>“Madame Chiang joins me in sending you our heartiest greetings and

                        <p>I have received your telegram of December 6th [<hi rend="italic">5th</hi>]. Upon my return I asked Madame Chiang to inform you of the
                            gratifying effect <pb n="181" xml:id="pg_181" facs="0191"/>the
                            communiqué of the Cairo conference has had on the Chinese Army and
                            people in uplifting their morale to continue active resistance against
                            Japan. This letter is on the way and is being brought to you by the
                            Pilot Captain Shelton.</p>
                        <p>First: Prior to the Cairo conference there had been disturbing elements
                            voicing their discontent and uncertainty of America and Great Britain’s
                            attitude in waging a global war and at the same time leaving China to
                            shift as best she could against our common enemy. At one stroke the
                            Cairo communiqué decisively swept away this suspicion in that we three
                            had jointly and publicly pledged to launch a joint all-out offensive in
                            the Pacific.</p>
                        <p>Second: If it should now be known to the Chinese Army and people that a
                            radical change of policy and strategy is being contemplated, the
                            repercussions would be so disheartening that I fear of the consequences
                            of China’s ability to hold out much longer.</p>
                        <p>Third: I am aware and appreciate your being influenced by the probable
                            tremendous advantages to be reaped by China as well as by the United
                            Nations as a whole in speedily defeating Germany first. For the victory
                            of one theater of war necessarily affects all other theaters; on the
                            other hand, the collapse of the China theater would have equally grave
                            consequences on the global war. I have, therefore come to this
                            conclusion that in order to save this grave situation, I am inclined to
                            accept your recommendation. You will doubtless realize that in so doing
                            my task in rallying the nation to continue resistance is being made
                            infinitely more difficult: <list>

                                <item>Because the danger to the China theater lies not only in the
                                    inferiority of our military strength, but also, and more
                                    especially, in our critical economic condition which may
                                    seriously affect the morale of the army and people, and cause at
                                    any moment a sudden collapse of the entire front. Judging from
                                    the present critical situation, military as well as economic, it
                                    would be impossible for us to hold on for 6 months, and <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> to wait till November 1944. In
                                    my last conversation with you, I stated that China’s economic
                                    situation was more critical than the military. The only seeming
                                    solution is to assure the Chinese people and army of your
                                    sincere concern in the China theater of war by assisting China
                                    to hold on with a billion gold dollar loan to strengthen her
                                    economic front and relieve her dire economic needs.
                                    Simultaneously, in order to prove our resolute determination to
                                    bring relentless pressure on Japan, the Chinese Air Force and
                                    the American Air Force stationed in China should be increased,
                                    as from next spring, by at least double the number of aircraft
                                    already agreed upon, and the total of air transportation should
                                    be increased, as from February of next year, to at least 20,000
                                    tons a month to make effective the operation of the additional

                                <item>In this way might be possible to bring relief to our economic

                                    the entire weight of the United Nations forces will be applied
                                    to the European front thus abandoning the China theater to the
                                    mercy of Japan’s mechanized air and land forces. It would be

                    <p>Peffer’s article is restrained in tone and is in fact a plea for a balanced
                        view and for the exercise of forbearance in discussions of American-Chinese
                        relations. In achieving this balance the author has spoken frankly, but the
                        Department does not consider that the article is unfair to China or
                        overdrawn, although certain passages, especially the references to Madame

                            review is very thorough and competent and he seems to have made good use
                            of the materials at his disposal.</p>
                        <p>There is attached a list of suggested amendments and alterations.<note n="16" xml:id="d146fn1">Not printed.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>I submit the following by way of comment to bring the information in the
                            review up to date:</p>
                        <p>Conditions have continued approximately as outlined in the review, with a
                            steady deterioration in the physical condition of industrial and
                            transport equipment, and a rapid increase in the volume of currency
                            circulation, which is irregularly, but inevitably reflected in the price
                            structure.</p>
                        <p>On the brighter side of the picture are the fairly good crops recently
                            harvested, which ensure against a food shortage in most areas (with some
                            unfortunate exceptions), and continued reports of United <pb n="185" xml:id="pg_185" facs="0195"/>Nations successes in Europe and the
                            South Pacific. These reports bolster morale and encourage the hope that
                            the end of the blockade of China may not be much longer deferred. It is
                            not probable that China’s loosely integrated economic structure will
                            crack for some time unless there should be a bad crop failure, when the
                            situation might become acute.</p>
                        <p>The only measure which might reasonably be expected to check the rapid
                            spiraling of prices would be a successful campaign in Burma promising
                            the opening of the Burma Road. While with the reopening of that artery
                            of land communications it would for a long period of time be necessary
                            to restrict traffic to the transport of military supplies and equipment,
                            and only limited quantities—if any—of commercial goods could be brought
                            into China, the fact that land communication with outside sources of
                            supply had been re-established, with promise of early victory over
                            Japan, would lead to the release of hoarded stocks and generally ease
                            the economic position in the country as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The Government of China has been making some attempt to reduce the rate
                            of inflation by reducing railroad and other construction; but these
                            budegtary savings have been negligible as compared with the inevitably
                            increasing costs resulting from mounting commodity prices. At the end of
                            October, for example, it was found necessary by the Government to
                            quadruple government salaries and double cost of living allowances. The
                            only apparent effect of the reduction in construction activities has
                            been a decrease in the demand for steel and cement.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Proposed assistance of American
                                production experts</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Government officials consulted have indicated that the assistance of
                            American production experts would be welcomed but it was evident that
                            they were thinking mainly of post-war reconstruction rather than an
                            increase in war-time output. The need for a chemical engineer was
                            mentioned and it is possible that such an engineer might be of immediate
                            value in improving the production of fuel alcohol from sugar. (Under the
                            present system, it takes 11 kilos of brown sugar or 15 kilos of molasses
                            to produce one gallon of 96 percent alcohol.) Miming is said to be
                            notably inefficient but an American mining engineer (Mr. Marshall Morris
                            of the FEA) does not believe that an American mining engineer could do
                            much to improve the situation, because of political difficulties. There
                            seems to be much room for improvement in the transportation situation
                            and an American expert, if given a competent staff and a free hand,
                            could probably do much to improve it through more efficient use of
                            available facilities and through possible ability to obtain the most
                            vitally needed imports. To be effective, however, he would have to be
                            free of political interference and in a position to <pb n="186" xml:id="pg_186" facs="0196"/>act ruthlessly, and it is unlikely that
                            an American expert would be permitted to exercise the necessary powers,
                            even if they were initially granted to him.<note n="*" xml:id="d146fn21">Technical personnel provided by the FEA is now in China, assisting

                            goes farther in suggesting the utility of a man of great prestige and
                            broad caliber, familiar with all aspects of industry, including finance,
                            production, transportation and distribution, who could integrate the
                            conflicting policies of the different ministries and bureaus. It seems
                            extremely improbable, however, that such an economic dictator would be
                            accepted or permitted to function.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of very competent Chinese mechanical engineers, who
                            are doing reasonably well with the facilities available. It is possible
                            that American production engineers, accustomed to modern equipment and
                            to the availability of stores of supplies, would be less adept than the
                            Chinese at the improvisation required to keep factories going in the
                            difficult circumstances encountered in China. American engineers now in
                            China are generally agreed that production experts from the United
                            States, with the facilities available, could do little to increase
                            production or even to prevent a decline in production, as machinery
                            continues to deteriorate and transportation and the financial situation
                            get steadily worse. In The post-war reconstruction, there will be a very
                            great need for American production experts, including both graduate
                            engineers and factory superintendents and shop foremen.</p>

                        practices on the part of businessmen in Kwangsi in their business relations
                        with the United States Army Services of Supply in Kweilin and other centers

                        10, 1943, this committee remained moribund until December, 1943, when it was
                        revived at the insistence of General Pai Chung-hsi, who had originally
                        suggested to Chairman Huang that such a body should be created. As a result
                        of discreet comments on the subject of corrupt practices here which were
                        made by the commanding officer of the Services of Supply in this area to
                        representatives of the local press at an off-the-record,
                        background-information press conference on December 15, 1943, the provincial
                        chairman received identical telegrams dated December 18, 1943, from
                        President Chiang Kai-shek and Minister of War Ho Ying-ch’in demanding
                        submission of the names of firms and banks withheld by Major R. B. Hodgson,
                        commanding officer of the Services of Supply in this area, in describing
                        cases of corruption cited in the press conference, and ordering the chairman
                        to take steps immediately to punish the offenders. The first case which was
                        turned over to the committee by Major Hodgson, to be handled exclusively by
                        that committee, was settlement of the Army’s difficulties with regard to
                        leasing of a building recently erected by the Y. M. C. A. This case has
                        practically been settled by the committee at the time of preparation of this
                        despatch, and the building should be available to the Army in a short
                        time.</p>

                    <p>The mission of the South East Asia Command is to defeat the enemy in and
                        presumably occupy former British and Dutch colonies and Thailand. French
                        Indochina may later be included.</p>
                    <p>In so far as we participate in SEAC operations, we become involved in the
                        politically explosive colonial problems of the British, Dutch and possibly
                        French. In so doing, we compromise ourselves not only with the colonial
                        peoples of Asia but also the free peoples of Asia, including the Chinese.

                        should American boys die to recreate the colonial empires of the British and
                        their Dutch and French satellites?” Finally, more Anglo-American
                        misunderstanding and friction is likely to arise out of our participation in
                        SEAC than out of any other theater.</p>
                    <p>By concentrating our Asiatic effort on operations in and from China we keep
                        to the minimum our involvement in colonial imperialism. We engage in a cause
                        which is popular with Asiatics and the American public. We avoid the mutual
                        mistrust and recrimination over the colonial question, potentially so
                        inimical to harmonious Anglo-American relations.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell has submitted a plan for increased American effort in the
                        China theater. It envisages, among other things, the recapture of Canton,
                        Hong Kong and Shanghai and a possible attack on Formosa. He proposes to use
                        American and Chinese forces to accomplish this. The Chinese welcome this
                        plan. It gives them something to fight for. They have slight interest in
                        entering Burma, Thailand and French Indochina for only the territorial
                        benefit of the British and the French. But their own territory and Formosa
                        (which they claim) provide a real incentive.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Army is great in size. But it is relatively untrained and
                        generally corrupt. However much the Generalissimo and his Army may in
                        principle wish to assume the offensive, they cannot effectively do so
                        excepting under firm American guidance. American leadership can concretely
                        he exercised only as General Stilwell is <pb n="189" xml:id="pg_189" facs="0199"/>given bargaining power, for the Chinese are sharp,
                        practical traders. All aid and concessions to China must therefore be made
                        in consultation with and through General Stilwell.</p>
                    <p>It is not proposed that with a concentration of effort on the China theater
                        we should forthwith turn our backs on SEAC. In cooperation with SEAC we need
                        to retake North Burma immediately and so reopen a land route to China. But
                        after the recapture of North Burma there comes a parting of the ways.</p>
                    <p>The British will wish to throw their main weight southward for the
                        repossession of colonial empire. Our main interest in Asia will lie to the
                        East from whence we can strike directly and in coordination with other
                        American offensives at the center of Japan’s new Empire.</p>

                        which will be the most decisive year in our war against the aggressors.
                        Recent events have clearly shown that this titanic struggle will inevitably
                        end in a total victory for the United Nations who will not lay down arms
                        until their common enemies have unconditionally surrendered. I can assure
                        you that the Chinese people are determined to play their full part in
                        helping to bring about the consummation of our joint task of building a new
                        world which is made truly safe for democracy.</p>

                        supplies in China, written December 14 by Mr. Preston Grover, chief
                        Associated Press correspondent for China and India, which was “killed” by
                        the U. S. Army censorship authorities in Chungking.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Mr. Fisher describes the wave of profiteering
                        which has accompanied every effort of the United States Army authorities in
                        the China theater to acquire materials, buildings or sites locally.
                        Merchants, banks and even persons with semi-official status have made a
                        practice of cornering materials, et cetera, needed by the United States Army
                        and have asked extortionate prices for the sale thereof. The inevitable
                        result has been the widespread knowledge of such acts throughout the
                        American armed forces and their consequent dislike of China. The head of the
                        Kweilin office of OWI recently held a press conference to which were invited
                        representatives of the Chinese newspapers at Kweilin and during which an SOS
                            [<hi rend="italic">OSS?</hi>] officer explained the relation between the
                        high prices the Army was having to pay and the desire of the United States
                        Army authorities to bring into China gasoline, bombs and similar materials
                        rather than ordinary supplies for every day use of the American troops. This
                        conference was described to the Chinese correspondents as being off the
                        record and merely for background material. Following the conference,
                        editorials attacking Chinese profiteering at the expense of China’s American
                        ally appeared in three of the leading Kweilin papers and the local Chamber
                        of Commerce is reported to have agreed to make purchases on behalf of the
                        American forces.</p>
                    <p>Explaining that his despatch is based on interviews and observations in
                        Chungking, Kunming and Kweilin, Mr. Grover states that rampant war
                        profiteering by the Chinese on supplies and services for American forces in
                        China is one of the most vexing problems for Americans here. He describes
                        some of the prices charged by Chinese contractors and adds that complaints
                        to the Chinese Government have so far been fruitless. Mr. Grover’s article
                        also contained a description of the general situation in China which is
                        being made the subject of a separate despatch to the Department.<note n="27" xml:id="d150fn27">Not printed; it stressed “great need of a genuine

                    <p>101. Chinese press item from Lanchow states that on January 16 the Kuomintang
                        headquarters (Tangpu) was inaugurated at Tihua, Sinkiang, General Sheng
                        Shih-tsai, chairman of the provincial government, took oath as chairman of
                        the Tangpu and declared his sincerity of purpose in obeying the director of
                        the party (General Chiang Kai-shek<note n="2" xml:id="d151fn2">President of
                            the Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier).</note>). The Embassy is informed
                        that the Chungking authorities originally sent a party official to Tihua
                        with the idea of appointing him chairman of the Tangpu there; that General
                        Sheng did not approve; and that Sheng’s appointment was compromise
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>It is generally felt that developments in the Sinkiang situation have not
                        warranted early hopes that the province would be brought within the National
                        Government fold. Government troops have not entered the province and it is
                        reported that Russian troops in limited numbers are still at Hami and other
                        centers in Sinkiang. Otherwise there seems to be little or no evidence of
                        Russian political influence although Russian commercial and economic
                        interests are considerable. However, some progress is being made. From
                        Chungking teachers and experts are being sent into Sinkiang and relations
                        are clearly closer than they were a half year ago. General Sheng is no doubt
                        loath to give up strong bargaining position between Russia and China and may
                        be expected to endeavor while giving lip service to the National Government
                        to keep a foot in both camps until the Chungking authorities are in a
                        position to extend their authority by force.</p>

                    <p>I called by appointment on Chou En-lai, Chinese Communist party
                        representative at Chungking, at his official residence yesterday
                        afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Chou volunteered the information that at present time relations between the
                        Chinese communists and the Chinese National Government are “easier”, but he
                        went on to say that there has been no “practical” change. He said that
                        General Lin Piao, a Chinese communist general of considerable repute, is in
                        Chungking and that the latter has been received by the Generalissimo. He
                        said that the Chinese communist military forces have received no military or
                        financial support from the Chinese National Government for the past three
                        and one-half years. He asserted that there are still occasional military
                        clashes between Chinese communist forces and Chinese National Government
                        troop, chiefly in Kiangsi, Anhwei and Hupeh provinces. He declared that the
                        only National Government troops remaining in North China are the forces of
                        General Yen Hsi-shan in southwestern Shansi and some troops in north Honan,
                        north of the Yellow River. Chou said that General Wei Li-huang had been
                        relieved of his command at Loyang, Honan, because he was too friendly with
                        the Chinese communists and too active against the Japanese forces to suit
                        the wishes of the Chinese high command at Chungking. Chou said that General
                        Wei is now living at Chengtu.</p>
                    <p>Chou deplored what he asserted to be the present inactive military and
                        economic policy of the Chinese National Government, saying he feared it
                        might be the cause of misunderstanding between China and her allies. He
                        thought that notwithstanding China’s present difficult supply problem, China
                        could be more active in a military way—especially in guerrilla
                        warfare—against the Japanese. In the economic and financial fields, Chou
                        felt that China should increase production—especially of agricultural
                        crops—and should reduce expenditures. But neither of these programs would be
                        followed, he said.</p>
                    <p>Chou dwelt at some length on possible future Japanese moves: he did not feel
                        that Japan would attack Siberia or India or Australia. He believed that an
                        attempt to crush Chinese resistance is rather more to be expected. He
                        mentioned Yunnan as the most likely objective of Japanese penetration.
                        Changsha and Sian were other possible objectives, he asserted.</p>

                    <p>Chou remarked that the Japanese are bending every effort to strengthen their
                        position in north China. He said that in 1942 they had carried out a
                        so-called “Fifth Campaign” with a view to eliminating Chinese resistance in
                        north China. Like the other campaigns it had been a failure: the Chinese
                        communists remain in the area. He asserted that a General Chou, Chinese
                        communist vice-commander under Peng Teh-huai in the Tai Hang mountain area
                        of Shansi, had been killed during the campaign. Chou remarked that the
                        Japanese are looting central China of its food resources. He said that the
                        Japanese are utilizing more and more puppet troops in the occupied areas of
                        China, withdrawing Japanese troops to other territory. He remarked that
                        according to intelligence available to him, the 2nd Japanese Division had
                        been recently transferred from North China to the south.</p>
                    <p>With reference to conditions in Sinkiang province, Chou remarked that General
                        Sheng Shih-tsai, Chairman of the Sinkiang Provincial Government and local
                        satrap for the past ten years, is a very clever man; and he thought that the
                        Chinese National Government would be well advised to move slowly in taking
                        over control of Sinkiang.</p>
                    <p>When on the point of departing, I remarked that I hoped to be in Sian within
                        the next few months, Chou said that if I cared to go to the special
                        communist area in north Shensi (and could obtain the assent of the National
                        Government authorities), he would be glad, on receipt of word from the
                        Embassy, to arrange for my entry into Yenan. I said that I was interested in
                        a trip to Yenan if it proved to be possible and that I would bear his
                        remarks in mind.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>An outstanding impression gained during the past eighteen months spent in
                        Chungking and in travel through Southwest and Northwest China is that the
                        most careful study should be given to the internal political situation in
                        China, particularly the growing rift between the Kuomintang and the
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>The “United Front” is now definitely a thing of the past and it is impossible
                        to find any optimism regarding the possibility of its resurrection as long
                        as present tendencies continue and the present leadership <pb n="194" xml:id="pg_194" facs="0204"/>of the Kuomintang, both civil and military,
                        remains in power. Far from improving, the situation is deteriorating. In
                        Kuomintang controlled China the countering of Communism is a growing
                        preoccupation of propaganda, of both military and civilian political
                        indoctrination, and of secret police and <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi>
                        activity. There is not only a rigorous suppression of anything coming under
                        the ever widening definition of “Communism” but there appears to be a
                        movement away from even the outward forms of democracy in government. It is
                        now no longer wondered whether civil war can be avoided, but rather whether
                        it can be delayed at least until after a victory over Japan.</p>
                    <p>The dangers and implications of this disunity are obvious and far-reaching.
                        Militarily, the present situation is a great hindrance to any effective war
                        effort by China. Its deterioration into civil war would be disastrous. The
                        situation therefore has direct relationship to our own efforts to defeat
                        Japan. At the present time a large and comparatively well trained and
                        equipped portion of the Kuomintang Army is diverted from active combat
                        against the Japanese to blockade the Communists. In the north (Kansu and
                        Shensi) the lines are well established by multiple lines of block houses and
                        these large forces remain in a condition of armed readiness. Further south
                        (Hupeh, Anhwei, North Kiangsu) the lines are less clearly demarcated and
                        sporadic hostilities, which have gone on for over two years and in which the
                        Kuomintang forces appear to take the initiative, continue.</p>
                    <p>On the other side, the Communist Army is starved of all supplies and forced
                        in turn to immobilize most of its strength to guard against what it
                        considers the Kuomintang threat. It was admitted by both parties that there
                        was extreme tension in Kuomintang-Communist relations in the spring of 1942.
                        The Communists believe that it was only the Japanese invasion of Yunnan that
                        saved them from attack at that time. The Communists and their friends claim,
                        furthermore, that the Kuomintang is devoting its energies to the
                        strengthening of its control over those parts of China accessible to it
                        rather than to fighting Japan. This strengthening of the position of the
                        Kuomintang will of course assist it in reestablishing its control over areas
                        which will then be opened to it. A logical part of such a policy would be
                        the taking over, as soon as an opportunity is found, of the Communist base
                        area in Kansu-Shensi. Success in this move would weaken the Communists and
                        make easier the eventual recapture by the Kuomintang of the Communist
                        guerrilla zones: To support this thesis the Communists point to the campaign
                        in the more extreme Kuomintang publications for the immediate abolition of
                        the “Border Area”. Another factor sometimes suggested as tending to provoke
                        an early Kuomintang attack on the Communists is the desirability, from the
                            <pb n="195" xml:id="pg_195" facs="0205"/>Kuomintang point of view, of
                        disposing of them before China finds itself an active ally of Russia against
                        Japan.</p>
                    <p>The possible positive military value of the Communist army to our war effort
                        should not be ignored. These forces control the territory through which
                        access may be had to Inner Mongolia, Manchuria and Japanese North China
                        bases. The strategic importance of their position would be enhanced by the
                        entry of Russia into the war against Japan. This importance is largely
                        potential but fairly recent reports of continued bitter fighting in Shansi
                        indicate that the Communists are still enough of a force to provoke periodic
                        Japanese “mopping up” campaigns. Reflection of this is found in the
                        intensive Japanese anti-Communist propaganda campaign in North China in the
                        summer of 1941, although the fact must not be overlooked that Japanese
                        propaganda has emphasized the anti-Communist angle to appeal to whatever
                        “collaborationist” elements there may be in occupied China and to the more
                        conservative sections of the Kuomintang. This activity in Shansi and the
                        difficulties of the Japanese there contrast with the inactivity on most of
                        the other Kuomintang-Japanese fronts.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the immediate war aspects, the political implications of this
                        situation are also serious. Assuming that open hostilities are for the time
                        being averted, the eventual defeat and withdrawal of the Japanese will leave
                        the Kuomintang still confronted with the Communists solidly entrenched in
                        most of North China (East Kansu, North Shensi, Shansi, South Chahar, Hopei,
                        Shantung, North Kiangsu and North Anhwei). In addition the Communists will
                        be in position to move into the vacuum created by the Japanese withdrawal
                        from Suiyuan, Jehol and Manchuria, in all of which areas there is already
                        some Communist activity. In the rest of China they will have the sympathy of
                        elements among the liberals, intellectuals, and students. These elements are
                        of uncertain size but of considerable influence in China, and the
                        Kuomintang’s fear of their power, and the power of whatever underground
                        organization the Communists have succeeded in maintaining in the Kuomintang
                        area, is indicated by the size and activity of its various secret police
                        organs.</p>
                    <p>But possibly the greatest potential strength of the Communists, and one
                        reason why military action against them will not be entirely effective at
                        the present time, is their control of the rural areas of North China in the
                        rear of the Japanese. Here the Kuomintang cannot reach them and the
                        Communists have apparently been able to carry out some degree of popular
                        mobilization. I am in possession of a secret Kuomintang publication
                        describing the “Communist Control of Hopei”. It discusses measures of
                        combatting the Communists (by such means, for instance, as the blockade now
                        being enforced) and concludes that if the Communists fail to “cooperate” (i.
                        e. submit to <pb n="196" xml:id="pg_196" facs="0206"/>complete Kuomintang
                        domination) they must be “exterminated”. I hope to make a translation of
                        this pamphlet which would appear to have significance as an official
                        Kuomintang indication of the policy it will pursue in these areas. It seems
                        reasonable to question, as some thoughtful Chinese do, whether the people of
                        these guerrilla zones, after several years of political education and what
                        must be assumed to be at least partial “sovietization”, will accept
                        peacefully the imposition of Kuomintang control activated by such a spirit
                        and implemented by military force and the political repression, and secret
                        police and <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi> power, which are already
                        important adjuncts of party control and which are being steadily
                        strengthened and expanded.</p>
                    <p>Non-Communist Chinese of my acquaintance (as, for instance, the nephew of the
                        well known late editor of the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>) consider
                        the likelihood of civil war the greatest problem facing China. They point
                        out that the Communists are far stronger now than they were when they stood
                        off Kuomintang armies for ten years in Central China and that they will be
                        much stronger yet if it proves that they have succeeded in winning the
                        support of the population in the guerrilla zone. They point to numerous
                        recent instances of successful Communist infiltration into and
                        indoctrination of opposing Chinese armies (such as those of Yen Hsi-shan)
                        and wonder whether this will not cause a prolongation of the struggle and
                        perhaps make a victory for the Kuomintang, or for either side, impossible.
                        There is undoubtedly a strong revulsion in the mind of the average,
                        non-party Chinese to the idea of renewed civil war and the Kuomintang may
                        indeed have difficulty with the loyalty and effectiveness of its conscript
                        troops.</p>
                    <p>Belief in the certainty of eventual civil war leads these same Chinese to
                        question whether the United States has given sufficient realistic
                        consideration to the future in China of democracy. The question is raised
                        whether it is to China’s advantage, or to America’s own interests, for the
                        United States to give the Kuomintang Government large quantities of military
                        supplies which, judging from past experience, are not likely to be used
                        effectively against Japan but will be available for civil war to enforce
                        “unity” in the country by military force. These Chinese also speculate on
                        the position of American troops which may be in China (in support of the
                        Kuomintang Army) if there should be civil war; and wonder what will be the
                        attitude of Russia, especially if it has become by that time a partner in
                        the victory over Japan.</p>
                    <p>But ignoring these problematical implications, there can be no denial that
                        civil war in China, or even the continuation after the defeat of Japan of
                        the present deadlock, will greatly impede the return of peaceful conditions.
                        This blocking of the orderly large scale <pb n="197" xml:id="pg_197" facs="0207"/>rehabilitation of China will in itself seriously and
                        adversely affect American interests. Even if a conflict is averted, the
                        continuance or, as is probable in such an event, the worsening of the
                        already serious economic strains within the country may result in economic
                        collapse. If there is civil war the likelihood of such an economic collapse
                        is of course greater.</p>
                    <p>There is also the possibility that economic difficulties may make the
                        war-weary, over-conscripted and over-taxed farmers fertile ground for
                        Communist propaganda and thus bring about a revolution going beyond the
                        moderate democracy which the Chinese Communists now claim to be seeking.
                        Such a Communist government would probably not be democratic in the American
                        sense. And it is probable, even if the United States did not incur the
                        enmity of the Communists for alleged material or diplomatic support of the
                        Kuomintang, that this Communist government would be more inclined toward
                        friendship and cooperation with Russia than with Great Britain and
                        America.</p>
                    <p>For these reasons it would therefore appear to be in the interest of the
                        United States to make efforts to prevent a deterioration of the internal
                        political situation in China and, if possible, to bring about an
                        improvement.</p>
                    <p>The Communists themselves (Chou En-lai and Lin Piao in a conversation with
                        John Carter Vincent and the undersigned about November 20, 1942) consider
                        that foreign influence (obviously American) with the Kuomintang is the only
                        force that may be able to improve the situation. They admit the difficulty
                        of successful foreign suggestions regarding China’s internal affairs, no
                        matter how tactfully made. But they believe that the reflection of a better
                        informed foreign opinion, official and public, would have some effect on the
                        more far sighted elements of leadership in the Kuomintang, such as the
                        Generalissimo.</p>
                    <p>The Communists suggest several approaches to the problem. One would be the
                        emphasizing in our dealings with the Chinese Government, and in our
                        propaganda to China, of the political nature of the, world conflict;
                        democracy against fascism. This would include constant reiteration of the
                        American hope of seeing the development of genuine democracy in China. It
                        should imply to the Kuomintang our knowledge of and concern over the
                        situation in China.</p>
                    <p>Another suggestion is some sort of recognition of the Chinese Communist army
                        as a participant in the war against fascism. The United States might
                        intervene to the end that the Kuomintang blockade be discontinued and
                        support be given by the Central Government to the Eighteenth Group Army. The
                        Communists hope this might include a specification that the Communist armies
                        receive a proportionate share of American supplies sent to China.</p>
                    <pb n="198" xml:id="pg_198" facs="0208"/>
                    <p>Another way of making our interest in the situation known to the Kuomintang
                        would be to send American representatives to visit the Communist area. I
                        have not heard this proposed by the Communists themselves. But there is no
                        doubt that they would welcome such action.</p>
                    <p>This visit would have the great additional advantage of providing us with
                        comprehensive and reliable information regarding the Communist side of the
                        situation. For instance we might be able to have better answers to some of
                        the following pertinent questions: How faithfully have the Communists
                        carried out their United Front promises? What is the form of their local
                        government? How “Communistic” is it? Does it show any democratic character
                        or possibilities? Has it won any support of the people? How does it compare
                        with conditions of government in Kuomintang China? How does the Communist
                        treatment of the people in such matters as taxation, grain requisition,
                        military service and forced labor compare with that in the Kuomintang
                        territory? What is the military and economic strength of the Communists and
                        what is their probable value to the Allied cause? How have they dealt with
                        problems such as inflation, price control, development of economic resources
                        for carrying on the war, and trading with the enemy? Have the people in the
                        guerrilla area been mobilized and aroused to the degree necessary to support
                        real guerrilla warfare?</p>
                    <p>Without such knowledge, it is difficult to appraise conflicting reports and
                        reach a considered judgment. Due to the Kuomintang blockade, information
                        regarding conditions in the Communist area is at present not available. Such
                        information as we do have is several years out of date, and has limitations
                        as to scope and probable reliability. Carlson<note n="4" xml:id="d153fn4">Maj. Evans Carlson, United States Marine Corps, formerly in
                            China.</note> was primarily a military man and had a limited knowledge
                        of the Chinese language. Most of the journalists who have been able to visit
                        the Communist area appear to have a bias favorable to the Communists. They
                        also suffered from language limitations and were unable to remain in the
                        area for an extended period.</p>
                    <p>I suggest that the American representatives best suited to visit the
                        Communist area are Foreign Service Officers of the China language service.
                        One or two men might be sent. They should combine moderately long term
                        residence at Yenan or its vicinity with fairly extensive travel in the
                        guerrilla area. It is important that they not be required to base a report
                        on a brief visit during which they would be under the influence of official
                        guides, but that they should have a sufficient time to become familiar with
                        conditions and make personal day to day observations.</p>
                    <p>There is mail and telegraphic communication between Yenan and Chungking, and
                        similar communication between various parts of the <pb n="199" xml:id="pg_199" facs="0209"/>Communist area. The officers would

                        Executive Committee; a reply of the Communist Party; and an editorial from

                    <p>[Here follows summary of a portion of the despatch.]</p>
                    <p>The Communists (Chou En-lai and General Lin Piao are referred to) were not
                        particularly apprehensive of an immediate conflict. They were, however,
                        pessimistic regarding any improvement in relations. Lin was concerned over
                        present small scale clashes between Central Government troops and the “New
                        Fourth Army”, and the Government’s insistence on that Army’s <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">theoretical</hi>
                        elimination. Chou was reported to “continue to believe” that “it is a case
                        of <hi rend="italic">when</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">whether</hi>
                        the Kuomintang takes forceful action to liquidate the Communists.” His hope
                        for the avoidance of present trouble is that Chiang Kai-shek’s political
                        wisdom will “steer away from trouble for the time being even though less
                        wise party and military men might wish to have a showdown now.” (I was
                        present at this interview with Chou and Lin which is here only partially
                        reported. Lin was obviously very gloomy and discouraged. He said that he had
                        come to Chungking in regard to the recent clashes between the Central
                        Government and the New Fourth Army, rather than to discuss over-all
                        Kuomintang-Communist relations. Negotiations had proved impossible because
                        of the uncompromising attitude of Chungking military leaders.)</p>

                        leadership, with which I am in entire agreement, was fully developed in a
                        memorandum by John Carter Vincent, entitled: “The Chinese National
                        Government; Its Leadership and Influential Elements”, forwarded by Chungking

                        memorandum is background for many of the unsupported statements made in this
                        despatch.</p>
                    <p>In that memorandum, there were also made several points which have direct
                        relationship to the question of Kuomintang-Communist relations and the
                        likelihood of civil war: the conservative character of the Party follows
                        through to the Army, some parts of which desire to conserve their strength
                        for eventual internal “adjustments”; if Chiang Kai-shek is removed the
                        principal preoccupation will be internal unity; effective measures for
                        financial, economic and social reform cannot be expected from the present
                        leadership either now or in the post-war period; if Russia assists in the
                        defeat of Japan, the liberals and Communists will be greatly strengthened;
                        rather than meet the situation by long overdue reforms, it is likely that
                        the present Kuomintang leadership will go to the extremes of reaction,
                        adopting suppressive measures to kill all opposition.</p>

                    <p>We should, I think, maintain an attitude of intelligent skepticism with
                        regard to reports emphasizing the strength of the “Communist” forces in
                        China and expressing apprehensiveness that civil war in China may be
                        imminent. We should, of course, follow these leads with close attention—but
                        with caution. The suggestion mentioned as coming from a Chinese source that
                        we might see to it that a part of such arms as we ship to China go to the
                        “Communists” is one which, were we to listen to it, would launch us on a
                        course of playing both sides in a foreign country, which we never have
                        followed, which I trust we never will follow, and which, if followed, would
                        be both vicious and stupid. (The Japanese have followed such courses.) It
                        will be interesting to see what Mr. Gauss reports.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday, at a luncheon given by Chou En-lai, Chinese communist
                        representative in Chungking, which was attended by Colonel Barrett, Colonel
                        DePass, Mr. Clubb<note n="14" xml:id="d158fn14">Military Attaché in China,
                            Assistant Military Attaché and Second Secretary of Embassy in China,
                            respectively.</note> and the writer, opportunity was had <pb n="202" xml:id="pg_202" facs="0212"/>to have an informal conversation with
                        General Lin Piao. (General Lin Piao is a very noted Chinese communist
                        military leader. Rather diminutive in appearance, he is 35 years of age and
                        is a native of a village located not far from Hankow, Hupeh. In 1924 he was
                        a student at Whampoa Military Academy at Canton under Generalissimo Chiang
                        Kai-shek. It is said that he was wounded three times in the course of the
                        Generalissimo’s drive against the communists. He also sustained a serious
                        chest wound in a clash with Japanese forces in western Shansi in 1938 or
                        1939. He directed the operations of the Chinese communist forces when they
                        won their most noted victory over the Japanese at Pinghsingkuan in northern
                        Shansi in the autumn of 1937. According to General Lin’s own statement the
                        Japanese suffered 4,000 casualties in this engagement.)</p>
                    <p>General Lin said that he had left Yenan, Shensi, in the early part of October
                        1942 and that he had arrived in Chungking after about three weeks’ travel by
                        truck. He said that life in Yenan is now very difficult, that the only
                        staple food available is millet. He said that Mao Tse-tung, acknowledged
                        leader of the Chinese communists, is in fair health but that he suffers from
                        rheumatism owing to residence in the damp loess caves. He said that now
                        although nearly sixty years of age, General Chu Teh, field commander of the
                        Chinese communist forces, retains his good health. He said that General Chu
                        is in the field, as is the vice commander, General Peng Teh-huai.</p>
                    <p>General Lin said that since coming to Chungking he has been received on two
                        occasions by his old teacher, the Generalissimo. He said that the
                        Generalissimo had received him courteously. It was gathered that he and the
                        Generalissimo had discussed Kuomintang-communist relations; that as a
                        representative of the Chinese communists he had requested that the blockade
                        of the communist special area in north Shensi be lifted, that the communists
                        be supplied with funds, ammunition and medicines. He went on to say that the
                        Generalissimo had evinced sympathy but that nothing concrete had happened.
                        He said that the Kuomintang had demanded that communist forces be
                        incorporated into the national armies, but he said that he feared that this
                        could not be accomplished so long as the National Government and the
                        Kuomintang failed to give the people of China democracy. That had not been
                        done, he said.</p>
                    <p>General Lin said that the Chinese communists are faced with an acute shortage
                        of ammunition (bullets, as he put it in Chinese) and medicines, neither of
                        which category is supplied by the Chinese National Government. He said that
                        the Chinese communists have no <pb n="203" xml:id="pg_203" facs="0213"/>supplies of copper whatsoever. He added that their production of military
                        equipment is limited to hand grenades and mines. He pointed out that in the
                        absence of military supplies—which the Chinese communists had hitherto
                        obtained chiefly from the Japanese—the Chinese communists could do little
                        more than be quiescent. He asserted that if the Chinese communists were only
                        supplied with arms and ammunition and medicines they would go on the
                        offensive and strike hard blows at the Japanese throughout north China.</p>
                    <p>General Lin expressed his views of the Japanese in the following terms: The
                        Japanese have withdrawn very few troops from north China since the start of
                        the Pacific war. They now maintain eight or nine divisions in north China
                        (not including Manchuria), of which about four are in Shansi. It is the
                        definite policy of the Japanese to eliminate all Chinese resistance in the
                        occupied areas, to drive all Chinese troops therefrom, to consolidate their
                        political and economic position in those areas, to utilize the manpower and
                        resources of these areas to assist them in gaining hegemony of all East
                        Asia. General Lin went on to express the opinion that the Japanese would
                        fail to attain these objectives: the Chinese people would never give their
                        support to Japan and the Japanese would fail in their endeavors to sweep
                        Chinese resistance from the so-called occupied areas. General Lin also
                        asserted that, given a good opportunity, the Japanese would certainly
                        endeavor to wrest Siberia from the U. S. S. R.</p>

                    <p>With regard to points numbered 1 and 2, there has been a clear and disturbing
                        deterioration, as the Embassy had repeatedly reported, in the general
                        economic situation in unoccupied China and in the condition of the Chinese
                        armies due to undernourishment, disease and <pb n="204" xml:id="pg_204" facs="0214"/>inaction but it is unlikely and unreasonable that the
                        Chinese Government under present circumstances would find in this state of
                        affairs a pretext for initiating repressive measures that might lead to
                        civil war.</p>
                    <p>With regard to point 3, the Embassy’s information does not indicate that
                        there has been any appreciable growth in the strength of the Communist army.
                        There have been no large defections of national troops and individual
                        defections have not materially affected the situation. It is understood that
                        Communists now have more men than they can adequately arm and are
                        encouraging soldiers to return to farms because of labour shortage. Embassy
                        is informed that in order to avoid irritating the Kuomintang the Communists
                        discourage defection of national troops or purchase of arms from them.</p>
                    <p>Although relations between the Communists and the Kuomintang are far from
                        satisfactory, it is believed that the conclusion drawn is [<hi rend="italic">in</hi>] the report that has reached the Department is not
                        warranted.</p>
                    <p>In this connection particular attention is invited to my recent despatch
                        number 800. Anti-communism continues to be cornerstone of Kuomintang policy
                        but the leaders, notably the Generalissimo, consider it politic and
                        practical to refrain from repressive action at this time. Liquidation of the
                        Communists by the present Kuomintang leadership is a question of “when”
                        rather than “whether”. The time has not arrived. It may never arrive.
                        Russian entrance into the war against Japan would make such a move
                        inadvisable. Liberalization of Kuomintang leadership after peace under
                        pressure from dissatisfied popular and official elements would render
                        conflict improbable. While the war against Japan continues, civil war is not
                        likely to occur. Conversations with informed Kuomintang and Communist
                        leaders here, including Chou En-lai who is mentioned in the Department’s
                        telegram, confirm this opinion.</p>
                    <p>Hall of the National City Bank who recently travelled through Communist
                        territory and stayed some time in Yenan reports that morale there is good,
                        that Communist forces have fair equipment of small arms but need mountain
                        guns and that they are carrying on guerrilla warfare but are impatient of
                        situation which prevents them from collaborating with national armies in
                        attacking Japanese in force. He says that whereas commodities are limited,
                        people seem to have a fair quantity of necessities including medicines. He
                        observes that morale of national troops he saw in south Shensi was not so
                        good, that economic conditions were disturbing, and that corruption among
                        military and civil officials was relatively common compared with apparent
                        absence thereof in Yenan. Incidentally he states that he was well and
                        courteously treated by Chinese throughout his long journey.</p>
                    <pb n="205" xml:id="pg_205" facs="0215"/>
                    <p>In conclusion probably the most encouraging comment that can be made
                        regarding Kuomintang-Communist relations is that they are now much the same
                        as they were when the Embassy described them at some length in its dispatch
                        number 95 of August 20, 1941.<note n="19" xml:id="d159fn19">

                    <p>The Embassy at Chungking in its recent analysis of Kuomintang-Communist
                        relations (telegram 176, February 1, 11 a.m.) stated that the most
                        encouraging comment that can be made is that Kuomintang-Communist relations
                        are now much the same as when the Embassy described them in its despatch no.

                            <p>“… it becomes reasonably clear that there can be little hope of a
                                real united front, that is, a united front grounded upon sincere
                                political and military cooperation. Even though divergent social
                                conceptions were insufficient to keep the parties apart, strong
                                personal prejudice on the part of many of the Kuomintang leaders
                                would effectively prevent real cooperation. Endeavors to bridge the
                                gap between <pb n="206" xml:id="pg_206" facs="0216"/>the older and
                                controlling elements in the Kuomintang and the communist leaders
                                would, it is felt, prove as ineffectual as they were unwelcome. On
                                the other hand, prevention of an open rupture is considered to be
                                quite feasible so long as the common front against Japan is viewed
                                as a necessity and outside assistance in maintaining that front is
                                desired.</p>
                            <p>“Once that necessity ceased to exist, the Kuomintang-Communist feud
                                may be expected to flare up again, probably in the form of
                                hostilities. The foregoing statement assumes a continuation of the
                                present Kuomintang leadership. There is a possibility that the more
                                liberal younger element in the Kuomintang may become sufficiently
                                influential to effect a bridging of the gap—might even through the
                                adoption of needed social and agrarian reforms cut the ground from
                                under the communists and effect a relative degree of political unity
                                in the country. This is in no wise an early prospect but it is worth
                                bearing in mind when taking a long view of the situation.”</p>

                        with Kuomintang-Communist relations, the Embassy made the following
                        comments: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“… Whatever strength the Communist party has derives more from the
                                failures of the Kuomintang than in any positive accomplishment on
                                its own part. Had the Kuomintang had the foresight to adopt simple
                                effective measures for agrarian reform, equitable taxation, and for
                                promotion of home industries along the lines of the Chinese
                                Industrial Cooperatives, for example, it could have cut the ground
                                from under opposition such as the Communists represent. This could
                                still be done but it is feared that the present Kuomintang
                                leadership, sterile in so far as social reform is concerned, is
                                incapable of altering its conservative course.”</p>

               </p>
                    <p>The Embassy expressed the opinion in its recent analysis of
                        Kuomintang-Communist relations (Chungking’s telegram no. 176 of February 1,
                        1943) that the elimination of the Communists by the present leadership of
                        the Kuomintang is a question of “when” rather than “whether”. The Embassy
                        adds, however, that the time has not arrived and may never arrive because
                        Russian entrance into the war against Japan would make such a move
                        inadvisable and because pressure from dissatisfied popular and official
                        elements may enforce a liberalization of Kuomintang leadership after the
                        peace.</p>
                    <p>The chief hope for the delay or avoidance of this conflict is the personal
                        leadership of the Generalissimo, who, as the Ambassador has stated, foresees
                        the harmful effect on foreign opinion which civil war would have and who is
                        still able to restrain the military and more conservative party elements.
                        This view is also held by the Communists who do not expect an immediate
                        worsening of the present condition of armed truce in north and sporadic
                        small-scale encounters in central China.</p>
                    <pb n="207" xml:id="pg_207" facs="0217"/>
                    <p>The opinion that civil war is likely to be delayed would appear to be
                        justified. There are, however, several factors which might possibly bring
                        about Kuomintang-Communist hostilities before the end of the war with Japan.
                        One of these would be the removal of the Generalissimo, which might permit
                        extremist elements to gain control. Another might be Kuomintang fear of
                        growing Communist power, especially among the people of the guerrilla zones
                        in north China. A third might be a fear of possible Russian support of the
                        Communists after the war. It is probably true that Russia does not desire a
                        civil war in China at this time and has therefore given its support only to
                        the Central Government. The Kuomintang may fear that this will not be the
                        case after the war, especially if Russia has had a part in defeating Japan,
                        and the liberal elements in China are strengthened thereby.</p>
                    <p>The present lack of unity in China and immobilization of substantial
                        Kuomintang and Communist forces to offset each other is of importance during
                        the present period because it hinders China’s war effort.</p>
                    <p>Assuming that the present armed truce will continue until the end of the war,
                        there will still remain to be solved the fundamental question of internal
                        peace and unity. It is to be hoped that the Generalissimo, Dr. T. V.
                            Soong<note n="24" xml:id="d161fn24">Chinese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> and other liberal elements may be in a position strong
                        enough to bring about the reforms which can be the basis for lasting peace.
                        However, there is still little evidence of a young, more liberal leadership
                        rising in the Kuomintang itself. It is also possible that the Communists
                        will be in a stronger position than ever before by reason of their probable
                        control of most of north China. There will no longer be the common fear of
                        an external attack. And the economic exhaustion of China and the
                        deterioration of Chinese armies mentioned by Ambassador Gauss in his
                        telegram referred to above will be factors which may contribute to civil war
                        and which may make a Central Government victory in any such civil war
                        difficult.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing is a brief summary of a situation which has serious
                        implications affecting American interests both in the present war effort and
                        in future efforts to assist post-war rehabilitation. It is a situation which
                        merits careful study and the consideration of any action which might
                        appropriately be taken to encourage and further Chinese unity. One possible
                        course of action might be the sending of American officials to visit the
                        Communist areas. This would have the double advantage of informing the
                        Chinese of our interest in the whole question and of providing us with
                        additional information regarding various phases of the problem. However, it
                        is believed that <pb n="208" xml:id="pg_208" facs="0218"/>the Chinese
                        Government authorities would resent our sending representatives to Communist
                        areas, without obtaining prior approval of the Government. And under present
                        circumstances, it is to be doubted whether the Chinese Government would
                        welcome a request for such approval.</p>

                        honor to enclose for the Department’s information a translation of an
                        article from the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> (influential independent
                        Chinese daily) of February 1, 1943, entitled “A True Description of Famine
                        Conditions in Honan” and a translation of an editorial from the February 2
                        edition of that newspaper entitled “Look at Chungking and Think of
                            Honan.”<note n="27" xml:id="d162fn27">Neither printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>The first of these two articles, written by the Honan correspondent of the
                            <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>, describes the widespread suffering
                        of the people in 100 famine-stricken hsien in Honan and the lack of thorough
                        measures of relief, attacks the government for its efforts to carry out its
                        program of collection of taxes in kind and the compulsory purchases of
                        foodstuffs in the face of the famine conditions and appeals for immediate
                        relief for the estimated thirty million famine victims. The editorial calls
                        attention to the circumstance that although the government is reported to
                        have appropriated adequate relief funds there are still millions of refugees
                        who have not yet received such relief and describes as “unendurable” the
                        continued collection of land taxes from the farmers who are threatened with
                        arrest and are forced to sell their land and even the members of their
                        families in order to escape starvation or in order to pay such taxes. A
                        contrast is drawn between conditions in Honan and the circumstances under
                        which people live in Chungking. In connection with the latter point, the
                        editorial goes on to point out the ineffectiveness of the recently applied
                        price control measures, stating that it would require thousands of prisons
                        to hold all the violators of the measures. It concludes with an appeal for
                        relief funds for the Honan famine victims.</p>
                    <p>The publication of this editorial by the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>
                        resulted in a three-day suspension of the newspaper by the Government and
                        foreign press correspondents who attempted to report this matter to their
                            <pb n="209" xml:id="pg_209" facs="0219"/>home offices were not allowed
                        to forward their despatches. A Central News Agency (Government-controlled)
                        correspondent states confidentially that conditions in Honan are even worse
                        than the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> article described and that many
                        Chinese approved the publication of the article. One result has been a
                        campaign conducted by the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> for famine
                        relief in Honan, and the publicity given to conditions in that province has
                        evidently forced the government to take more positive measures to relieve
                        the serious situation.</p>

                        information of the Department copy of Despatch No. 6, February 17,
                            1943,<note n="28" xml:id="d163fn28">Not printed.</note> from Second
                        Secretary Everett F. Drumright on temporary detail to Chengtu. The despatch
                        reports upon the views of General Pai Chung-hsi, Vice Chief of the Chinese
                        General Staff, as expressed in a speech at the Chengtu branch of the Central
                        Military Academy. General Pai’s remarks apparently reflect an increasing
                        dissatisfaction on the part of the Government with the present unmilitary
                        attitude of college and middle school students, their lack of patriotism and
                        the absence of enthusiasm for the war effort.</p>

                        a translation of the Resolution on Fiscal Policy passed by the Central

                        November last.<note n="32" xml:id="d164fn32">Enclosure not
                        printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>It will be noted that the resolution contains four recommendations for fiscal
                        policy and details eight measures for putting the recommendations into
                        effect. The first recommendation is for a balance of receipts and
                        expenditures. The deficit is to be covered by flotation of loans but in
                        order to prevent inflation, a loan quota is recommended. Secondly, revision
                        of the tax system to increase revenue should not overlook the desirability
                        of simplification, the difficulties of the people, and the need for war-time
                        and post-war stability. Thirdly, state-operated enterprises and state-owned
                        property should be managed in a manner to benefit both national finance and
                        the economic life of the people. Fourthly, financial self-sufficiency of the
                        district governments should be an aim of fiscal policy.</p>
                    <p>Y. C. Koo, Vice Minister of Finance, in conversation with the Counselor of
                            Embassy,<note n="33" xml:id="d164fn33">John Carter Vincent.</note>
                        explained that, whereas the Central Executive Committee had shown
                        considerable interest in the financial situation and in methods for
                        improvement, it had not been adversely critical of the Ministry of Finance’s
                        past performance. (The Embassy has heard otherwise from other sources.) Dr.
                        Koo said that every effort would be made to put into effect the
                        recommendations of the C. E. C.</p>
                    <p>It is significant that, in suggesting a quota on loans, the C. E. C. goes
                        definitely on record as desiring a limitation of expenditures. The
                        thirty-six billion dollar budget for 1943 does not reflect an intention to
                        economize, however, and it is doubtful that expenditures for the year will
                        be kept below forty billion, most of which will be obtained through issuance
                        of currency.</p>
                    <p>The recommendation on taxation contains a warning note against adding to the
                        difficulties of the people. It does not mention the fact that taxation on
                        high bracket incomes and speculative profits is inadequately and
                        ineffectually applied and administered. Dr. Koo states that the Ministry of
                        Finance will improve and expand its direct tax system. (See Embassy’s
                        despatch no. 807 of December 21, 1942.<note n="34" xml:id="d164fn34">Not
                            printed.</note>)</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to note in the third recommendation the phrase “Now that
                        planned economy is being introduced into China …” Chinese businessmen and
                        some officials are concerned over the tendency toward state ownership of
                        productive enterprises, toward the creation <pb n="211" xml:id="pg_211" facs="0221"/>of state-owned companies in control of exports, and the
                        establishment of state monopolies of commodities such as matches, salt,
                        tobacco, etc. There are those who fear that after the war the government
                        will be in control of a large portion of external and internal trade and of
                        national production.</p>
                    <p>The policy of promoting fiscal autonomy for the district governments is
                        two-fold in purpose. The Government believes that a sound and, in so far as
                        practical, self-sufficient system of district finance will promote financial
                        stability. It also believes that in creating autonomous fiscal units in the
                        districts depending directly from the national Ministry of Finance, rather
                        than from the provincial governments, a long step will have been taken in
                        breaking up provincialism which is viewed as one of the most potent
                        disintegrative forces in the country. The provinces have in the past been
                        the most fertile field for the militarism of non-conformist and revolting
                        warlords. While endeavoring to build up financial autonomy in the districts,
                        the central government has taken steps during recent years to destroy
                        financial autonomy in the provinces primarily through taking over taxes
                        formerly collected by the provinces (notably the land tax) and making grants
                        to the provinces from the national treasury.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Koo explained that direct taxes on income, transactions, inheritance,
                        etc., constitute one of the principal forms of revenue collected on a
                        district basis, but in accordance with national law and for remittance to
                        the national treasury. However, the Ministry of Finance remits one-third of
                        these taxes back to the districts; not necessarily to the district from
                        which they are derived but in accordance with a schedule of relative need
                        prepared by the provincial authorities. In this way poor districts may
                        benefit at the expense of the richer districts.</p>
                    <p>The program of fiscal autonomy for the districts, directly controlled by the
                        national government, operating alongside the program for establishment of
                        district self government, and displacing the former system of fiscal and, in
                        a large measure, political autonomy in the provinces is one of the most
                        interesting current developments in China. Hailed at times as a move toward
                        democratic forms, it is more realistically described as a preventive against
                        the resurgence of disintegrative provincial forces after the conclusion of
                        the war.</p>
                    <p>The National (Kuomintang) Government is intent upon retaining its authority
                        in the country and it proceeds on the thesis that the best means of doing so
                        is to maintain unity and that the best way to maintain unity is firmly to
                        establish its financial control. If, hand in hand with this program, it has
                        the foresight to adopt an enlightened policy which will benefit and gain the
                        support of the masses of farmers and workers it has a good chance of
                        achieving its objectives.</p>
                    <pb n="212" xml:id="pg_212" facs="0222"/>
                    <p>There is much talk in the press and elsewhere of a democratic China after the
                        war. However, a highly centralized and authoritarian government such as that
                        of the Kuomintang is not uncongenial to the Chinese people provided it rules
                        for the people in sufficient degree to prevent widespread feeling of
                        discontent and injustice. The Kuomintang should take more to heart than it
                        has in the past the words of the Book of History (Confucius): “Heaven sees
                        as the people see; heaven hears as the people hear”. Therein is the
                        democracy of China; and in the innate individualism of the people; not in
                        the ballot and parliaments. If the Kuomintang can adjust its rule to the
                        Confucian precept it should be able to maintain itself against the
                        disintegrative forces of provincialism and regionalism and it need retain
                        little fear of its bête noire, Communism.<note n="35" xml:id="d164fn35">In a
                            memorandum dated April 12 Troy L. Perkins of the Division of Far Eastern
                            Affairs wrote by way of comment on this despatch: “China’s fiscal policy
                            does not appear adequate to overcome or even to relieve the present
                            serious economic situation. The absence of effective proposals for
                            siphoning off war profits, and the indicated large increase in
                            governmental expenditures—without a comparable increase in production—do
                            not augur well for the control of inflation. The present situation in
                            China caUs for more stringent measures. The C. E. C. proposals recall
                            the steps already taken in China for price control, which have been (1)
                            too tentative and too late, and then (2) too rigid (fixed prices instead
                            of controlled prices), and (3) unaccompanied by rationing, the necessary
                            concomitant of price ceilings.”</note>

                    <p>Mr. Rice was introduced to Dr. Hsü at a small social function during the
                        course of which there occurred the conversation outlined below.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hsü stated that he had been given his post of Chief of the Russian
                        Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs because he has long been an
                        advocate of close Sino-Soviet relations. However, he voiced the opinion that
                        the communists in China follow the party line determined in Russia, that the
                        existence in China of an administration not controlled by the Central
                        Government should not be tolerated and that for this reason the communist
                        administration in the northwest must and will be liquidated, whatever the
                        good qualities of the administration or its leaders. Mr. Rice asked him how
                        that would be accomplished. He replied that it would be most sensible to
                        accomplish this through negotiation and agreement, although he was not
                        overly sanguine that both sides would show sufficient wisdom. He said that
                        the alternative is military liquidation of the communists, that this should
                        prove comparatively easy and that while he anticipated no decisive action
                        during the current war he did expect the matter to be settled shortly after
                        the termination of Sino-Japanese hostilities.</p>

                    <p>According to reports from Nanking, Chungking has declared null and void all
                        secret agreements concluded between former Governor of Sinkiang and Soviet
                        Russia between 1931 and 1939 granting the Soviets economic concessions in
                        return for Soviet military aid in suppressing Moslem revolts. The paper
                        further states that a few days later President Roosevelt opened consulate at
                        Sinkiang and that obviously <pb n="214" xml:id="pg_214" facs="0224"/>Chiang

                    <p>In a conversation with Chou En-lai, Communist representative in Chungking, I
                        cautiously explored the possibility of our drawing on Communist intelligence
                        regarding enemy activities. He responded in a seemingly cooperative spirit,
                        but pointed out that for really effective liaison we should have a small
                        group of officers stationed in their territory. Chou’s supply of incoming
                        information from North China is obviously limited. But they had at their
                        command at Yenan and in northern Shansi a steady flow of intelligence
                        regarding the Japanese, particularly with regard to their operations in
                        North China, Manchuria, the Yangtze valley and, until recently, Hainan.</p>
                    <p>Chou reiterated his invitation of last summer for a small group of American
                        officers to set up observers’ posts in Shensi and Shansi. He pointed out
                        that if we plan to assist in driving the Japanese from North China, it is
                        now not too early to begin investigating sites for possible airfields in
                        Shensi, Shansi, Hopei and Shantung and to begin studying at first hand
                        conditions in that area. He seemed to be particularly anxious that an air
                        officer investigate airfield possibilities in Shensi-Shansi. It would be
                        advisable, according to Chou, to indicate to the Central Government at the
                        outset that the observer stations are considered permanent stations for the
                        duration. The personnel could then be rotated without misunderstanding over
                        the principle of American officers proceeding to that area for air and
                        ground intelligence work in cooperation with the Chinese authorities in
                        North China.</p>
                    <p>His organization, Chou said, has received radio reports from its agents on
                        Hainan Island. But the last remaining radio in possession of the Communists
                        on Hainan had apparently ceased to function, for they receive no more direct
                        messages. He stated that the Communists are the strongest force on the
                        island resisting the Japanese.</p>
                    <pb n="215" xml:id="pg_215" facs="0225"/>
                    <p>I then asked him a blunt question, one completely out of my professional
                        character. I said that if we wished to extend lend-lease aid impartially to
                        the Chinese Army, irrespective of political complexion and including those
                        who seemed to be the most anxious to fight the common enemy, would we be
                        able to do so. He shook his head, replying that the prejudice against and
                        suspicion of the Eighteenth Group Army was too strong. He then added that
                        after the American Navy has further whittled down Japanese naval strength
                        and the Chinese Army settles down to the truly formidable task of trying to
                        drive the Japanese Army from China, the Generalissimo’s attitude toward the
                        Communists may undergo a change because General Chiang will discover that
                        the Japanese are much stronger than he now realizes. It is bad to
                        over-estimate the Japanese, Chou commented, it is quite as bad to
                        under-estimate them. The Generalissimo is guilty of the latter error, he
                        said. And when General Chiang discovers that the Japanese are not going to
                        be easily rolled back into the sea, then he may feel that he will have to
                        give more consideration to the Communists.</p>
                    <p>Chou exhibited anxiety over what the Japanese might do in the face of the
                        movement of Chinese troops to Yunnan, the inflow of lend-lease arms by air
                        and the Yunnan training project. He suggested that the Japanese must be
                        suffering from a very strong temptation to attack Yunnan before
                        Chinese-American strength in that area grows much further. If the Japanese
                        occupy Yunnan, he observed, they have gone a long way toward strangulating
                        Free China. And a Japanese invasion of that province poses no great
                        difficulties for the enemy.</p>
                    <p>He corroborated the reports of bad feeling between Chen Cheng<note n="37" xml:id="d168fn37">Commanding Chinese troops in Yunnan.</note> and Ho
                            Ying-chin.<note n="38" xml:id="d168fn38">Chinese War Minister and Chief
                            of Staff.</note> He also stated that Chen Cheng was loath to assume the
                        Yunnan command. He had accepted the command only after considerable pressure
                        from the Generalissimo and had reportedly said just before his departure
                        that he was going to stay only a few days at Kunming after which he intended
                        to return.</p>
                    <p>In discussing General Sun of the 38th Division he remarked that it was a pity
                        that Sun would probably not be eligible to become an Army commander.
                        Explanation: Sun is not one of the Whampoa clique.</p>
                    <p>I asked him if he had seen T. V. Soong during the Foreign Minister’s visit to
                        Chungking. He had. Soong had displayed to him a fair attitude toward the
                        Communists. But Chou had heard that to others, Soong had been critical of
                        the Communists. Chou was not sure whom the Foreign Minister was trying to
                        deceive. He is not sure of Soong’s position beyond recognizing that Soong is
                        personally exceedingly ambitious. …</p>
                    <pb n="216" xml:id="pg_216" facs="0226"/>
                    <p>Chou feels that the Foreign Minister is now biding his time. He remained in
                        his home most of the time in Chungking. He did not interfere in economic
                        matters. The Generalissimo would not permit him to do so because, as Chou
                        remarked, General Chiang knows that H. H. Kung will do as he is told whereas
                        Soong will not, he is too independent. As for foreign affairs, Soong
                        realizes that the formulation of policy rests solely with the Generalissimo,
                        the Foreign Minister’s function being simply to report. That Soong did,
                        following which he retired to his residence where he spent most of his time
                        attending to his own private affairs, including the Bank of China. He made
                        new investments, conspicuously in Kweichow Province.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Minister’s only major political accomplishment, according to
                        Chou, was to institute a temporary housecleaning in the Chinese Red Cross.
                        And this was achieved only after two strained sessions with the
                        Generalissimo and a rather dramatic visit to a meeting of the Executive
                        Yuan. C. T. Wang, who has apparently been mishandling the Red Cross, was
                        removed on the grounds that he was “too elderly and needed a rest” and was
                        replaced by Dr. Chiang Monlin, President of Peking National University.</p>
                    <p>I asked how Soong’s relations with the Kwangsi clique were. Chou said that
                        they were good but that on this last visit the Foreign Minister had
                        apparently studiously avoided having much contact with Pai Chung-hsi.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I asked Chou if he regarded Soong as a progressive force in Chinese
                        politics. He hesitated and then said that there were two sides to Soong’s
                        nature. He intimated that Soong might be considered modern in his outlook
                        and methods, but not because of that necessarily progressive.</p>
                    <p>Premier Tojo’s visit to Nanking was viewed by Chou as a demonstration
                        designed to give the Wang Ching-wei regime face and bolster its morale. He
                        suggested that the visit may also have encompassed negotiations for the
                        further use of Chinese manpower, both industrially (as in the reported
                        transfer of Shanghai skilled labor to Manchuria) and militarily through
                        increased conscription of puppet troops.</p>

                            despatch<note n="39" xml:id="d169fn39">Not printed.</note> submitted by
                        Mr. Drumright, Secretary of the Embassy on detail at Chengtu, <pb n="217" xml:id="pg_217" facs="0227"/>in regard to a meeting of Szechuan
                        delegates of the San Min Chu I (People’s Three Principles) Youth Corps.</p>
                    <p>In the third paragraph of his despatch, Mr. Drumright correctly indicates the
                        significance of the Youth Corps: “It is generally held that the purpose of
                        the San Min Chu I Youth Corps is to direct the political thought of Chinese
                        youth along orthodox channels and specifically to shield them from the
                        communist doctrines which were attracting Chinese youth in large numbers
                        some four or five years ago.” Incidentally, a great deal of the so-called
                        attraction to communist doctrines was and is more a result of
                        dissatisfaction with Kuomintang policies than a positive act of political or
                        social faith. Under the guise of Sun Yat-sen idealism and through an appeal
                        to nationalistic patriotism, an attempt is made to gain the adherence of
                        Youth Corps members to the present Kuomintang political concept and policy
                        of one-party government.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the statement that “the activities of the Youth Corps are
                        being especially pushed in centers of learning”, it is a generally
                        understood fact that the more ardent members of the Corps act as class-room
                        informers for the Ministry of Education’s special intelligence service,
                        reporting on professors as well as fellow students. It is encouraging to
                        note Mr. Drumright’s observation that in Chengtu “there is little
                        spontaneous enthusiasm among Chinese youth of the student type for the Youth

                    <p>398. Reference Department’s 350, March 15, 8 p.m. We have heard nothing of
                        action mentioned in Bern report and do not believe there is any truth in it.
                        The Chinese, as several officials have intimated to me, would very much like
                        to obtain control of the economic concessions granted by Sinkiang to Russia
                        and also to arrange for withdrawal of Russian troops from Sinkiang but they
                        have not been able to do so. Shall make discreet inquiries to ascertain
                        whether there has been any recent change in the situation.</p>

                    <p>I called on the Chinese Ambassador<note n="45" xml:id="d172fn45">Foo
                            Ping-sheung.</note> yesterday to pay my respects on his appointment and
                        assumption of his duties. We had an extended conversation, which was
                        continued today when he returned my call, and for purposes of convenience
                        the two conversations are combined in this memorandum as follows:</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador informed me that he had been for some time Acting Foreign
                        Minister, for the reason that Mr. Soong, the actual Foreign Minister, had
                        spent a great deal of his time abroad, mostly in the United States. He
                        referred to the fact that I was shortly leaving the Soviet Union to return
                        to the Department, and he said that he wished to speak quite frankly to me
                        in the hope that I would convey his observations to my Government.</p>
                    <pb n="219" xml:id="pg_219" facs="0229"/>
                    <p>[Here follows report of remarks on Soviet agreement as to supply route
                        through the Soviet Union to China as reported in telegram No. 183, March 19,
                        5 p.m., <ref target="#pg_600">page 600</ref>.]</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he wished now to tell me quite frankly that the
                        Chinese Government was somewhat concerned over the extent of the help which
                        China might expect after the war toward coping with the enormous task of
                        reconstruction. It has been obvious that China would be unable with its own
                        resources after the war to rehabilitate itself. He wondered whether it would
                        be possible for China to deal directly with private American interests with
                        a view to securing necessary funds for rehabilitation and whether such funds
                        could be expected without there being imposed on China the incubus of a
                        banking consortium such as that which was set up after the last war.<note n="46" xml:id="d172fn46">For China Consortium Agreement, signed October

                                576</ref>.</note> I replied that, without underestimating the
                        seriousness of the task of rehabilitating China, it was my opinion that the
                        problem was relatively more simple in China, with its predominantly
                        agricultural economy, than in the case of highly industrialized nations
                        which had been overrun and devastated by the war, such as Belgium. I further
                        expressed the opinion that the days of the free exportation of capital from
                        the United States had passed, and that I expected that there would be after
                        the war a rigid supervision by the Government of all American funds desired
                        for investment or other use in foreign countries. The Chinese Ambassador
                        replied that he was greatly relieved by the opinion which I had expressed,
                        but he wondered whether that opinion was generally held. I replied smilingly
                        that I had a great many friends in New York who had expressed horror over
                        the possibility of governmental control over the movement of capital,
                        whether internally or externally, but that nevertheless I felt that I had no
                        more than indicated the general trend of opinion in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The conversation then turned to the question whether the cooperation of the
                        Soviet Union with the other members of the United Nations after the war
                        could be confidently expected. The Ambassador said apropos that he wished to
                        inform me in strict secrecy of certain apprehensions which were entertained
                        by the Chinese Government with regard to possible future developments in the
                        Far East. Assuming that the Soviet Union would join the other United
                        Nations, after the defeat of Germany, in the operations looking toward the
                        defeat of Japan—and that was merely an assumption—one would have to envisage
                        the presence of considerable numbers of Soviet troops not only in Sinkiang
                        and Outer Mongolia but also in Manchuria, It would have to be expected that
                        these Soviet forces would be disposed to support the Chinese Communist
                        elements in their opposition <pb n="220" xml:id="pg_220" facs="0230"/>to the
                        Central Government of China, and he was frank to admit that a combination of
                        that character would be extremely difficult for the Chinese Government to
                        eliminate from the areas which he had mentioned. I expressed surprise that
                        he had included Manchuria in that area, and asked whether it was the view of
                        the Chinese Government that the aspirations of the Czarist regime in
                        Manchuria had been inherited by the Soviet Government. The Ambassador
                        replied that without attempting to answer my question directly he need only
                        observe that the Soviet army in Siberia would undoubtedly succeed in making
                        its way into Manchuria sooner than the Chinese army could work its way
                        toward Manchuria from the south. Once the Soviet forces occupied Manchuria
                        he thought it would be extremely difficult to move them out. I recalled that
                        in a recent conversation with Mr. Liu, the Counselor of the Chinese Embassy
                        here, I had urged the importance to China of retaining such undeveloped
                        areas as Sinkiang, Mongolia, and Manchuria for the reason that as the
                        standard of living of the Chinese people rose these areas would have to be
                        counted on to produce foodstuffs and other necessities which a higher
                        standard of living required. The Ambassador said that that was a point which
                        had not failed to receive considerable attention on the part of the Chinese
                        Government. The position in Sinkiang had of late been considerably improved
                        by the recent adherence to the Central Government of the Sinkiang war
                            lord<note n="47" xml:id="d172fn47">Gen. Sheng Shih-tsai.</note> (whose
                        name I did not catch). He said that this General had recently completely
                        changed his colors and was strongly opposed to the further incursion into
                        his area of Soviet influence. It appears that he had recently imprisoned
                        several hundred Chinese who had been collaborating with the Soviet Union.
                        Although the hold of the Russians in Outer Mongolia was very strong, the
                        Chinese Government had not yet abandoned hope of re-extending its influence
                        over that area. Returning to the problem of Sinkiang, the Chinese Ambassador
                        said that he had recently remarked to Mr. Vincent, Counselor of the American
                        Embassy at Chungking, that the Chinese Government would have no objections
                        whatever to the establishment of an American Consulate at Urumchi. He said
                        that he did not know whether Mr. Vincent had acted on this suggestion, but
                        hoped that when I returned to Washington I would inform the Department of
                        the eagerness of the Chinese Government to see the American Government
                        maintain representatives in the capital of Sinkiang Province.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the question of Chinese interests in western China, the
                        Ambassador made further statements of an extremely confidential nature which
                        he desired that I bring to the attention of the Secretary and of Mr.
                        Hornbeck.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                        despatch no. 933, February 15, 1943, concerning famine conditions in Honan,
                        and to enclose herewith copy of China Information Daily Bulletin (Ministry
                        of Information release) of March 17, 1943,<note n="48" xml:id="d173fn48">Not

                        Honan.</p>
                    <p>The Bulletin states that over CNC $200,000,000 (U.S. $10,000,000) has been
                        “set aside” and that some CNC $87,000,000 (U. S. $4,400,000) has actually
                        been “appropriated” or “advanced” to the famine sufferers. Practically all
                        of the funds involved are for various forms of indirect relief—road
                        building, land reclamation, irrigation projects, and for re-colonization
                        plans; CNC $400,000,000, or almost half of the total thus far remitted, is
                        intended for farm loans for the purchase of rice at government controlled
                        prices.</p>
                    <p>There is no mention of any movement whatsoever of actual food or relief
                        commodities into the region, and it is not specified whether there really is
                        a supply of the rice which is to be obtained at the fixed prices. In view of
                        the distance of Honan (the northern portion of which, above the Yellow
                        River, is largely occupied by the Japanese) and of the lateness of the
                        season, it is doubted that the present large transfers of credits, together
                        with their attendant schemes of distribution, will do a great deal to
                        alleviate the sufferings of the thousands who have been starving in that
                        area. However it is indicated that the National Government is interested in
                        displaying a continued concern for their plight.</p>

                        Department’s information a copy of a despatch<note n="48" xml:id="d174fn48">Not printed.</note> concerning the influence of Ko Lao Hui in Szechuan
                        prepared by Mr. Drumright, Secretary of Embassy on detail at Chengtu.</p>
                    <pb n="222" xml:id="pg_222" facs="0232"/>
                    <p>The despatch indicates that the Ko Lao Hui, which might be translated as
                        “Elder Brothers’ Society,” remains an extremely powerful and influential
                        secret society in Szechuan. It is reported to have some connection with Hung
                        Pang and the Ch’ing Pang which are most active in central and eastern China.
                        The Ko Lao Hui is said by Chinese to have a large membership in Szechuan
                        with approximately one-half of the population of Chengtu associated in some
                        capacity with the Society. Control is exercised not by a central organ but
                        by the leaders in each local unit. It is a general axiom that no activity in
                        any area can be undertaken by government organs without the approval of the
                        local unit of the Society and its elders, known in Chinese as “Ta Yeh”. It
                        is significant that the Society is viewed by some Chinese as a bulwark
                        against Communism and that the Kuomintang has endeavored with some success
                        to utilize the Society for its purposes although it has not attempted to
                        absorb or wholly control the Ko Lao Hui. The Embassy has been informed that
                        the Szechuan military leaders are active members of this Society and that
                        Chinese secret service organs, especially that of the notorious Tai Li, are
                        honeycombed with Ko Lao Hui members. Mr. Drumright concludes with the
                        suggestion that an evaluation of the Chinese scene should not overlook the
                        influence and power of Chinese secret societies over the life of the
                        nation.</p>

                    <p>354 [<hi rend="italic">534</hi>]. Department’s 400, March 25, 4 p.m. Minister
                        of Economic Affairs<note n="50" xml:id="d175fn50">Wong Wen-hao</note> has
                        informed CP [<hi rend="italic">me?</hi>] that the major Soviet interest in
                        Sinkiang is the oil refinery west of Tihwa. It is not properly described as
                        a “concession”. It is a company with Sinkiang Chinese at the head and with
                        Russian technical advisers. However, Russians own the refining machinery and
                        to all intents and purposes control the company. Chinese Government is
                        negotiating with the Soviet authorities for agreement to operate refinery
                        cooperatively. Soviets also have interests in an agricultural development
                        organization which Dr. Wong tells me strangely enough maintains an airplane.
                        The Soviets operate an airline from Alma Ata to Hami in which it is
                        understood <pb n="223" xml:id="pg_223" facs="0233"/>the Sinkiang authorities
                        have nominal half interest. Soviet trucks cross Sinkiang transporting
                        materials to China and returning with strategic materials to Alma Ata. Dr.
                        Wong has unconfirmed report that Russians have recently become interested in
                        the exploitation of wolfram deposits in that portion of Hi lying in
                        Sinkiang. Dr. Wong appeared hopeful that the Chinese Government would be
                        able to work out with Soviet authorities arrangements for economic
                        development in Sinkiang on an amicably cooperative basis which gave due
                        respect to Chinese sovereignty.</p>
                    <p>Clubb in Tihwa has been requested to prepare an airmail report in response to
                        Department’s reference telegram. With regard to Sinkiang oil refinery,
                        Department may wish to refer to Embassy’s despatch number 668, October 8,

                    <p>With regard to the final paragraph of the report in which Mr. Liang states
                        that there remained in Sinkiang about 300 Russians of the Soviet Union who
                        served as instructors in the Chinese army, advisors in animal husbandry and
                        in other agricultural and economic enterprises, an informed official of the
                        Chinese Government told me some days ago that Mr. Liang’s statement could
                        not be taken as indication that the 3,000 or more Soviet soldiers, nominally
                        under the command of General Sheng Shih-tsai, had been withdrawn from the
                        province. Those troops are concentrated largely at Hami, and the Chinese
                        Government has no recent information which would indicate that they have
                        been withdrawn.</p>

                        official circles in Chungking whether General Lung Yun will be replaced as
                        Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, there is no questioning the
                        fact that National Government influence, in political as well as military
                        affairs, is now controlling in Yunnan. The actual power in the province has
                        passed into the hands of General Ch’en Ch’eng, supreme military commander in
                        the area and long-time close associate of Generalissimo Chiang. From the
                        standpoint of unity in China and prosecution of the war this is a favorable
                        development. The transition has been gradual and peaceful and the rumored
                        resignation of Lung Yun, if it becomes effective, will cause no serious
                        trouble. I am informed that the National Government does not intend to
                        interfere in local administrative matters except in so far as immediate
                        political and military needs require.</p>

                                sacks of wheat had been sent to the famine affected regions from
                                Shensi province, “under the instructions of the Central Government”.
                                From two military districts in Shensi the army authorities had
                                released from their granaries 110,000 sacks of wheat. It was stated
                                that for several days the Lunghai Railway suspended ordinary traffic
                                and devoted the line exclusively to the shipment of food supplies to
                                Honan. It was claimed that the area to the west of Loyang is now
                                adequately cared for but that emergency conditions still exist east
                                of that point and also, that the situation in the east was now being
                                aggravated by an influx of refugees from Shantung and Hopei to the
                                north.</p>
                            <p>On April 15th it was reported from Loyang that numerous military
                                organizations were contributing grain, and that the western section
                                of the Lunghai Railway was choked with foodstuffs destined for
                                Honan. It was estimated that 21,000 sacks of rice and miscellaneous
                                cereals were being rushed to the famine region.</p>
                            <p>On April 18th it was reported from Sian that the Shensi Provincial
                                Government was sending large quantities of foodstuffs, “in
                                compliance with the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s order”. It was
                                stated that the first batch of more than 1,600 tons of foodstuffs
                                was being transported by the Lunghai Railway.</p>
                            <p>On April 19th it was reported from Loyang that the relief
                                organization was well developed and that it was expected that by the
                                end of April each sufferer will have been given C. N. $10.00 (U. S.
                                $0.50) in cash and 15 catties of corn and 12 catties of wheat.</p>

                        1943.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> It is believed that the future activities of
                        the San Min Chu I Youth Corps will deserve fairly close attention. While
                        there are numerous morale and propaganda agencies in China (New Life
                        Movement, National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, etc.), the dynamic
                        character of the Youth Corps contrasts strongly with the moribund condition
                        of nearly all the others. This movement receives the serious attention of
                        some of the most influential Chinese officials and it appears to be growing
                        rapidly in strength.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <pb n="226" xml:id="pg_226" facs="0236"/>
                    <p>While many of the above affirmations doubtless spring from an understandable
                        Chinese desire to further social consciousness, pride in China’s past,
                        economic independence and scientific progress, it is believed that the
                        highly nationalistic and mechanistic ideology of the German “state
                        philosophy” can be detected in them.</p>
                    <p>As the Embassy has frequently indicated, the San Min Chu I Youth Corps is a
                        “seed-bed” for future Kuomintang leadership. Its present vitality indicates
                        that it may be able to provide badly-needed new life blood (youth) for the
                        Party. However, its leadership and support would appear to assure that its
                        activities will have a reactionary character. Kang Tze, active leader of the
                        Corps, is known to be strongly influenced by German models. Chu Chia-hua
                        (German returned student and Vice President of the Examination Yuan), Chen
                        Li-fu (Minister of Education), Ku Cheng-kang (Minister of Social Affairs)
                        and Chang Tao-fan (Minister of Information) are all reactionary and are all
                        influential in the direction of the Youth Corps. Several of the leading
                        military figures, including Generalissimo Chiang, are vigorous supporters of
                        the Corps. The apparent reluctance of the better student type to join the
                        Corps is understandable but it also has its disturbing aspect, as this
                        situation would indicate eventual control of the movement (and later of the
                        Party) by half-educated rowdies and place-seekers, to the submersion of the
                        humanistic element which has been the strongest force in Chinese
                        civilization at its best.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to my despatch No. 1001 of March 17,
                        1943, concerning the San Min Chu I Youth Corps, I have the honor to report
                        that this organization has just completed its first National Conference at
                        Chungking. Delegates to the Conference represented various provinces of Free
                        China and the occupied areas, the United States, Malaya, Burma, Formosa and
                        Indochina. Of the approximately 350 delegates to the Conference less than 30
                        per cent were estimated by an observer to be students. At a joint meeting of
                        the Central Executive and Central Supervisory Boards (the latter composed of
                        the heads of universities and middle schools) held after the close of the
                        Conference, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, who is Director-General of the
                        Corps, announced that the members of the Central Executive Committee and the
                        Central Supervisory Committee of the Kuomintang <pb n="227" xml:id="pg_227" facs="0237"/>and the Presidents and Vice-Presidents of the Executive,
                        Legislative, Judicial, Control and Examination Yuans would [be] ex-officio
                        Directors of the Corps. The resolutions passed by the Conference were, as
                        summarized by the press, principles for the unified training of the youth,
                        principles for a ten-year plan for the development of the Corps,
                        mobilization of the youth for building a new China, establishment of an
                        organ to administer youth work and promotion of youth welfare.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo in speeches before the Conference outlined the tasks of
                        Chinese youth as extension of rural education and cultural work throughout
                        the entire country, the cultivation of students’ interests in industry and
                        labor, the promotion of scientific and technical movements and the carrying
                        out of the tenets of the New Life Movement. He stated that the Corps must
                        restore and develop the inherent virtues of the nation and reform the old
                        society in order to realize the San Min Chu I and build a modern nation in
                        China. He further laid down five basic principles as a guide for their
                        activities: Youth must respect their elders and superiors; youth must
                        perform manual labor; youth must respect farmers and laborers; youth must
                        uphold equality of sex; and youth must obey government orders. He called
                        upon the members of the Youth Corps to lead the youth of China in adopting
                        these principles: that labor is the first essential of life; that science is
                        the first essential of knowledge; that national reconstruction is work of
                        the first importance; that industry should take precedence over all fields
                        of endeavor; that principle is the foundation of faith; and the national
                        defense is the first essential of nation-building. The Generalissimo
                        stressed that the organization and training of the Corps must be coordinated
                        with the educational system and planning and added that the policy of
                        education in the future must be based on the principles outlined in his
                        book, <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>, that is, to lay emphasis on
                        psychological, ethical, social and economic reconstruction. He added that
                        the training of personnel for carrying out the ten-year plan of economic
                        reconstruction, as described in <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>, is
                        urgently needed and that, therefore, the present educational system must
                        emphasize vocational and technical training in middle schools, in which the
                        Youth Corps will play an important part.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo’s emphasis upon organization, training and discipline of
                        Chinese youth was repeated by General Pai Chung-hsi, Deputy Chief of Staff,
                        who in an address to the Corps called upon the educated youth of the country
                        to enter into active military service in order to improve the quality of the
                        Chinese army, develop a strong national defense and consummate the
                        objectives of the revolution under the standard of the San Min Chu I.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo pointed to the youth of China as the hope of the country
                        upon whom its destiny depends and asserted that any <pb n="228" xml:id="pg_228" facs="0238"/>youth who wished to take part in the
                        reconstruction of a modern China should join the Youth Corps. He repeated
                        the statement made in his book that “the San Min Chu I is the soul of the
                        nation, the Kuomintang is the main artery of the nation and the San Min Chu
                        I Youth Corps is the new blood in this main artery” and added that those who
                        have not joined the Corps have not yet fulfilled their duty.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows report of other details concerning the Youth Corps.]</p>
                    <p>Units of the organization are reported as being very active in
                        Japanese-occupied areas. The Kuomintang may be expected to expand the San
                        Min Chu I Youth Corps among overseas Chinese just as it endeavors to
                        increase its own influence among Chinese abroad. The Embassy has recently
                        issued a visa for entry into the United States to a Mr. Chiang I-chen,
                        adviser to the San Min Chu I Youth Corps, who is proceeding to the United
                        States on behalf of the Chinese Government for the study of youth movements
                        in wartime. It is possible that Mr. Chiang will interest himself more in the
                        San Min Chu I Youth Corps units which are known to exist in the United
                        States than in the study of American youth movements which bear little
                        similarity to the Chinese organization.</p>

                        10 a.m.,<note n="57" xml:id="d181fn57">Not printed.</note> concerning
                        conditions in the Peiping area, I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a copy of a memorandum<note n="57" xml:id="d181fn1">Not printed.</note> describing conditions in that area and the reaction
                        of Chinese youth coming from that area to the treatment accorded them by the
                        Central Government authorities.</p>
                    <p>The information contained in the memorandum was obtained from a Chinese
                        graduate of Catholic University at Peiping who in company with other
                        students left Peiping on January 20. He states that practically all Chinese
                        organizations at Peiping are secretly honeycombed with Chungking and
                        Communist adherents, the latter being particularly strong in the Hsin Min
                        Hui. Many of the students in the four universities now functioning at
                        Peiping are members either of the San Min Chu I Youth Corps or of the Chan
                        Kan Tuan. The students act as espionage agents for the Chungking Government
                        or the Communists <pb n="229" xml:id="pg_229" facs="0239"/>with respect to
                        Japanese military, economic, governmental and political activities and some
                        of them engage in terroristic activities.</p>
                    <p>The group with which the informant traveled proceeded from Peiping by a new
                        route, now being used by travelers from that area, which lies along the
                        Ping-Han Railway to Hsinhsiang, Honan, thence by the Taoching Railway to
                        Huaiching from which point they proceeded overland to Wangchao. At that
                        place contact was made with Nanking puppet troops who provided them with
                        passes for entry into Free China and who appeared to maintain close liaison
                        with the Chungking authorities. From Wangchao they proceeded south across
                        the Yellow River and then to Loyang.</p>
                    <p>The informant and his party had left Peiping with the assistance of the Chan
                        Kan Tuan which had invited them to go to Sian for a six months military
                        training course upon completion of which they would be eligible to become
                        officers in the Chinese army. Representatives of this organization, the head
                        of which is said to be General Hu Tsung-nan, met them at Sian and questioned
                        them closely, apparently being extremely suspicious of their possible
                        connections with the Communists. The quarters given them there consisted of
                        damp dirty rooms with mud floors and without beds or bedclothing and they
                        could obtain no indication of what type of work they would train for other
                        than a vague statement that they might become active in the occupied areas
                        after some training. This discrepancy between what had been promised them at
                        Peiping and actual conditions at Sian led them to leave Sian and proceed to
                        Chengtu and Chungking. Similar treatment of some of the group had occurred
                        in the case of those who applied for positions as interpreters with the
                        Chinese troops in India. After taking the required examinations, they were
                        told that they were not to go to India but to the Yunnan-Burma border for
                        work with transport organs of the army. The result was a feeling that the
                        Chungking authorities had not been honest and fair in their treatment of
                        students who were attracted here by promises which had not been
                        fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>These young Chinese are perhaps representative of many others from well-to-do
                        families who have come to Free China imbued with a desire to contribute
                        something to the war effort against Japan and who now find themselves
                        without money or means of support save for the near-starvation salaries they
                        receive at government offices. Some of them are returning to their homes in
                        occupied areas, feeling that life with their families under Japanese rule is
                        preferable to a bare subsistence-level existence in Free China. The
                        informant made his remarks about the treatment accorded him with obvious
                        reluctance and an air of bewilderment that the Chungking Government could be
                        so indifferent to Chinese youth it had persuaded to come to <pb n="230" xml:id="pg_230" facs="0240"/>Free China. He displayed only a certain
                        grudging admiration for the Communists, praising them for their activities
                        in North China, their treatment of the Chinese people and their endurance of
                        hardships but maintained that their political beliefs were not suitable for
                        China.</p>
                    <p>While it is realized that Chinese students have largely remained outside
                        actual war activities, particularly in Free China, students in the occupied
                        areas who have been far removed from Chungking authority, who consequently
                        have perhaps been less aware of the workings and trends of the Kuomintang
                        and of the Central Government and who have listened to radio propaganda
                        emanating from Chungking have in many instances given active and concrete
                        support to Chungking activities in the occupied areas. These are the persons
                        who would form a base of support for the present Chinese Government after
                        the war in its effort to reestablish its authority in the areas from which
                        the Japanese had withdrawn. The situation arising from the above-described
                        treatment of students is one which is therefore likely to have an
                        unfavorable effect on the influence of the Chungking Government in those
                        areas which are particularly important in view of the Communist position
                        there and the latter’s appeal to Chinese youth.</p>

                    <p>654. Chou En-lai, representative at Chungking of the Chinese Communist Party,
                        called and ensuing conversation developed the following:</p>
                    <p>Negotiations carried on intermittently for the past half year for settlement
                        between the Kuomintang and the Communists are at a standstill. Lin Piao,
                        Communist General who came to Chungking at the Generalissimo’s invitation in
                        November, is still here awaiting some kind of settlement which it does not
                        appear will be forthcoming (it is not improbable that Lin Piao may be
                        remaining involuntarily). Chou states that Communists have agreed in
                        principle to reduction of their forces and to their concentration in areas
                        north of the Yellow River but have pointed out, with regard to the latter
                        point, the practical impossibility of transferring troops from isolated
                        areas through Jap held territory, and the ill effects of withdrawing their
                        troops from areas which Kuomintang forces are not prepared to occupy. <pb n="231" xml:id="pg_231" facs="0241"/>General Ho Ying-chin has informed
                        Chou that, since the National Government made these two requirements some
                        years ago, circumstances have changed and that the situation must be
                        reconsidered. Communists continue to put forward their four points involving
                        Communist cooperation in struggle to realize principles of San Min Chu I;
                        National Government recognition of right of Communists to participate in the
                        war and in the Government and legalization of local government’s setup in
                        Communist areas; support of Communist armies to enable them actively to
                        fight Japan; and free cooperation now and after the war among all parties
                        under a National Government dedicated to democracy and reconstruction.
                        Kuomintang officials here insist that undefined general principles must be
                        agreed upon before these Communist desiderata can be considered. This is how
                        the matter now stands and, I think, will continue to stand for some time to
                        come. I do not consider, and Chou concurs in this view, that there is any
                        imminent likelihood of an outbreak of civil war; but the determination of
                        Kuomintang leadership, probably stronger now than a year ago, to liquidate
                        the Communists continues to be a sure barrier to cooperation. The very
                        objective of the negotiations, from the standpoint of the Kuomintang, is the
                        elimination of the Communists as a force in China and if this elimination
                        cannot be accomplished through negotiations an attempt will be made when
                        what may be considered a propitious moment arrives to effect it by
                        force.</p>
                    <p>Chou does not anticipate any radical alteration in the situation between
                        Soviet Union and Japan although he feels that the Russians may attack the
                        Japs when they are freed from the German threat. He is anxious that American
                        military and competent civilian observers proceed to guerrilla areas in the
                        north to make studies of the area with a view to preparation for eventual
                        air and land action against the Japs. He envisages such action as
                        coordinated with eventual Russo-Jap hostilities and expresses hope that the
                        Chinese might be able to move through North China into southern Manchuria.
                        He also speaks of the need of Chinese preparations to advance in the Yangtze
                        Valley (against Ichang and Hankow) and further south to take advantage of a
                        hard pressed Japan when an anticipated all out American naval offensive
                        commences. He believes that the Chinese have and can produce, with internal
                        natural and industrial resources, sufficient supplies to carry out limited
                        offensives with little aid, other than aerial, from outside. He deplores
                        present virtual military inactivity in China and speaks regretfully and
                        reproachfully of the lack of offensive spirit shown by the Kuomintang
                        leaders.</p>

                    <p>667. Embassy has learned from reliable sources of existence in Kansu,
                        Kweichow and Ninghsia of unrelated revolts against Central Government
                        authority.</p>
                    <p>Kansu disturbances are most widespread affecting several hsien south of
                        Lanchow where peasants have turned bandit and have at times cut two main
                        roads south from Lanchow. Revolt arose in protest against conscription and
                        collection of land tax in kind and Ma Pu-fang, Governor of Chinghai, is
                        rumored to have taken opportunity to spread disaffection. Kansu Chairman Ku
                        is said to be particularly unpopular with peasantry while General Chu
                        Shao-liang is reported to have allowed movement to spread in order to
                        embarrass Ku. Central Government has dispatched troops and planes to quell
                        bandits who are reported to number between 20 to 50,000 and whose number has
                        been swelled by disaffection of local Pao An Tui.<note n="58" xml:id="d184fn58">Militia.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Disturbance in eastern Kweichow is said to have arisen from tax collection by
                        Central Government authorities and to have been inspired by puppet agents.
                        This is recurrence of similar revolt last autumn.</p>
                    <p>Ninghsia disturbances are reported to have been instigated by Japs using
                        Mongols to arouse people against Central Government authority.</p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="pg_233" facs="0243"/>
                    <p>Although these revolts are unrelated, they may be taken as sign of further
                        possible efforts of Japs and puppets to undermine Chungking and also, taken
                        in conjunction with inefficiency and corruption of Central Government
                        officials in Honan famine disaster, point to possibility of increasing lack
                        of confidence in Chungking Government.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of an
                        informal report made to me on the eve of my departure from Chungking by Mr.
                        Everett Drumright, Second Secretary of Embassy temporarily stationed at
                        Chengtu, Szechuan. I find Mr. Drumright’s comments interesting and in
                        general sound. I am not disposed to be as pessimistic about the outlook in
                        China as he is but if one grants the point that the war may continue for
                        another three years there is no doubt but that a very serious situation will
                        develop in China.</p>
                    <p>I may take the opportunity of my early return to Washington to comment
                        further upon the potential situation described in the enclosure.</p>
                    <p>Respectfully yours,</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">General situation</hi>. Within the past few months and
                            especially during the past two months there has been a serious
                            deterioration in the general situation. As you know there have been
                            uprisings in Kweichow which appear at least in part to be directed
                            against the National Government. In Kansu banditry is rampant and
                            apparently spreading. In Honan there is one of the worst famines that
                            China has experienced within the past fifty years. In Szechuan, the hub
                            of Chinese resistance, there is great uneasiness and tension and there
                            have been small uprisings and an increase in banditry. Down at the front
                            there is very little activity; malnutrition is apparently prevalent <pb n="234" xml:id="pg_234" facs="0244"/>among the troops, sickness is
                            increasing, and the spirit of the troops is said to be flagging.
                            Guerrilla activity is but a name. In the occupied areas the Japanese
                            with a few hundred troops are able to sit behind their elaborate
                            fortifications and contain thousands if not hundreds of thousands of
                            idle Chinese troops.</p>
                        <p>Inflation is one of the chief cankers eating at the heart of the Chinese
                            will to go on. It is probably true that the merchant, agricultural and
                            laboring classes are not irretrievably affected by this force, but
                            inflation seems to be destroying the morality of the country, sapping
                            the spirit of the people. The lack of a clear-cut economic policy in
                            Chungking has added to the ills. Half-hearted attempts to control prices
                            and to enforce the rationing system have threatened to upset the
                            economic equilibrium of the country, stimulate black markets, interfere
                            with production, and bring about higher rather than lower prices. And
                            then, of course, there is the fiscal problem which must be very serious
                            and growing even more so, with the issuance of additional bank notes as
                            the only means of filling the breach.</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that the Chinese are heartily sick of the war,
                            that they want it to be over as soon as possible. It seems very obvious
                            that they are disillusioned by what has happened since Pearl Harbor.
                            They thought that would mean quick defeat for Japan whereas in fact
                            their lot has been made more difficult in some respects. Surveying their
                            own internal problems which are legion and growing ever more complex and
                            serious, they are beginning to wonder whether they will be able to hold
                            together until Japan is defeated. They are driven to despair when they
                            admit to themselves that the war against Japan must go on for another
                            three or four years—a period that seems an age to a people who have
                            already endured the vicissitudes of war for six years, a people who have
                            exchanged manpower and space for time. But the sands seem to be running
                            out and unless there is a stimulus injected from some direction the will
                            to fight on may collapse in the ruin of the political and economic
                            machine that has enabled China to fight on thus far.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese, in desperate straits as they are, are not encouraged by the
                            thought that an Allied victory in Europe is a common victory in which
                            they share. And they are most certainly not encouraged by the slowness
                            with which they feel that the European campaign is proceeding. They of
                            course want more action against Japan and they want it soon. They may
                            want it in order to take Japanese pressure off their backs (which is in
                            fact more pressing from an economic and financial position than from a
                            military point of view), but I believe that they want decisive action
                            against Japan in the near future because they feel inwardly that they
                            cannot go on supporting the war in even its present relatively quiet
                            atmosphere very much longer. <pb n="235" xml:id="pg_235" facs="0245"/>The Chinese are not only driven to pessimism and despair by the policy
                            of despatching Hitler first, but also because of the seeming lack of
                            concrete assistance given to China at this time. Speeches such as that
                            made not long ago by Prime Minister Churchill do incalculable harm; they
                            tend to shatter the spirit and morale of the Chinese people and such
                            utterances, worse still, tend to cause the Chinese people to have less
                            confidence in their leaders.</p>
                        <p>I believe that the Chinese people still have faith in the United States,
                            in the utterances of President Roosevelt. They believe even yet that the
                            United States will come to their rescue. But it is a matter for
                            speculation as to how long they will continue to feel that way. As you
                            know, the Chinese people as a whole—those who are articulate—have no
                            confidence and faith in the policies and attitudes of Great Britain and
                            Churchill; they feel that Britain fears the rise of a strong China,
                            wants China to remain in a semi-colonial status; they believe that
                            Britain will continue its colonial policy after the war. That feeling on
                            the part of the Chinese people is, if anything, fostered by most Chinese
                            leaders not excepting the Generalissimo himself. There is also an
                            abiding distrust of the Soviet Union prevalent in official and private
                            circles, a distrust abetted by the thorny problem of the Chinese
                            communists now astride of North China and possibly in a position to join
                            hands with the Soviet Union by way of Manchuria if and when Japan
                            collapses. It is an open secret that all this activity looking to the
                            development of the northwest is not based on sound economic policy. The
                            chances are about nine to one that the northwest will not sustain much
                            economic development for the resources to justify large-scale
                            developments do not appear to exist. The real reason for all the
                            activity centered around the economic development of the northwest is
                            political. The Generalissimo, looking to the future, apparently feels
                            that it is necessary to build a barrier in the northwest to stop
                            possible Soviet incursions. He may need such a barrier before he can
                            undertake the work of clearing the Chinese communists from northeast
                            China if that becomes necessary.</p>
                        <p>Getting back to the United States and its policy toward China, it seems
                            to me that we should make a special effort to rejuvenate Chinese morale.
                            The quickest way to do that is to increase our air power out here—if
                            that is possible—and to hit the Japanese hard from the air. Another way
                            to stimulate Chinese morale would be to recover Burma, but that has
                            rather more long-range implications. We need to do something now. We
                            should also, I believe, encourage the Chinese in every way possible to
                            feel that we are coming to their rescue as <pb n="236" xml:id="pg_236" facs="0246"/>soon as we can, that we are exerting every effort to
                            crush Japan as soon as possible. As I said above, the best way to
                            demonstrate our good faith is to do it right here in China. The Chinese
                            are glad to see us win victories in the Pacific and off Australia, but
                            they are now tired and not so rational as they might be. They want
                            something done here. If we could come in with powerful air support and
                            create havoc among the Japanese and their installations, it would, I
                            believe, revive the drooping morale of the Chinese. But even more
                            important it would, I believe, revive their confidence in their leaders
                            and probably put an end to the threatened defections of the sectional
                            warlords and politicians who, believing that the opportunity is ripe,
                            are apparently beginning to stir up and incite the people. This is a
                            trend that will have to be stopped if we wish China to continue
                            organized resistance to Japan, and we can play a large part in
                            suppressing the secret ambitions of the warlords who place personal
                            aggrandizement and gain above everything and who would bring back the
                            reign of anarchy that existed after the downfall of the Manchu Dynasty.
                            I realize that what I have said above is couched in a very pessimistic
                            vein, but I feel very strongly that it reflects the present trend of
                            events in this country. I do not wish to go on record as predicting that
                            the Chiang Kai-shek regime will collapse tomorrow; it will probably be
                            able to carry on for some time yet barring a widespread famine. But I do
                            feel that the seeds of disintegration have been planted, that we should
                            recognize that fact and the serious implications it holds for the United
                            States and the other United Nations and that we should do all within our
                            power—as we may be doing for all I know—to encourage and support the
                            Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek government.</p>

                        the wounding of seven others. On May 1 there occurred another incident
                        involving the police and the troops when the latter were prevented by the

                        tension prevails throughout the city as a result of the situation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drumright states that so far as he knows no action has been taken to
                        remove or to discipline General Yen Hsiao-hu, the Commander of the Ching Pei
                        Ssu Ling Pu and a member of the Szechuan military clique, but that some such
                        move is necessary if the National Government is to retain any vestige of its
                        prestige in that area.</p>
                    <p>There would appear to be increasing opposition on the part of the Szechuan
                        military clique to the authority of the Central Government, and the recent
                        visit of Dr. H. H. Kung at Chengtu and his reported call on Generals Pan
                        Wen-hua and Liu Wen-hui, Governor of and Pacification Commissioner for
                        Sikang, may be taken as an indication that the Central Government is fully
                        aware of the implications in the situation and is taking action to relieve
                        it. These two members of the Szechuan military group are reported by Mr.
                        Drumright as being involved in this trouble at Chengtu and in the
                        disturbances at Penghsien (see Embassy’s despatch No. 1104, April 26<note n="61" xml:id="d186fn1">Not printed.</note>). In another letter dealing
                        with general conditions in China, Mr. Drumright reports a well-informed
                        Chinese observer as saying that General Teng Hsi-hou, the most powerful of
                        the Szechuan militarists, is, however, still loyal to the Generalissimo and
                        will unquestionably support him if an outright break should come.</p>
                    <p>In a personal letter to Mr. Vincent, Mr. Drumright says that with the absence
                        of Provincial Governor Chang Chun in Chungking and with General Teng
                        Hsi-hou, Pacification Commissioner for Szechuan, in a hospital for an
                        appendectomy at the time of the clash between the police and the troops, the
                        situation came very near to getting out of hand and that the tension
                        continues notwithstanding that Governor Chang is in Chengtu and that Dr. H.
                        H. Kung recently visited that place. General Liu Wen-hui, mentioned above as
                        being involved in the matter, arrived at Chengtu from Yaan at the beginning
                        of May.</p>

                        concerning conditions in Honan Province, there is enclosed copy of a
                        memorandum to the Embassy dated May 5, 1943,<note n="62" xml:id="d187fn1">Not printed.</note> prepared by the Secretary on detail at Chengtu
                        covering an interview with Dr. Robert McClure, a Canadian national who is a
                        director of the Friends Ambulance Unit. Dr. McClure recently arrived in
                        Chengtu from a trip that took him to Chengchow, Honan.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>Dr. McClure declared that the Communist forces are, if anything, less active
                        than the forces of the National Government in opposing the Japanese in North
                            China.<note n="63" xml:id="d187fn63">The Second Secretary of Embassy on
                            detail at Chengtu stated in his memorandum: “Dr. McClure says that units
                            of the ‘Eighth Route Army’ are if anything less active than the forces
                            of the National Government in opposing the Japanese in North China, and
                            he remarks that the term ‘Eighth Route Army’ is now anathema to the
                            Chinese residents of Shansi Province who have come to hate them for
                            their alleged ill treatment of the people. Dr. McClure states that the
                            feeling of the people in the vicinity of Wenhsiang, Shansi, is
                            particularly strong against the Chinese communists.”</note> He added
                        that there is a great exodus of Chinese students from North China, chiefly
                        from the Peiping area, and that the majority is proceeding to the Chengtu
                        and Chungking areas.</p>

                        telegram No. 667 of May 8, 10 a.m. reporting minor revolts against Central
                        Government authorities in several provinces in Free China.</p>
                    <p>There is enclosed a copy of a memorandum dated April 27<note n="62" xml:id="d188fn62">Not printed.</note> prepared by the Secretary of
                        Embassy at Chengtu, on the subject of the rise of banditry in Kansu
                        Province. Mr. Drumright describes <pb n="239" xml:id="pg_239" facs="0249"/>the circumstances of the attack on the American missionaries mentioned
                        above and the impressions of one of those Americans with regard to the
                        general question of banditry in Kansu. The missionary in question estimates
                        that there were approximately 4,000 armed men in the band which attacked the
                        two missionaries and he described them as being well equipped with rifles
                        and horses and well organized. The band was composed of local inhabitants,
                        partly Chinese and partly Moslem, and was said to be robbing both travelers
                        and the local populace. The informant believes that the chief cause of this
                        uprising was economic but states that one of their avowed aims was to
                        massacre and expel Central Government officials who are going to Kansu in
                        increasing numbers. This uprising began approximately two months ago and the
                        bandits are now in considerable numbers in western and southern Kansu, one
                        of the bandits boasting that they number 30,000. The American missionary
                        expressed the belief that the bandits are acting in collusion with the Ko
                        Lao Hui and other secret societies in Kansu. At the time of his departure
                        from Lanchow in late April armed bandits were within five li of the city and
                        road communications with southern Kansu were completely severed with only an
                        occasional vehicle arriving over the road from Sian.</p>
                    <p>Conflicting reports continue to be received by the Embassy concerning the
                        situation in Kansu. Central Government officials state that the uprising has
                        been subdued and that it arose chiefly through opposition of the peasants to
                        the unfair procedure followed in carrying out conscription, the burden
                        falling entirely on the peasantry and wealthier individuals being exempt.
                        Those officials also express the opinion that the Communists have taken the
                        opportunity to spread the revolt. American and other observers, however,
                        feel that the disturbances arose both from conscription of peasants for
                        labor service with the army and from the collection of tax in kind by the
                        provincial officials. There seems to have been a particularly strong feeling
                        against the Provincial Chairman, Ku Cheng-lun. According to the Embassy’s
                        information, the movement has not subsided but on the contrary has probably
                        spread and the Central Government has rushed troops into the region from the
                        Sian area and has employed planes to disperse the bandits. One American
                        newspaper correspondent who traveled over the road from Chengtu to Lanchow
                        at the beginning of the outbreak stated that the bandits roamed in groups of
                        from 500 to 2,000, that the ineffectiveness of planes in quelling the
                        disturbances did not augur well for the Central Government’s hopes of
                        successfully using such methods against the Communists after the war and
                        that the bandits were difficult to apprehend because of the ease with which
                        they were able to turn from bandit to peasant. <pb n="240" xml:id="pg_240" facs="0250"/>All observers appear to agree in the opinion that this
                        uprising has no direct relation to other disturbances in Free China and that
                        there has been no evidence of Japanese or puppet machinations.</p>
                    <p>While the various disturbances throughout Free China are not directly
                        related, the picture taken as a whole is one of increasing unrest, of
                        dissatisfaction with the Central Government and, perhaps most important, a
                        general weariness from the strain of six years of war. Many Chinese
                        observers now speak of the growing tension and the increasingly serious
                        economic and financial strain upon the country as a whole. The friction
                        between the Central Government authorities and the Szechuan military leaders
                        (see Embassy’s despatch No. 1194 of May 18) has grave implications, for if
                        the Central Government is unable to impose its authority in the province in
                        which its capital is located, the situation in provinces more remote from
                        the seat of the Government must be even less hopeful. Even should the
                        Central Government easily quell the present local disturbances, the roots
                        thereof will remain and unless the Government finds some solution of the
                        problems confronting it other than through use of military force, it is not
                        unlikely that there will be further instances of unrest which are certain to
                        be used by the Japanese and puppets to advantage whenever possible.</p>

                    <p>771. The announcement of May 22 of the dissolution of the Comintern has been
                        very well received by Chinese officials. However, with their highly
                        developed interest in post-war problems they seem generally to interpret it
                        more in the terms of those problems as indicating Soviet willingness to
                        cooperate in the postwar world than as a step forward which might have among
                        other things practical application to certain of China’s present problems.
                        Over the weekend I had opportunity to see socially a considerable number of
                        important Chinese and I did not receive from their conversation any
                        impression that consideration has been or will be given to realizing the
                        Soviet action as a possible springboard for moves toward resolving the
                        dissension between the Chinese Communists and the Kuomintang. On the
                        contrary in the opinion of some observers it seems not unlikely that
                        Kuomintang reactionaries will not consider that further repressive <pb n="241" xml:id="pg_241" facs="0251"/>measures against the Chinese
                        Communists may now, at least from the point of view of Sino-Soviet
                        relations, be more safely applied.</p>

                            memorandum<note n="66" xml:id="d190fn66">Not printed.</note> submitted
                        by the Secretary on detail at Chengtu reporting a conversation of May 2,
                        1943, with Dr. C. W. Chang, Dean of the College of Agriculture and Forestry
                        of the University of Nanking, in regard to general conditions in China.
                        Prior to the conversation Dr. Chang had been in Chungking for a month during
                        which time he talked with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and many other
                        prominent Chinese officials.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Chang stated that the fiscal situation is the cause of great concern to
                        the Central Government, for it can hope to raise no more than half of its
                        budget of CN $36,000,000,000 through taxation. Opposition to the efforts of
                        the Government to increase present taxes and impose new ones, together with
                        the possibility of an increase in taxes being used by dissident elements to
                        stir up trouble among the people, forces the Government to proceed
                        cautiously.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the recent disturbances in Kweichow, Szechuan and Kansu
                        (Embassy’s telegram No. 667, May 8, 10 a.m.), Dr. Chang expressed belief
                        that they were instigated by powerful elements opposed to the Chinese
                        Government. He pointed out that the Chinese people are becoming war-weary
                        and disillusioned because of deteriorating internal conditions, the apparent
                        lack of assistance from abroad and the apparent American and British policy
                        of crushing Germany first and Japan afterwards. With the morale and spirit
                        of the Chinese people at a low ebb, local political groups, seeking personal
                        gain and power, appear to be inciting the people to oppose the Central
                        Government and to be causing local unrest. Dr. Chang expressed belief that
                        the most important factor upon which depends the success of the Central
                        Government in overcoming its present difficulties is this year’s harvest.
                        Given unfavorable crops, the Central Government may find it impossible to
                        maintain the unity and peace necessary to continue the war.</p>
                    <pb n="242" xml:id="pg_242" facs="0252"/>
                    <p>In the international field, Dr. Chang outlined the attitude of the Chinese
                        toward the other major powers, asserting that the former consider the United
                        States to be the only real friend China has among the world powers. Great
                        Britain and Soviet Russia are viewed with suspicion and the Generalissimo’s
                        plans for the development of the Northwest arise partly from suspicion of
                        Soviet Russia and the desire to establish a bulwark against possible Soviet
                        menace.</p>
                    <p>The informant includes the Chinese Communist Party among the elements seeking
                        to discredit and destroy the Kuomintang and the Central Government. He
                        stated that they now control parts of Shansi, Shensi, Hopei, Shantung and
                        Kiangsu and that their eventual aim after the defeat of Japan is to extend
                        their control to Manchuria. He charged that the Communists are now
                        cooperating with Wang Ching-wei in endeavoring to expel General Han Teh-chin
                        and his Central Government troops from northern Kiangsu. He was of the
                        opinion that the Communist system of land tenure will alienate the support
                        of the local populace in North China and that with the lack of that support
                        they cannot remain in control of that area.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy concurs with the general thesis of the above described
                        conversation and feels that there is an increasing awareness among the
                        Chinese of the strain of six years of war with its concomitant of rising
                        prices, a steadily deteriorating economic and financial situation and a
                        feeling that the China war theater has been completely subordinated to other
                        war zones with respect to any appreciable military aid from the United
                        Nations. The roots of the unrest in various parts of Free China are chiefly
                        economic and it has not been difficult for dissident elements to take
                        advantage of the opportunity to spread disaffection. The instigators have
                        thus been both those provincial elements which have long resented the
                        encroachment of the Central Government and Japanese and puppet agents who
                        are motivated by a desire to destroy the Chungking Government. The Chinese
                        Communists are convinced that, in view of the anticipated efforts of the
                        Kuomintang to seek the liquidation of the Communist Party and its army
                        through negotiations or by force at the first favorable opportunity, their
                        role vis-à-vis the Kuomintang can never be that of a legal minority party
                        with participation in the Government (Embassy’s despatch No. 1179 of May
                            13<note n="67" xml:id="d190fn67">Not printed.</note>). It would be
                        surprising, therefore, if the Communist Party failed to utilize
                        opportunities to undermine the Kuomintang, but it does not necessarily
                        follow that the Chinese Communists would cooperate with puppet elements in
                        order to overthrow the Central Government. The Communists would have nothing
                        to gain from the cessation of organized resistance to Japan which would
                        result from a capitulation by the Chungking Government, <pb n="243" xml:id="pg_243" facs="0253"/>and the Communists are not sufficiently
                        strong in numbers or in equipment to force the issue with the Central
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Conflicting reports continue to reach the Embassy with regard to the attitude
                        of the people in north China toward the Communist Party and its policies.
                        Some Chinese and the majority of foreign observers who have lived in or
                        passed through that area depict favorably the attitude of the local populate
                        toward the Communists and Communist activity in that area (Embassy’s
                        despatches No. 996 of March 15 and No. 1042 of April 2)<note n="68" xml:id="d190fn68">Neither printed.</note> and state that Communist
                        forces are much more active in guerrilla operations than Central Government
                        troops. Other Chinese harbor a deep-grained suspicion of the Communists and
                        criticize them for their policy of land confiscation and treatment of the
                        Chinese people. It is difficult to reconcile the two divergent views, but in
                        any estimate of the Communist position and the Chinese attitude toward the
                        question there is to be considered the accumulated effect of years of
                        Kuomintang propaganda against the so-called “red bandits” and the natural
                        suspicion which exists with regard to Communism.</p>

                            expressed, Kuomintang praise of the book has been extravagant and there

                        the writing of the book although informed observers agree that the views
                        expressed are entirely those of the Generalissimo. Tao has a background as a
                        long time supporter of Wang Ching-wei and he is said to share Wang’s
                        pro-Fascist ideas. When the Chinese Government moved from Nanking to Hankow
                        in 1937, Tao together with several former Blue Shirt adherents formed a
                        small “literary” society for the purpose of combatting the then strong
                        influence of left-wing writers. He joined Wang Ching-wei at the time of the
                        latter’s desertion of the Chungking Government in 1938 and remained with him
                        for some time at Nanking. In 1940 Tao fled to Hong Kong (Embassy’s telegram

                        to have been reached between the Nanking puppet regime and the Japanese.
                        Since Tao’s return to Chungking, he is said to have become a trusted adviser
                        to the Generalissimo and is regarded as close to the reactionary “CC” clique
                        headed by Chen Li-fu and Chen Kuo-fu, which is commonly considered the most
                        powerful single faction on the Chinese political scene. The book reflects
                        the attitude of the “CC” clique toward questions of economics,
                        industrialization, western liberal thought and the revival of the “ancient
                        virtues” with its emphasis on national defense and industrialization rather
                        than on agrarian reform.</p>

                        the evident intention of the Kuomintang to make of the book a Party “Bible”
                        as a companion text to the San Min Chu I of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Kuomintang
                        praise of and publicity for the book, has been extravagant.</p>
                    <p>As an example of Party publicity for the book, there is transmitted herewith
                        a translation of a special article from the <hi rend="italic">Central Daily

                        liberalism; that even if they do misunderstand, “it is impossible for us to
                        abandon our thoughts to follow them”; that each country has its own national
                        conditions; and that “we oppose liberalism” but do not blindly and radically
                        attack liberalism or individualism. The article goes on to quote the
                        Generalissimo as saying “therefore, I hope that for the interests of the
                        country and for the preservation of the nation, all will with one heart and
                        one mind join together under the creed of the San Min Chu I and unite
                        unanimously under the organization of the Chinese Kuomintang”. In one of the
                        two articles, a translation of excerpts from which are enclosed, Tao
                        Hsi-sheng states that “although we have often received directions from the
                        Generalissimo’s speeches, his books or proclamations, yet the projection or
                            [<hi rend="italic">of?</hi>] a whole policy is hard to find. In the
                        future, we shall have a source (<hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>) to
                        which we may turn.” In the third article the writer states that “after the
                        San Min Chu I, the best text book for political education is the
                        Generalissimo’s <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi> …<note n="75" xml:id="d192fn75">Omission indicated in the original.</note> From this
                        book all youths may get most accurate instructions.”</p>
                    <p>The volume of criticism of the book among Chinese intellectuals has been
                        tremendous and in some cases extremely frank. Many of them have refused to
                        read the book and others have felt that the Generalissimo is setting himself
                        up as a “Sage” as well as a “Hero” and has thus invaded a field for which
                        his background and intellectual attainments have not equipped him. They feel
                        that he lacks vision and progressiveness and that the limitations of his
                        intellectual capacities are clearly shown in this book. They are discouraged
                        in that the Generalissimo should now endeavor to become an arbiter of morals
                        and a philosopher and fear the increasing encroachments on liberal thought
                        at the hands of those close to the Generalissimo. Dr. Sun Fo is reported by
                        several sources as having made the following statement which may be taken as
                        typical of comment in regard to the book: “The book criticizes communism;
                        communism is the state philosophy of our ally, Soviet Russia. It criticizes
                        liberalism; liberalism is the state philosophy of our allies, the United
                        States and Great Britain. The book does not criticize Nazism and Fascism;
                        these are the state philosophies of our enemies, Germany, Japan and
                        Italy.”</p>
                    <p>Communist representatives at Chungking state that the Communist Party has
                        instructed its members to read the book as the best possible source of
                        propaganda for their cause.</p>
                    <p>Foreign observers criticize the book as biassed and antagonistic toward
                        foreigners. Some foreigners state that it represents a pernicious <pb n="247" xml:id="pg_247" facs="0257"/>misuse and misinterpretation of
                        history for political purposes and feel that it might be beneficial both to
                        China and to friendly nations to have an English translation published,
                        thereby revealing the Generalissimo in his true light and thus bringing to
                        other nations a full realization of the forces controlling China. Americans
                        close to the Generalissimo admit the book is suitable only for middle school
                        students or party members and deplore the anti-foreign bias of the book. In
                        this connection, there is enclosed a copy of a memorandum of
                            conversation<note n="76" xml:id="d192fn76">Not printed.</note> with an
                        American member of the Ministry of Information translating section who has
                        been closely connected with the unpublished translation of the original
                        Chinese text.</p>
                    <p>Of more lasting importance than the anti-foreign tone of the book are perhaps
                        the political beliefs held by the Generalissimo and his attitude toward
                        liberal thought and western democratic forms of government as shown in the
                        book. One Chinese comments that the book shows that the Generalissimo is
                        really a Fascist at heart.</p>

                        complimentary given name) which is controlled by the “CC” clique. Most of
                        the books published by this company are political and party propaganda and
                        books of the size of <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>, with poorer
                        print and paper, are usually priced at Ch$20. The book, which is priced at
                        Ch$5, is obviously heavily subsidized. The copy being forwarded with this
                        despatch is the 130th printing of the popular edition dated March 1943 and
                        while no information is available in regard to the total number of copies
                        printed it may be estimated at between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Free copies of
                        the book are said to have been distributed to Kuomintang and Central
                        Government officials. The Embassy finds that the sale of the book at
                        Chungking ceased several weeks ago but has been unable to discover the
                        reasons therefor. Some Chinese state that orders have been given to stop the
                        sales but no confirmation of such report can be obtained from the
                        bookstores.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy feels that <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi> is likely to
                        make difficult the betterment of Sino-foreign relations in so far as the
                        Chinese people are concerned. The resurrection, at a time when a
                        nationalistic China is emerging, of wrongs done to China and their biassed
                        presentation to the Chinese people cannot be conducive to a better
                        understanding of the foreigner on the part of the Chinese masses who will
                        inevitably be given the book as Party propaganda. The masses will be
                        nurtured on propaganda and denied a free press and, in the absence of any
                        impartial portrayal of China’s past relations with the <pb n="248" xml:id="pg_248" facs="0258"/>foreign powers, may be expected to be free
                        of desirable influences which might break down the always latent mistrust of
                        foreigners.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo’s insistence on Kuomintang rule to the exclusion of any
                        share in the government by other political parties and his denial of western
                        liberalism should serve to convince all Chinese of liberal tendencies that
                        there is little hope for them from the Kuomintang. The prestige of the
                        Generalissimo has been greatly lowered in the eyes of the intelligentsia who
                        in the past have felt that he served as a unifying force in China and that
                        his concern was for political and military power. Now that he has emerged as
                        what they term “a sage”, they are discouraged to find him arrayed against
                        them along with the already known reactionary elements of the
                        Kuomintang.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo’s identification of himself as the leader of the Party
                        rather than of the nation has further lowered his prestige among Chinese
                        liberals, but there exists in China a large number of persons who form the
                        nuclei of the various party organs (such as the San Min Chu I Youth Corps,
                        the Central Training Corps, Central Political Institute, Boy Scouts, police
                        training schools, and the <hi rend="italic">gendarmerie</hi>), who for the
                        most part have had no contact with the outside world and who may be expected
                        to accept blindly the material in this book. There should be included among
                        this number many provincial officials who, while perhaps outside the fold of
                        the Kuomintang, are probably equally receptive to the anti-foreign and
                        political propaganda contained in <hi rend="italic">China’s
                        Destiny.</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>As the book is being adopted by the Kuomintang as the source, along with the
                        San Min Chu I, of all that the Party and its leader stand for, it may be
                        conjectured that the book will perhaps serve a useful purpose in that the
                        issue is now more clearly joined between reactionary and liberal forces in
                        China than before its publication. By reason of it there now exists a
                        declaration by the Generalissimo himself of the principles for which he
                        stands and the policy which he intends to follow. Out of the discouragement
                        of liberal elements in China there may grow a more solid opposition to the
                        Kuomintang and there may eventually arise the leadership which is at present
                        lacking. The only concrete opposition at present lies in the Chinese
                        Communist Party and <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi> may serve the
                        cause of all liberals in China, as the Communist Party feels it does for its
                        cause, as the best possible source of propaganda.<note n="77" xml:id="d192fn77">The Chargé summarized this despatch in his telegram

                            been so serious as to necessitate the visit of Dr. H. H. Kung, Vice
                            President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, to Chengtu to
                            consult Szechwan leaders. The Szechwanese have four demands: a Governor
                            suitable to them; equal treatment for provincial troops; local control
                            of capital development; and reduction of land tax in kind and compulsory
                            purchase of grain. Faced with the importance of Szechwan as the chief
                            base of the government, the possibility of unrest, and the power for
                            obstruction of the powerful local interests, the Central Government will
                            probably make some concessions on at least the second and fourth
                            points.</p>

                        regard to the movement of National Government troops into Sinkiang Province,
                        and to report that the regiment of Soviet Russian troops heretofore
                        established at Hami, and Russian military and economic advisers to the
                        Sinkiang Provincial Government, are being withdrawn to the Soviet Union.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The withdrawal evidently comes in the
                            first instance as a result of early Chinese initiative, but the Russian
                            version has in it a suggestion that the extent of Russian withdrawal may
                            come in <pb n="250" xml:id="pg_250" facs="0260"/>part from a Russian
                            decision. There are indications that present developments may not be
                            ultimately uniformly beneficial to China. The original Chinese move
                            appears to have been rooted in a belief that the U. S. S. R. would
                            either succumb to, or be very seriously weakened by, German military
                            action against the Russian Army. The present indications are that such
                            belief may not be more valid in 1943 than it was in 1942, and that in
                            fact future developments in Europe may leave the Soviet Union free to
                            begin reconstruction and fresh production while China is still at war.
                            China has in the past received benefits from barter agreements, which
                            included the extension of credits to China, with the Soviet Union. The
                            Chinese political, and economic, situations are alike such that it
                            stands in need of much assistance still [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].
                            One form of assistance desired by China is military action by the Soviet
                            Union against Japan, others comprise transport facilities, technical
                            assistance, and goods. It is not in any event likely that war will at
                            present break out between Japan and the Soviet Union, unless one or the
                            other feels that such a war is an ineluctable necessity. If the present
                            developments in Sinkiang result from something in the nature of a
                            political contest between China and the Soviet Union, it is only logical
                            to anticipate that in future the Soviet Union may prove somewhat less
                            inclined to be of assistance to China—even where it might be able to
                            assist. This situation affects the United States, which in the first
                            place is presumably desirous that the Soviet Union at least maintain a
                            “cooperative” attitude vis-à-vis United Nations interests in the Pacific
                            area, and which in the second place is now being looked to by China to
                            supply goods not at present available from the Soviet Union—as well as
                            other materials. It is to be concluded that the National Government’s
                            current move may not be an unmixed good for either Sinkiang or China;
                            that perhaps it would have been a more profitable approach, politically,
                            if the National Government had approached the Sinkiang problem more
                            carefully. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>

                    <p>The situation affects the United States in more ways than one. It is
                        presumably granted that it is in the ultimate interest of the United States,
                        in the present circumstances, that the Soviet Union maintain an attitude
                        which is at least “cooperative” vis-à-vis United Nations’ interests in the
                        Pacific area. China’s policies vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, and the
                        consequences they bear for American interests in the Pacific, are therefore
                        of direct concern to us for political reasons. It is to be noted in
                        addition, however, that the Chinese side is evidently now inclined to rely
                        upon the United States, to the exclusion of the Soviet Union insofar as
                        possible, economically as well as politically. In the present circumstances,
                        Chinese hopes of economic assistance from the United States cannot be fully
                        realized, if for no other reason than lack of transport facilities. I
                        believe it probable that the Sinkiang Provincial Government was told by
                        Chungking leaders in 1942 that American goods would enter the province to
                        take the place of the Russian goods now lacking. It nevertheless appears
                        unlikely that electrical machinery, et cetera can be obtained from the
                        United States by Sinkiang in the near future any more than from the <pb n="251" xml:id="pg_251" facs="0261"/>Soviet Union. It is true that
                        Sinkiang has not received any cotton-goods from the Soviet Union for the
                        past year; however, interior China needs such textiles itself, and probably
                        would not trans-ship any large amount to Sinkiang even if they were to be
                        received from India or the United States. The basic premise of the Chinese
                        side, by deduction that the Soviet Union is economically on its knees and
                        that the United States is coming to the front with supplies of all
                        categories for China, therefore places upon the United States an onerous
                        burden which we have not sought and probably would not want in its
                        entirety.</p>
                    <p>Long-term forecasts are admittedly not warranted under wartime conditions,
                        where so many new—and often unexpected—events occur in rapid succession to
                        change the general picture. It is further to be noted that the Chinese are
                        moderately adept, in a myopic way, at trimming their sails to fit the
                        political winds that blow, and they will probably endeavor to make
                        adjustments as developments occur. In the light of recent developments,
                        however, it should not be considered surprising if 1) Sinkiang’s currency,
                        now linked with the Chinese national currency, with the opening of the
                        economic door into interior China, should in due course reach the same low
                        level of the currency inside the Wall; 2) there should occur in Sinkiang,
                        instead of continued implementation of the provincial Three-Year Plan, a
                        goods famine which in certain categories would be more severe than in
                        interior China itself;<note n="*" xml:id="d194fn83">Sinkiang presumably will
                            not undergo actual want in terms of food, rough native cloth, fuel, et
                            cetera, unless the transport facilities of the National Government are
                            developed to the point where drainage out of provincial products on a
                            large scale becomes possible; however, the province needs machinery,
                            cotton-goods, matches, cigarettes, sugar, medicines, and transport
                            equipment. [Footnote in the original.]</note> 3) the Soviet Union should
                        in future prove somewhat less sympathetic and less helpful as regards those
                        of China’s economic and political problems in respect to which it might be
                        in a position to lend assistance; and 4) those elements of Chinese sympathy
                        for the United States which are based upon misconceptions or unbalanced
                        exaggerations should deteriorate or quite disappear when we fail—as seems
                        inevitable—to perform fully the tasks the Chinese themselves have set up for
                        us. It will be realized, of course, that the last-cited hypothetical
                        development would in fact most probably leave Sino-American relationships on
                        a firmer, healthier basis than at present.<note n="82" xml:id="d194fn82">In

                        Service describing the unfavorable reaction among Chinese intellectuals to
                        the increasing tendency of the Generalissimo to interfere arbitrarily in
                        cultural matters and to the strict censorship and cultural control of the
                        Kuomintang.</p>
                    <p>Scholars have traditionally formed a privileged and very influential class in
                        China. They have had an importance far out of proportion to their numbers.
                        The treatment which they have received during the past few years has caused
                        them to lose “face”. Most of them, having had a modern education, dislike
                        the present reactionary trend of that part of the Kuomintang (the C-C group)
                        which controls education and propaganda and is apparently aiming at the
                        exclusion from China of all but Western scientific knowledge. They
                        especially resent the Generalissimo, whom they regard as a poorly educated
                        man, setting himself up in statements to the people and in books such as the
                        recent <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>, as a “sage”.</p>
                    <p>If, as seems to be the case, the Generalissimo and the Party have lost
                        prestige and influence among the intellectuals, the effects may be expected
                        to be felt among the people as a whole.</p>

                        a memorandum<note n="83" xml:id="d196fn83">Not printed.</note> reporting the
                        views of a young, but fairly prominent, Chinese journalist concerning the
                        dangers in the present situation in China.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Many of the members of the present
                            government do not expect the defeat of Japan for at least four years.
                            Because of the rapidly deteriorating economic and military situation in
                            China, and because they now despair of significant assistance from
                            America or Russia, these elements believe that China cannot continue to
                            fight Japan for any such period. Their resolution is being undermined by
                            the Japanese “appeasement” of Wang Ching-wei, by a definite military
                            threat through Hunan and West Hupeh, and by periodic <pb n="253" xml:id="pg_253" facs="0263"/>offers of peace terms—the last of which
                            was brought to Chungking by Wu Kai-hsein. The Government, he feels, in
                            fact cannot continue to fight the war in the present way. Fundamental
                            reforms are necessary or there inevitably must be some compromise with
                            either Japan or Wang Ching-wei. In his opinion, the present reactionary
                            government will never carry out these reforms: The only political group
                            which could do so is the Political Science Group, which, unfortunately
                            to his mind, is now out of favor and in a subordinate position.</p>

                    <p>The views here expressed are undoubtedly pessimistic. But they are believed
                        to be significant as being those of an intelligent and well informed man
                        whose business is political observation. They are a reflection of the
                        obvious discouragement in Chungking among liberals and progressive minded
                        officials.</p>
                    <p>The Political Science Group, on which this observer pins his hopes, is, as
                        the Embassy has reported (see Embassy’s despatch No. 553, dated July 30,
                            1942<note n="84" xml:id="d196fn84">

                        aggregation of administrators and career officials of somewhat similar
                        interests and views. Most of them are foreign trained and tend to be
                        “Western” in attitude and their approach to political, social and economic
                        problems. Not, generally speaking, very liberal—or even greatly concerned
                        with political theories—they can at least be called more “enlightened” than
                        the present groups which appear to dominate the government. It is quite
                        likely that they might give China, as the informant thinks, a better
                        government than the country now enjoys, and bring about certain needed
                        agrarian, taxation, conscription and anti-inflationary reforms. They might
                        even be willing—though many of their number are by reputation strongly
                        anti-Communist—to reenter into cooperation with that party. But to hope for
                        their being given control of the government, in the face of present trends
                        within the Kuomintang and the government and their own recent loss of
                        important positions, seems to fall a little short of political realism.</p>

                        <p>“65, June 11, 11 a.m. Chang, my Chinese colleague, informs me in
                            confidence that the Chinese Consulate[s] at Alma Ata, and Ixhan [<hi rend="italic">Ili and?</hi>] Semipalatinsk and Tashkent, as well as
                            that at or near Minusinsk, which until recently ignored the Chungking
                            Government and recognized only the Sinkiang government, have now placed
                            themselves under the Chungking Government. From some of his remarks I
                            gather that this change was made at the instance of or with the
                            assistance of the Soviet Government for the purpose of improving
                            Moscow-Chungking relations. The pro-Sinkiang elements among the staffs
                            of the above mentioned Consulates are being dispersed among the
                            pro-Chungking Consulates (a Consul at Alma Ata is being transferred to
                            Vladivostok as Vice Consul and the Vice Consul here is being sent to
                            Minusinsk as Consul). The Consulates at Novosibirsk, Chita,
                            Blagovyeshchensk, Khabarovsk and Vladivostok have been and remain
                            pro-Chungking. Chang himself is an ardent Chungking supporter. The
                            release of large numbers of Chinese who have been imprisoned in Siberia,
                            principally in the Kolyma River basin, is further indication of the
                            desire of Moscow to improve relations with Chungking. Released Chinese
                            prisoners are stated to be passing eastwards through Novosibirsk en
                            route to Tashkent and other Central Asian points at the rate of
                            approximately 15 daily. The greater portion of these prisoners were, I
                            am told, refugees who fled from Manchuria to Siberia during the Japanese
                            invasion of 1931–1932. They were arrested, imprisoned and sentenced to
                            penal servitude of several years for having entered the Soviet Union
                            illegally. Upon completion of their sentences and after being at liberty
                            for several days they were again arrested and sentenced for violation of
                            police registration regulations. (Practically none of the refugees
                            possessed passports.)”</p>

                    <p>Information received by the Department indicates that the differences between
                        the Chinese Communists and the Chinese National Government at Chungking are
                        probably of too fundamental a nature to be susceptible of adjustment by
                        amicable negotiation. While an armed clash does not yet appear imminent, it
                        is increasingly apparent that Chungking is determined to liquidate the
                        Communists, and that, if the extreme anti-Communist elements in the
                        Kuomintang retain their present influence, Chungking will not hesitate to
                        attempt to suppress the Communists by force at some favorable
                        opportunity.</p>

                    <p>The attitude of the Soviet Union toward the dispute is of course a factor of
                        vital importance, upon which the outbreak and the outcome of civil war
                        between the Chinese Communists and Chungking might well depend.</p>
                    <p>Information on the recent relations between the Chinese Communists and the
                        Soviet Union is extremely limited and provides no indication of the extent
                        to which the Soviet Union has supported, and might continue to support, the
                        Communists in their present conflict with Chungking. Reports from available
                        sources in China throw no light on the subject. However, it does not appear
                        that the possibilities of obtaining information from sources in Russia have
                        been exhausted.</p>

                    <p>455. The Department would be interested in any indications of the effect
                        which the dissolution of the Comintern may have on the attitude of the
                        Soviet Union toward the so-called Chinese Communists and their relations
                        with the Chungking Government. While it is realized that official statements
                        will probably not be available, it is thought that something of interest
                        might be obtained from newspaper editorials and from a study of news
                        coverage of events in China. For example, a comparison of the volume and
                        character of news concerning guerrilla operations of the Communists
                        published prior to and after the dissolution of the Comintern might prove
                        informative. If available please forward editorials and sample news
                        items.</p>
                    <p>In this connection any information of the presence in Russia or departure
                        therefrom of Chinese Communists (party representatives, students, et cetera)
                        would also be of interest.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that, in lieu of the term “Chinese Communists”, Soviet
                        newspapers may employ other titles, including: Eighth Route Army; Eighteenth
                        Group Army; New Fourth Army; Shensi-Kansu-Ninghsia Border Region; Northwest
                        Border Area; and guerrillas or partisans.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed, as an example of an
                        unusually bitter attack on the Chinese Communist Party, a partial
                            translation<note n="89" xml:id="d200fn89">Not printed.</note> of a
                        special article from the May 27, 1943 issue of the Lanchow <hi rend="italic">Kansu Min Kuo Jih Pao</hi> entitled “Two Attitudes Toward Religion”,
                        written by Pan Kung-chan, member of the Central Executive Committee of the
                        Kuomintang.</p>
                    <p>The main points of the article are as follows: (1) Communism is in its nature
                        fundamentally opposed to religion (to blame the Communist Party for
                        opposition to religion is like blaming a prostitute for being unchaste). (2)
                        The Kuomintang safeguards religion and is for that reason accused by the
                        Communists of being out-of-date in its thinking. (3) The Chinese Communist
                        Party has made an opportunistic and temporary change in its tactics with
                        respect to religion. Apparently adopting a policy of toleration it in
                        reality is attempting to destroy all religions by playing off one against
                        another. The Chinese Communist Party has selected the Muslims for special
                        attention, fostering the false idea that they constitute a separate race.
                        They do this because the Muslims constitute a forceful and cohesive
                        community which the Communists wish to pit against the Han Chinese; the
                        Communist Party, in this respect, is like a person of cannibal habits who
                        fattens children in order later to nourish himself with their roasted
                        bodies. The writer then expresses his confidence that the Muslims, being
                        intelligent, will surely distinguish who is their savior and who is Satan,
                        who is false and deadly and who symbolizes truth and love.</p>

                    <p>1012. 1. In a recent conversation with an officer of the Embassy General Lin
                        Piao, Communist Party representative from Yenan, made comment in regard to
                        Kuomintang-Communist relations as follows:</p>
                    <p>Chiang Kai-shek, during a conference on June 6 with Lin and General Chou,
                        Communist Party representative at Chungking, informed them that his views
                        regarding the differences between the two parties had not changed; that is,
                        the Communist Party should give up its government and army, the party to be
                        given the choice of joining the Kuomintang or of becoming a minority party
                        like other parties now existing in Free China. (Although Lin came to
                        Chungking in October 1942 at the invitation of the Generalissimo, as
                        reported [by] Embassy’s 654, May 6, 10 a.m., Lin has seen Chiang only three
                        times and has been waiting for this final interview for more than 6 months.)
                        The Gmo did not present other terms as a basis of discussion of
                        differences.</p>
                    <p>Lin and Chou plan to depart for Yenan within a few days to discuss matters
                        with Communist leaders there. The former is not optimistic that a settlement
                        can be reached but he does not, on the other hand, think that a clash is
                        imminent. He is of the opinion that the Gmo will have to take into
                        consideration a world trend toward democracy arising from the anticipated
                        United Nations victory and that Chiang will not attempt liquidation of the
                        Communists by force even after the war, although he admits that such a
                        possibility cannot be completely dismissed.</p>
                    <p>2. According to an informed source close to the Communist Party, Lin and Chou
                        are returning to Yenan at this time in order to obtain Communist agreement
                        for some statement to be released at Chungking on July 7, the anniversary of
                        the beginning of the Sino-Jap war, indicating that Kuomintang-Communist
                        relations have improved. This informant states that Chou feels the need of
                        acquainting himself at first hand with conditions at Yenan and of giving the
                        Communist leaders the real picture of the situation at Chungking. Lin and
                        Chou are proceeding with four truck loads of non-military supplies, two of
                        them medicines. (The Central Government authorities have not heretofore
                        permitted the shipment of medical supplies to Yenan for some time.)</p>
                    <p>3. During the conversation above mentioned Lin made the following additional
                        remarks: general developments in China now depend, and after the war will
                        continue to depend greatly, on international <pb n="258" xml:id="pg_258" facs="0268"/>developments (for example, American air victories in China
                        boost Chinese morale and spirit and strengthen the hands of the Chungking
                        Government against the puppets and dissident provincial elements). China can
                        and will continue to resist Japan because the Chungking authorities realize
                        that a negotiated peace with Japan would bring civil war and worse
                        conditions than those which exist at present and because they feel assured
                        of a United Nations victory. Chungking’s lack of military effort against
                        Japan is to be adversely criticized. The Central Government favors a Jap
                        attack against Soviet Russia (this is unlikely) which would require troop
                        withdrawals from China and permit Chungking to occupy the evacuated areas
                        including North China. Liberal elements exist in China, even in the
                        Kuomintang, and this gives hope for the future of democracy here.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>The following memorandum discusses the basis of the present hostility between
                        the Central Government of China and the Chinese Communists. It goes on to
                        examine the probable culmination of this mutual antipathy in civil war. The
                        conclusion is reached that, if civil war occurs, the Soviet Union will
                        probably go to the support of the Communists and the United States will find
                        itself backing the Central Government and so set against Russia.</p>
                    <p>In view of the risks to the United States implicit in the present trend
                        toward civil war in China and in view of our complete lack of official
                        information, both political and military, from the Chinese Communist area,
                        it is recommended that a consulate general be established in Chinese
                        Communist territory and that a military observer’s mission also be sent to
                        that area. These two recommendations are preliminary actions. Any decision
                        regarding a more positive policy toward the Central Government and the
                        Chinese Communists should probably await and be based upon intelligence from
                        the political and military observers.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communist Party was formed during the early 1920’s as a workers’
                        party. With Russian support the Party grew in <pb n="259" xml:id="pg_259" facs="0269"/>strength. Chiang Kai-shek’s 1926 northward campaign from
                        Canton to the Yangtze valley—the campaign by which he came into power—was
                        Communist in character. The Party political leaders, with their Russian
                        advisers, set up a government at Hankow. Shortly after, in 1927, Chiang
                        turned against the Party, having formed an alliance of power with Shanghai
                        big business and banking interests. From that time onward until the
                        establishment of the united front he attempted to crush the Communists.</p>
                    <p>Under pressure from Chiang’s troops the Hankow regime collapsed and the
                        Communists were dispersed. The Russian advisers returned to the Soviet
                        Union. The Communists then operated as a primarily agrarian movement in a
                        number of small rural areas in central and eastern China. Their principal
                        center embraced several counties in southern Kiangsi Province.</p>
                    <p>The Generalissimo visited Sian in December 1936 in connection with his plans
                        for further campaigns against the Communists. At Sian he was kidnapped by
                        Manchurian elements under the command of Marshal Chang Hsueh-liang. The
                        Communists interposed in the negotiations between the Manchurians and Chiang
                        and as a result there was established, following the release of the
                        Generalissimo, a united front. By the terms of the agreement the Communists
                        recognized the Generalissimo as the leader of all China, including Communist
                        China, in united resistance to further Japanese encroachments. They
                        abolished the Red flag and administrative and military terminology which
                        would suggest that they were a separate government. They retained, however,
                        a wide degree of administrative autonomy in that portion of Shensi Province
                        which they occupied.</p>
                    <p>In the first year and a half of the Japanese invasion of China, Chiang,
                        generally speaking, lost in north China the urban centers and lines of
                        communications to the Japanese and the rural areas to the Communists. Most
                        of the Central Government officials in areas through which the Japanese
                        passed fled or went into the services of the enemy as puppets. By this
                        process the Chinese Communists have come to control more territory than they
                        ever have.</p>
                    <p>Present Communist area is estimated by American military sources to total
                        about 120,000 square miles. It is further estimated that approximately
                        25,000,000 people are now living in Communist-controlled territory. The
                        strength of the Communist Eighth Route Army is placed by American military
                        authorities at 60,000–100,000. The Communists themselves claim that they
                        have well over 1,000,000 men under arms. This figure, which is probably an
                        exaggeration, includes guerrillas and armed peasants.</p>
                    <p>Chinese Communist policy appears to have followed the Comintern line. In its
                        initial expression the policy adhered to the program of <pb n="260" xml:id="pg_260" facs="0270"/>world revolution. With the Comintern’s
                        abandonment of this program, the Chinese Communists embraced in 1935, in
                        compliance with Moscow directives, the policy of the united front.</p>
                    <p>The new line, so far as it applied to Asia, was in all probability prompted
                        by the Kremlin’s realistic appraisal of the Soviet Union’s position in the
                        Far East. Russia was threatened by Japan. The Japanese Army had with its
                        Manchurian adventure apparently decided upon a policy of continental
                        expansion. Confronted by a strong Russian Army in eastern Siberia, the
                        Japanese seemed to be intent upon outflanking the Russians through China.
                        China could not be expected to offer strong resistance to Japanese expansion
                        so long as it was torn by internal dissension. It was therefore evident that
                        China should become unified and actively resist Japanese pressure
                        westward.</p>
                    <p>As the Chinese Communists moved away from world revolution to nationalism
                        they also moved in the direction of more moderate internal political and
                        economic policy. Whether these other moves were in compliance with Comintern
                        dictates is less material than that they were historically and
                        evolutionarily sound.</p>
                    <p>The Communists have for some time admitted that China cannot make an
                        immediate transition from its present political and economic forms to
                        communism. They maintain that China is a semi-feudal agricultural country
                        and that before it can attain to communism it must pass through a period of
                        bourgeois democratic nationalism. Their immediate aims are therefore the
                        realization of democratic processes in China. In economic life they advocate
                        the retention of private ownership and individual enterprise.</p>
                    <p>Foreign observers (including Americans) who have recently visited the
                        Communist area agree that the Communist regime in present policy is far
                        removed from orthodox Communism; that it is administratively remarkably
                        honest; that popular elections are held; that individual economic freedom is
                        relatively uncurbed; that the regime appears to have strong popular support
                        and that it is described less accurately as communist than as agrarian
                        democratic.</p>
                    <p>The trend toward nationalism is believed to be strongest among the troops and
                        guerrillas who have been fighting the national enemy. Although we have no
                        accurate information on the subject, it is suspected that the political
                        leaders of the Party retain their pro-Russian orientation and that they are,
                        notwithstanding the dissolution of the Comintern, likely to be susceptible
                        to Moscow direction. This probable schism within the Party may prove at some
                        later date to be of major importance.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>The Central Government of China is based upon the political theory of Sun
                        Yat-sen that, as China is not prepared for democracy, it must <pb n="261" xml:id="pg_261" facs="0271"/>pass through a period of political
                        tutelage. Political tutelage is entrusted to the Kuomintang, the Chinese
                        Nationalist party. Through corruption of the original intent of Dr. Sun, the
                        party has become a mechanism whereby its members are placed and retained in
                        office rather than as a mechanism preparing for popular participation in
                        government.</p>
                    <p>Official position is appointive rather than elective. Nepotism and favoritism
                        are rife. Graft and bribery are commonplace. Among officials of the
                        lower-income brackets this is so because their salaries are inadequate to
                        maintain a decent standard of living. Corruption among the higher officials
                        springs largely from the Chinese tradition that graft is a perquisite of
                        office and not necessarily dishonorable.</p>
                    <p>There is on the part of the average Kuomintang Government official a striking
                        lack of social consciousness, of public trust and duty. This was revealed
                        most recently by the Government’s callous attitude toward the people of
                        Honan during the famine which occurred this spring in that province. The
                        Kuomintang’s Central Government has, in short, done little to change the
                        traditional attitude of the Chinese people that the Government is something
                        to be endured rather than positively supported.</p>
                    <p>For the reasons outlined in the preceding three paragraphs it may be said
                        that the Central Government does not have a popular base. This is in
                        contrast to the relations reported to exist between the Communist
                        administration and the people.</p>
                    <p>Chiang Kai-shek, as distinguished from the Kuomintang and the Central
                        Government which he dominates, is viewed with respect and admiration as the
                        sole national leader. He has this hold because he personifies the national
                        will to resist Japanese invasion and because he successfully maintains the
                        fiction that he is above politics.</p>
                    <p>The truth is, however, that he is deeply involved in politics. He maintains
                        his paramount position in the Government in the same manner that he attained
                        it—by political manipulation of the various factions in the Kuomintang, in
                        the Army and among various semiautonomous provincial leaders. To this extent
                        he rules by a system of balance of power.</p>
                    <p>By the same token he is, in a sense, a political hostage to the corrupt
                        system which he manipulates—he cannot institute sweeping reforms without
                        destroying the balance.</p>
                    <p>His present paramount position in the Central Government is perhaps more
                        secure than it ever has been. But it is not so strong that at some later
                        date he may not be challenged by a faction which may obtain control over a
                        powerful military force.</p>
                    <p>The domestic picture thus far drawn is fairly clear-cut. It is one of
                        contrast between and rivalry between Chiang’s Central Government <pb n="262" xml:id="pg_262" facs="0272"/>and the Chinese Communists. Other factors,
                        however, are also to be considered. One is economic deterioration, which
                        some observers believe may culminate in collapse of the Chiang regime. Such
                        a collapse is not beyond the realm of possibility. But what pattern it would
                        follow is difficult to predict. The most likely pattern would seem to be
                        disintegration into sectionalism with areas along the periphery of Japanese
                        control going over to the enemy and other sections remote from Chungking
                        developing a regional autonomy. Such a situation might so weaken Chiang’s
                        position as to render him vulnerable to an attempted <hi rend="italic">coup
                            d’état.</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>Chiang is aware of this risk. He is combatting it by attempting to ensure the
                        economic well-being of the Central Government and Kuomintang bureaucracy.
                        The bureaucracy is given special rice allowances. And as economic conditions
                        become worse, greater emphasis is laid on party discipline. If Chiang is
                        able to maintain the present economic level of the bureaucracy and the army
                        and if he and the Kuomintang are able to maintain party discipline, he will
                        probably be able to preserve his position despite continued economic
                        deterioration. The citizenry may suffer, as the Honan peasants did this
                        spring, but that will not necessarily mean the collapse of the regime.</p>
                    <p>Another threat to the Generalissimo is the liberal and anti-Kuomintang
                        element in Kuomintang China. This element is understood to be fairly
                        articulate in southwest China. Chiang is also aware of this risk. He is
                        combatting it by secret police methods; through intimidation and
                        regimentation of the intellectuals. It is safe to say, however, that in
                        general the liberals are now so weakened through suppression and economic
                        distress that they constitute only a contingent threat—that is, a threat
                        contingent upon their being able to join forces with some more powerful
                        dissident element, military or civilian, that may arise to challenge
                        Kuomintang control.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                  <hi rend="italic">Basis for Conflict</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>Grave as the threat of economic deterioration and collapse may be, they do
                        not involve in the overall picture as great a risk to us as does the
                        continuing rift between the Central Government and the Chinese Communists.
                        The basis for this rift and potential conflict is discussed in the following
                        three paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>The Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek recognize that the Communists, with the
                        popular support which they enjoy and their reputation for administrative
                        reform and honesty, represent a challenge to the Central Government and its
                        spoils system. The Generalissimo cannot admit the seemingly innocent demands
                        of the Communists that their party be legalized and democratic processes be
                        put into practice. To do so would probably mean the abdication of the
                        Kuomintang and the provincial satraps.</p>
                    <pb n="263" xml:id="pg_263" facs="0273"/>
                    <p>The Communists, on the other hand, dare not accept the Central Government’s
                        invitation that they disband their armies and be absorbed in the national
                        body politic. To do so would be to invite extinction.</p>
                    <p>This impasse will probably be resolved, American and other foreign observers
                        in Chungking agree, by an attempt by the Central Government to liquidate the
                        Communists. This action may be expected to precipitate a civil war from
                        which one of the two contending factions will emerge dominant.</p>
                    <p rend="flushleft">
                  <hi rend="italic">Foreign Involvement</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>If Chiang and the Communists were to fight a civil war without external aid
                        to either side there is little question that, unless it had by then been
                        rendered impotent by the exhaustion of the prolonged war against Japan and
                        by the centrifugal tendencies referred to above, the Central Government by
                        sheer weight of arms would be able to crush the Communists. Such an
                        eventuality is, however, unlikely for the reasons mentioned below.</p>
                    <p>It would only be natural that, should Chiang attack the Communists, the
                        latter would turn for aid to their immediate neighbor, the Soviet Union. And
                        as such an attack would probably not be launched until after the defeat of
                        Japan, the Communists might expect with good reason to receive Russian
                        aid.</p>
                    <p>This would be so because following the defeat of Japan Russia would no longer
                        be threatened on its eastern borders, because the Kremlin’s present need of
                        Chiang Kai-shek’s cooperation would have passed, because Stalin would then
                        presumably prefer to have a friendly if not satellite Chinese Government on
                        his flank, and because the Soviet Union would then have surplus arms in
                        abundance for export.</p>
                    <p>A Central Government attack would therefore in all probability force the
                        Communists into the willing arms of the Russians. The position of the
                        political doctrinaires who have been subservient to Moscow would be
                        strengthened by such an attack. The present trend of the Chinese Communists
                        toward more or less democratic nationalism—confirmed in six years of
                        fighting for the Chinese motherland—would thereby be reversed and they could
                        be expected to retrogress to the position of a Russian satellite.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances they would not be a weak satellite. With Russian arms,
                        with Russian technical assistance and with the popular appeal which they
                        have, the Chinese Communists might be expected to defeat the Central
                        Government and eventually to take over the control of most if not all of
                        China. It may be assumed that a Russo-Chinese bloc, with China as a
                        subservient member of the partnership, would not be welcomed by us. The
                        effect of such a bloc <pb n="264" xml:id="pg_264" facs="0274"/>upon the rest
                        of Asia and upon world stability would be undesirable.</p>
                    <p>Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang lieutenants fully realize the risks of an
                        attack on the Communists. This may explain the reported statements of high
                        officials in Chungking that they must prepare not only for the coming civil
                        war but also for the coming war with Russia. Chiang and his Central
                        Government recognize that they cannot defeat the Communists and the Soviet
                        Union without foreign aid. Such aid would naturally be sought from the
                        United States and possibly Great Britain.</p>
                    <p>We are of course already supplying Lend-Lease war materials to China. All of
                        this equipment is being channelized to the Central Government. None of it
                        goes to the Communists. Ironically enough Russian military supplies to
                        China, also delivered only to the Central Government, have reportedly been
                        given to the 400,000 Central Government troops now understood to be
                        blockading the Communist territory—and thus immobilized in the war against
                        Japan. American Lend-Lease supplies may be expected ultimately to be used
                        for a similar purpose.</p>
                    <p>American Lend-Lease equipment already delivered and to be delivered during
                        the future course of the war will probably, however, not be sufficient to
                        guarantee a Central Government victory in a civil war in which the Russians
                        would be aligned against Chiang. In these circumstances we may anticipate
                        that Chiang Kai-shek will exert every effort and resort to every stratagem
                        to involve us in active support of the Central Government. We will probably
                        be told that if fresh Amercian aid is not forthcoming all of China and
                        eventually all of Asia will be swept by communism. It will be difficult for
                        us to resist such appeals, especially in view of our moral commitments to
                        continued assistance to China during the post-war period.</p>
                    <p>It is therefore not inconceivable that, should Chiang attempt to liquidate
                        the Communists, we would find ourselves entangled not only in a civil war in
                        China but also drawn into conflict with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>Thus far we have scrupulously refrained from giving advice to the Chinese
                        Government on this dangerous internal situation in China. The most we have
                        done was cautiously to express concern over the Central Government’s
                        attempts during the winter of 1940–194i to crush the “Communist” New Fourth
                        Army. Mr. Welles reiterated this view in general terms during October
                            1942.<note n="91" xml:id="d202fn91">See memorandum prepared in the

               </p>
                    <p>We cannot afford to incur the risk of our present hands-off policy toward
                        China. It is a policy of drifting with the course of events. We need a more
                        positive policy, one in which we shall have a larger degree of control over
                        the shaping of our own destiny in Asia. But before we can with assurance
                        formulate such a policy—indeed, even before we can with any precision assess
                        the risks confronting us in the Kuomintang-Communist rift—we must have our
                        own official sources of information in the Communist area. The final
                        decision on policy waits on this information.</p>
                    <p>No American civil official has visited the Chinese Communist area and no
                        American military observer has traveled in it since 1938. We have been
                        dependent upon unofficial travelers for our information about the Chinese
                        Communists. While it has served to construct a consistent and probably
                        accurate picture, it is not information which carries as much assurance as
                        official intelligence. Certainly, if there is to be a turning on the part of
                        the Chinese Communists toward the Soviet Union, we shall want the
                        information of the first symptoms to come promptly and accurately. And that
                        can be only from a skilled American political observer in Communist
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The Communist representative at Chungking, General Chou En-lai, has indicated
                        on several occasions that an American political observer would be welcomed
                        in Communist territory. The Generalissimo would probably not be sympathetic
                        to a request for the despatch of a political observer to or the opening of a
                        consulate general at Yenan, the Communist “capital”. He would, however,
                        probably agree if we placed the request on the grounds of obtaining
                        information and doing everything possible in regard to the welfare of
                        Americans in Japanese-occupied North China and if we were insistent in our
                        request.</p>
                    <p>Parenthetically it may here be observed that we have a stronger bargaining
                        position with Chiang Kai-shek than we seem to be willing to acknowledge. He
                        cannot desert us without disastrous result to himself and most of his
                        principal supporters. We can, on the other hand, accomplish our immediate
                        objective in Asia—the defeat of Japan—without his aid. We may have to in any
                        case.</p>
                    <p>We need not only political information from the Communist area. We need also
                        military information—an accurate estimate of Eighth Route Army and guerrilla
                        strength, their present potential effectiveness against the Japanese, their
                        future potential against the Central Government and an accurate estimate of
                        what we ourselves may be able to do against the enemy in North China. It
                        would therefore seem desirable to request the Central Government for
                        permission to despatch a military observer’s mission to Communist
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The request could be based upon the necessity in planning operations against
                        the enemy for a military survey of North China. It <pb n="266" xml:id="pg_266" facs="0276"/>might be pointed out that North China is an
                        area of major strategic importance in the war against Japan; that it is that
                        part of China closest to Japan; that we now have no airfields in North
                        China; that we wish to survey in that area possible airfield sites; that the
                        main strength of the Japanese Army is in Manchuria and North China; that we
                        shall therefore probably have to fight the major action against the Japanese
                        Army in North China; that it is therefore necessary for our Army to have
                        first-hand information regarding conditions in North China; and that we wish
                        to plan sabotage activities in North China.</p>
                    <p>The most effective approach to the Generalissimo with regard to the despatch
                        of political and military observers to the Communist area would be from the
                        highest American level in Washington through the Chinese Foreign Minister.
                        It is felt that negotiations on this subject conducted by our
                        representatives in Chungking would not carry so much weight as if they were
                        initiated in Washington. It is assumed, of course, that, before making any
                        move with regard to a military observer’s mission, General Stilwell’s
                        approval would be sought. It is likely that he would support such a
                        proposal.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed a copy of despatch No. 1 of
                        May 26, 1943, from the Consulate at Kweilin<note n="92" xml:id="d203fn92">Not printed.</note> in regard to the seizure and detention by the
                        Chinese Special Service Police at Kweilin of Mr. Sa Kungliao, a former
                        newspaper manager and editor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sa is described in the despatch as a well-known liberal who has for some
                        years been associated with movements unsympathetic to the Kuomintang and who
                        has consequently been on the Kuomintang’s blacklist. Formerly manager of a
                        liberal publication at Hong Kong, he has been living in retirement at
                        Kweilin since the fall of Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>It is stated in the despatch that his seizure arose from the circumstance
                        that he introduced two Chinese residents at Kweilin suspected by the
                        Kuomintang of receiving funds from the Soviet authorities for subversive
                        activities to two Soviet military officers of the Soviet <pb n="267" xml:id="pg_267" facs="0277"/>Embassy at Chungking during the latters’
                        recent visit to Kweilin. (It is rumored at Chungking that Mr. Sa was “guilty
                        of giving too many dinners for foreigners” and that he was considered to be
                        successively a spy for the British, the Soviet Russians and the Americans.)
                        The Consulate’s informants believe that the charges against the two suspect
                        Chinese are patently false. Shortly after Mr. Sa introduced the two parties
                        to each other he was kidnapped by the Special Service Police and taken to a
                        concentration camp where he is said to be detained pending the receipt by
                        the Police of further instructions from Chungking.</p>
                    <p>It is indicated in the despatch that this action has convinced liberal
                        elements at Kweilin that any open criticism of the Central Government
                        authorities will be ruthlessly suppressed, by illegal means if necessary.
                        These elements maintain that the conflict is not merely between the
                        Kuomintang and the Communists but between the Kuomintang and all dissenting
                        groups in China regardless of their importance.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is of the opinion that this reported action is but further
                        evidence of the Kuomintang’s resolve to maintain its power by the
                        suppression of any opposing elements. There does not now exist in China any
                        political group, except for the Communist Party, which is of sufficient
                        power and importance effectively to oppose the Kuomintang. The Communist
                        Party strongly believes that its army represents the only guarantee against
                        its liquidation. Due to the present lack of any important liberal group and
                        to the widespread use by the Kuomintang of its secret police, it would seem
                        to be extremely difficult for any movement among purely liberal and
                        democratic groups to make any progress in their efforts to achieve a
                        position of power so long as that position threatened the control of the
                        Kuomintang.</p>
                    <p>Any effective threat to Kuomintang control as exerted at present would,
                        therefore, seem to be possible only from the Communists, from a break-up of
                        the Kuomintang itself or from the withdrawal of support by various military
                        groups within the army. Given the temper of liberal elements within China
                        and with a continuation of present circumstances, the Communist Party might
                        draw to it in a United Front effort the support of democratic groups in
                        China. The Communists themselves feel that there are such groups with which
                        they would be willing and able to cooperate and which may in time be driven
                        to such action by the Kuomintang’s present policy. A split-up of the
                        Kuomintang or the ascendency to power within the Party of its more liberal
                        elements with the consequent decrease in the influence of the reactionary
                        “CC” clique would similarly represent an improvement in the position of all
                        liberal elements in China. The possibility of military factions striving for
                        control after the war <pb n="268" xml:id="pg_268" facs="0278"/>cannot,
                        however, be dismissed, for with the continued conserving of Chinese military
                        strength, which is now felt by many observers to exist, and the delivery to
                        the Chinese armed forces of additional Lend-Lease equipment those who
                        control the armies will be in a strong position to dictate terms to any
                        opposing group. Such an outcome of the struggle for power in China is viewed
                        as a distinct possibility by some Chinese who add that Generalissimo Chiang
                        Kai-shek would not in any case be eliminated from the scene but would remain
                        as a symbol for those in power. There seems, however, at present, and
                        probably until the end of a war from which China will emerge as one of the
                        victorious United Nations, little likelihood of any change in the Kuomintang
                        attitude and policy toward the liberal elements and in the existing
                        political set-up.</p>

                    <p>1059. Honan famine. In a despatch dated June 14 the Embassy officer at Sian
                        comments on Honan famine conditions as follows:</p>
                    <p>American and other observers feel that the worst of the famine is over but
                        that rehabilitation problems will be stupendous. A good wheat harvest
                        assures sufficient food and if the ample rainfall during the spring is
                        followed by seasonable showers in the summer the fall crops of kaoliang,
                        millet, maize and beans should be good. Although the famine conditions are
                        ended, people are still dying in large numbers from malnutrition and
                        recurrent fever (epidemic in some districts).</p>
                    <pb n="269" xml:id="pg_269" facs="0279"/>
                    <p>Foreign relief committees have ceased direct relief except in desperate cases
                        and are concentrating on aid to orphans, widows and transients (transients
                        are coming into unoccupied Honan from Hopei and occupied Honan due to
                        failure of wheat crop there and this now constitutes one of the chief relief
                        problems) and on free medical aid to transients. Relief committee at Loyang
                        plans to embark on social rehabilitation program in the autumn when
                        conditions may be worse than at present with return of further refugees who
                        left Honan during the famine. The people have been scattered, much of the
                        land has been bought up by wealthy landlords, homes have been destroyed and
                        the killing of livestock has been a severe blow to the farmers. The foreign
                        relief committee obtained a grant from the Chinese Government for the
                        purchase and distribution of animals in areas where livestock had been
                        slaughtered but recent reports indicate that Chinese troops stationed in
                        those areas have been taking away the animals.</p>
                    <p>The heavy concentration of troops in Honan has been a heavy burden on the
                        people through their oppression of the population, heavy exactions and
                        plundering. The cost of living is still high but flour, which sold for
                        Ch$l,000 a bag of 30 pounds at height of famine, is now $160. Foreign
                        missionaries in Honan live on meager fare, not being able to afford meat and
                        fruits.</p>

                        Kansu.</p>
                    <p>According to the despatch, American missionaries have reported that when they
                        left there in May conditions in Kansu remained upset with the highway from
                        Lanchow to Minhsien closed to traffic. The latter town was reported to be
                        the center of disturbances, led by one Ma Tien-hsuan, directed against Ku
                        Cheng-lun, Chairman of the Kansu Provincial Government. It is stated in the
                        despatch that in all probability the people in Kansu are restive over
                        conscription practices, taxes and the rising cost of living as well as
                        increasing National Government control of the province. According to a
                        Chinese source, six divisions of Chinese troops were being sent into Kansu
                        to quell the disturbances.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There are enclosed a copy of despatch No. 2 of
                        June 3, 1943 from the Second Secretary at Sian and a copy of a memorandum,
                        transmitted therewith,<note n="94" xml:id="d207fn94">Neither printed.</note>
                        of a conversation with General Hsiung Pin, Chairman of the Shensi Provincial
                        Government. The despatch and memorandum deal with conditions in Shensi and
                        with the Chinese communists, whose principal base is in the northern part of
                        that province.</p>
                    <p>It is stated in the despatch that Shensi has been subjected to a very heavy
                        drain on its supply of foodstuffs because, as a result of the Honan famine,
                        it has had to provide a larger proportion of the food required by the large
                        military concentrations in the northwest, which according to a Chinese
                        source include twenty armies in Shensi and eastern Kansu alone. Prices in
                        Shensi have been very high and the people increasingly restive, but peace
                        and a measure of stability thus far have nevertheless been maintained
                        there.</p>
                    <p>According to General Hsiung, the communists are enveloped on three sides by
                        National Government forces and for that reason have been unable to expand
                        their special area in northern Shensi. He stated that their armaments are
                        inferior, that they are inactive against the Japanese and that as a result
                        of their poverty they have led a very bitter existence and have been forced
                        to produce opium for shipment to occupied areas. General Hsiung said he did
                        not believe the communists could gain control of North China and Manchuria
                        when the Japanese withdraw therefrom because they lack sufficient military
                        strength and popular support and because the puppet forces under the command
                        of Wang Ching-wei, with whom the National Government is in touch, will
                        cooperate with the latter in opposing the communists.<note n="95" xml:id="d207fn95">In a memorandum dated August 13, 1943, Augustus S.
                            Chase of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs observed: “Of especial
                            interest is General Hsiung’s virtual admission that the Chungking
                            Government has an understanding with Wang Ching-wei’s puppet forces
                            which calls for joint opposition to the Communists following the
                            withdrawal of the Japanese from north China and Manchuria.”</note>

                    <p>Last night at a small informal dinner at the Statler Hotel, I sat next to
                        Major General P. T. Mow.<note n="96" xml:id="d208fn96">Of the Chinese
                            Purchasing Commission.</note> In the course of the evening Mow told a
                        story from Chinese history of one of the great states taking advantage of a
                        war between two smaller countries to allow them to exhaust themselves,
                        whereafter the great state was able to take them both over. He had spent a
                        year, he said, in Russia in 1925–26 studying military science there, and
                        speaks Russian. Russia, he asserted, was to blame for the present war.<note n="*" xml:id="d208fn99">This and other statements made by the General
                            are quoted here not because they are believed to be true—the General
                            himself must suspect the accuracy of some of them—but because of their
                            importance as the reflection of an attitude of mind.—rsw [Footnote in
                            the original.]</note> If she had not made a non-aggression pact with
                        Germany, Germany would not have dared to fight in Europe and she was, he
                        felt, to blame for Pearl Harbor also, because she had made a non-aggression
                        pact with Japan prior to the latter’s attack. Japan would never have struck
                        at the United States “if she had had to leave her back door open”.</p>
                    <p>Of lend-lease shipments to Russia by boat, he alleged that about two out of
                        five go ultimately to Japan. Japan was supplying Russia with rubber in
                        return.</p>
                    <p>General Mow went on to say that he was in Chungking when Willkie<note n="97" xml:id="d208fn97">Wendell Willkie, Republican nominee for President in
                            1940, who visited China and other countries in behalf of the war effort
                            in 1942.</note> was there; when one of the guests interrupted to ask him
                        if it was true that China was receiving as much aid from Russia as Willkie
                        said—there was supposed to have been a line of trucks fender to fender on
                        the road through Hsinkiang bringing supplies to China—Mow replied, “I don’t
                        think so. I don’t think there was a single truck. On the contrary,” he said,
                        “Russia is getting stuff from China. She wants Chinese wool.”</p>
                    <p>When Mow was last in China he went one morning to see H. H. Kung. Mr. Kung
                        was sick in bed and very angry. The Russian Ambassador<note n="98" xml:id="d208fn98">Alexander Semenovich Panyushkin.</note> had just left,
                        having insisted on seeing Kung about a very important matter which turned
                        out to be the arrangement for payment for wool purchases. The Russians were
                        determined, Mow claimed, on paying for these shipments at the New York
                        price, i. e., the lowest one, and at the official rate for Chinese currency,
                        while they themselves bought this Chinese currency on the black market in
                        China. Meanwhile, Mow claimed, for the gasoline which the Chinese were <pb n="272" xml:id="pg_272" facs="0282"/>purchasing from the Russians they
                        had to pay the current price in Chungking.</p>
                    <p>In 1938, Mow alleged, Russia had sent emissaries to Hsinkiang, where they
                        forced Sheng Shih-tsai to sign an agreement giving to Russia all the tin in
                        Hsinkiang province. Again last fall when Baku was threatened and Russia
                        thought that she was losing her oil supply, she forced Sheng to sign another
                        agreement leasing all the oil. In the negotiations for this agreement Sheng
                        wired the Generalissimo and was told that China wanted to keep on friendly
                        terms with Russia. Thereafter, however, two Russian tanks crossed the
                        Hsinkiang border, according to Mow, and Sheng, after having reported the
                        matter to Chungking, threatened to close all Russian offices in Urumchi. The
                        Russians thereafter became conciliatory and a settlement was reached, Mow
                        indicated, on a basis of a 50–50 division of the oil between Russia and
                        China.</p>
                    <p>Asked by one of the guests if he believed Russia would lend her territory to
                        the United Nations for use as air bases against Japan he replied that he
                        felt certain that she would not do so, that she had no interest in helping
                        America against Japan.</p>
                    <p>To another question as to whether he believed Russia would attempt to seize
                        Chinese territory when she was free to do so, he replied, “Sure she will.”
                        He then drew a rough sketch map of China locating the province of Hsinkiang
                        on it, and asserted that Russia planned (or was engaged in?) building air
                        fields in southern Hsinkiang from which she intended, he claimed, to attack
                        India.</p>
                    <p>He then went on to say that what Russia wanted was an outlet through the
                        Persian Gulf—that if she went through the Baltic to the English Channel she
                        would just be going through the English Channel (by which he meant that the
                        channel would always be controlled by England) and that by going out through
                        Vladivostok she would just be going through the Sea of Japan. At the
                        Bosporus there was Turkey (barring the way). But the Persian Gulf was
                        relatively more open, and (according to Mow) until she was attacked by
                        Germany “Russia hoped that an Axis victory would give her the Persian
                        Gulf.”</p>
                    <p>General Mow also said that Russia had shown her hand in her attack on Finland
                        and Poland, and if she had just been able to restrain herself in Bessarabia
                        her plans would have worked out, but she moved too rapidly.</p>
                    <p>Russia’s real object, according to Mow, was the spread of the doctrines of
                        Communism. She wanted to make, he said, all other countries Communistic. The
                        dissolution of the Comintern meant nothing; Russia no longer needed it: “The
                        glass was already cracked.”</p>
                    <p>General Mow claimed that a ranking American officer who had recently returned
                        from Chungking had predicted that Russia would <pb n="273" xml:id="pg_273" facs="0283"/>show a definite interest in Northern Manchuria at the close
                        of the war, and he recalled that when Matsuoka left Moscow after signing a
                        nonaggression pact with Russia, Stalin saw him off at the station. That was,
                        he said, a very rare thing and indicated how Russia felt toward Japan.</p>
                    <p>In comment on these observations three things may be noted—first, General Mow
                        comes from Fenghua, General Chiang Kai-shek’s home town. He attended the
                        Whampoa Academy in Canton when Chiang was its president, and after Chiang
                        came back from Moscow he went there. These associations with the
                        Generalissimo are sufficiently close to suggest that Mow probably reflects
                        the point of view of an influential group in the Chinese Army if not in fact
                        that of the Generalissimo himself.</p>
                    <p>A second point of importance is the fact that all through the evening General
                        Mow talked as if he considered Russia China’s enemy rather than Japan. An
                        outsider, listening to the conversation, would not have imagined that the
                        guests were all of them nationals of countries at war with Japan; he would
                        have concluded that Russia was the antagonist.</p>
                    <p>The third point of almost equal significance was the sympathy with which
                        General Mow’s remarks were received by the other guests. Everyone present
                        except myself expressed at one point or another the heartiest approval of
                        the General’s statements. As an instance of this feeling, another of the
                        guests, a high ranking officer of a wartime agency in Washington, expressed
                        relief that a shortage of shipping would delay some of the lend-lease
                        supplies which were going to Russia.</p>

                    <p>1066. Embassy’s 1012, June 24, 2 p.m. In a despatch dated June 14 the Embassy
                        officer at Sian reports information received from informed local military
                        officials confirmatory of previous reports that there are large
                        concentrations of Chinese troops at [<hi rend="italic">in</hi>] Shensi,
                        Honan and Kansu provinces; that the function of these troops is, in addition
                        to guarding against Japanese incursion, the enforcement of a blockade
                        against Chinese Communists in North Shensi; that the troop concentrations
                        extend from Tungkwan, Honan province, southwestward through Sian and in a
                        semi-circle into eastern Kansu at least as far as Kuyuan (east of Lanchow);
                        that in the north the Communists are contained by Ninghsia Provincial and
                        National Government <pb n="274" xml:id="pg_274" facs="0284"/>troops; and
                        that the blockade maintained against the Communist area is apparently as
                        stringent as ever.</p>
                    <p>According to the informants cited, the Communists control all of Shansi north
                        of Taiyuan except for some towns and lines of communications. The informants
                        admitted the Communists have not recently clashed with Central Government
                        troops and made the familiar accusation that the Communists employ unfair
                        method in expanding the area under their control. One of the informants
                        stated that there had been minor withdrawals of Japanese troops from Shansi
                        and replacement of them by puppet forces with which the Central Government
                        forces were in “constant contact”.</p>

                            printed, but see despatch No. 11, June 5, from the Consul at Tihwa to
                            the Chargé in China, <ref target="#pg_249">p. 249</ref>.</note> In a
                        despatch of June 15, Clubb at Tihwa reports that the Governor of Sinkiang
                        has informed him that roughly three-fifths of the Soviet troops formerly
                        stationed in the province had already reached the Soviet Union; that
                        one-fifth were in movement toward the Sinkiang-Russian border; that the
                        remaining fifth were temporarily in Hami; and that the Russian Air Force
                        planes had not yet left and would probably comprise the last unit of the
                        Soviet military establishment to depart. Governor Sheng stated also that all
                        of the Soviet military and technical advisers had left Tihwa and that while
                        some were still in other points in the province awaiting transportation they
                        had ceased functioning.</p>
                    <p>According to the special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs at Tihwa, the
                        Soviet troops and advisers were being withdrawn upon initiative of the USSR
                        Government. The Commissioner stated that the Chinese had not requested that
                        the Soviet troops be withdrawn and had in fact, upon learning of the
                        proposed withdrawal of the advisers, endeavored to persuade the Soviet
                        Government to continue the latter in service in Sinkiang. The Commissioner
                        added that the advisers, whose number he gave as 112 for the entire
                        province, had not exercised any political authority in Sinkiang.</p>

                        <item>During the recent negotiations at Chungking Chiang Kai-shek offered
                            Chou and General Lin Piao, Communist representative from Yenan, terms as
                            follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>The Communist Party to be accorded legal status with the right to
                                    establish its party organization throughout China provided it
                                    gives up its border government at Yenan and the district
                                    governments under its control and places its army under the
                                    command of the Central Government. (Communist army units would
                                    then be scattered throughout Free China.) Chiang requested that
                                    he be given an answer by the end of August and stated that in
                                    the absence of acceptance by the Communist Party he would be
                                    forced to take “appropriate steps”. The People’s Political
                                    Council is scheduled to meet in September and if the Communist
                                    Party rejects the proposed terms the Council is expected to
                                    issue a statement denouncing the Communists for their
                                    obstructive tactics.</p>

                        <item>The Communist Party is adopting a firm stand and it is unlikely that
                            it will accept these terms. Future developments will then depend largely
                            upon the international situation. If the Burma Road is reopened and the
                            Central Government’s army received sufficient equipment to enable it to
                            become a factor in driving the Japs from China, Chungking should be able
                            to regain possession of the North China area. The Communists would then
                            be in no position to oppose strong Central Government forces and the
                            Kuomintang-Communist problem would no longer exist (by inference the
                            Communists would be liquidated). If the Central Government troops are
                            not sufficiently well equipped to become a factor in the defeat of Japan
                            and if Jap withdrawals from China are caused by pressure from American
                            and British naval and other forces, the Chungking Government will not be
                            sufficiently strong to reoccupy North China and will instead be faced
                            with a Communist occupation of that area and Manchuria. The Central
                            Government would then not wish to bring matters to a head by attacking
                            the Communists for fear of criticism that it had fomented civil war in
                            China. The Communist Party would be well advised to accept Chiang’s
                            proposals as it then would gain the good will of the people through this
                            evidence of its willingness to cooperate for unity.</item>

                    <p>2. The informant is strongly nationalistic and his views may be assumed to
                        represent at least partially those of the Chungking Government. They are at
                        any rate indicative of the intention of the Kuomintang to obtain by one
                        means or the other the removal of the Communists as a factor of any
                        importance in China and in some respects they support the contention of the
                        Communists that the Central Government’s appeals for military aid derive as
                        much from the Government’s desire to liquidate the Communist army as they do
                        from a desire to defeat the Japanese.</p>

                                Teh, Commander-in-Chief [of] Communist area, sent on July 4th to
                                General Hu in which Chu warns of the harmful results of civil war
                                and protests against massing of Central Government troops in this
                                area. (The informant states that there were already approximately 14
                                divisions of Central Government troops in that region and that the
                                troops of General Yen Hsi-shan are stationed east of this area in
                                Shansi.) The Communist Party representatives at Chungking have sent
                                a copy of this telegram to General Chang Chih-chung, Director of the
                                Political Training Board of Ministry of Military Administration, and
                                to Dr. Wang Shih-chieh, Chief Secretary General of the People’s
                                Political Council. The Communist newspaper at Chungking was not
                                permitted to publish the message of the Communist Party prepared for
                                the double seventh (July 7) special edition. Generals Chou and Lin
                                Piao whose plans for a return to Yenan were reported in Embassy’s
                                1012, June 24, 2 p.m., are now somewhere between Kwangyuan (north

                                (railhead in Shensi) en route to Sian. It is not believed that they
                                are aware of these developments although Chou prior to his departure
                                from Chungking predicted that the Central Government might be
                                expected to exert pressure of this sort in order to settle
                                Kuomintang-Communist differences.</item>

                            <item>While Chiang Kai-shek’s permission must have been obtained for the

                                with Communists, there is a possible danger that the situation may
                                develop along lines similar to those at time of the New Fourth Army
                                incident in January 1941 when local commanders of Central Government
                                troops acted against the Communist troops without prior reference to
                                the Chungking authorities.</item>

                            <item>The Central Government feels that it is in position to “blackmail”
                                its allies in the matter—that is, the Central Government considers
                                that it can adopt an openly harsh attitude against Communists
                                without risk of open criticism or interference by China’s allies
                                because of the latter’s fear of giving offense or of injuring their
                                relations with China in any way which might adversely affect the
                                Central Government’s willingness to keep at war with Japan.
                                American, British and Russian failure to interfere with such action
                                by the Chinese Government would be in the nature of a “concession”
                                in order to keep China in the war. Soviet Russia has in a sense made
                                one such concession by its withdrawal from Sinkiang. The Communist
                                Party would also be compelled to make concessions of some kind in
                                order to prevent civil war and in order to avoid condemnation by
                                United Nations. General Chiang probably feels that the dissolution
                                of Comintern has given the Kuomintang a freer hand with the
                                Communists and this feeling together with the above described
                                situation has resulted in his stronger attitude toward the
                                Communists. Pressure on Communists for their acceptance of
                                Kuomintang terms may be expected to continue and perhaps to grow
                                stronger.</item>

                            Central Government plans to utilize the opportunity offered by the
                            dissolution of the Comintern to attack the Communists. You have brought
                            many troops from Honan and are sending ammunition and food to this area.
                            Since your arrival in the Lochwan–Ichun area there have been many
                            evidences of military activity. You have urged your generals to make
                            preparations for an attack. There is danger that civil war may break out
                            at any time. At a time when our war against Japan is at a difficult
                            stage, everything should be done to maintain unity. National unity and
                            national resistance would suffer irreparable harm from a civil war which
                            will benefit only Japan. This unexpected change in the situation <pb n="279" xml:id="pg_279" facs="0289"/>has greatly surprised us and
                            leaves us in doubt. Please reply. <hi rend="italic">End

                    <p>We have been reliably informed that Chu again despatched the telegram to Hu
                        on July 6 as he had not at that time received a reply.</p>
                    <p>3. Although this situation undoubtedly has serious aspects, the Embassy is of
                        the opinion that the Central Government is not likely under present
                        circumstances to undertake direct military action against the Communists,
                        first, in general, because of the adverse reaction which could be expected
                        to result among the United Nations, particularly in the United States and
                        Britain, upon whom China depends for the defeat of Japan, direct military
                        aid and assistance in Chinese postwar reconstruction plans; and, second,
                        specifically because of the effect on Chinese relations with Soviet Russia
                        and Chinese continuing hopes that Russia will eventually enter the war as an
                        ally of China against Japan. It seems improbable that the Kuomintang leaders
                        will wish to be responsible in the eyes of the United Nations for causing
                        civil war, and the reported massing of Central Government troops would
                        appear to be a form of pressure upon the Communists to accept Kuomintang
                        terms which is not intended to extend to the point of actual conflict.</p>

                        1312 of June 30, 1943, concerning conditions in Shensi Province, there is
                        enclosed a copy of a memorandum<note n="2" xml:id="d215fn2">Not
                            printed.</note> of conversation with Dr. Basu, a member of the Indian
                        Medical Unit in China, in regard to conditions in the Communist-controlled
                        areas in north China.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Basu is a member of the Indian Medical Unit sent to China by the Indian
                        National Congress Medical Union in 1938. Following the fall of Hankow in
                        October 1938 and the subsequent threat to Ichang, the group proceeded under
                        orders of the Chinese Army Medical Corps to the north China area where it
                        remained until the time of the New Fourth Army Incident in January 1941 when
                        the Indian National Congress, at the request of the Central Government,
                        recalled the Unit to India. Dr. Basu, who was then in the Wutaishan area,
                        did not receive the orders for his recall until a later date and, feeling
                        that his services were badly needed by the Communist troops in that area,
                        did not leave north China until May 1943.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="pg_280" facs="0290"/>
                    <p>Dr. Basu states that economic conditions in the Communist-controlled areas
                        are now considerably better than in 1942 and that the general price level is
                        about half that obtaining at Chungking. The serious shortage of many
                        commodities and foodstuffs in 1942 impelled the Border Government
                        (Communist) at Yenan to release all government officials, except the most
                        essential, and many of the troops for service in industrial and agricultural
                        productive units. Central Government troops maintain a fairly effective
                        blockade of the Communist-controlled areas which is directed particularly
                        toward preventing cotton and iron from reaching the Communists. Some
                        supplies of these materials do, however, get through the blockade, perhaps
                        with the connivance of the Central Government troops.</p>
                    <p>The Communist troops are said by Dr. Basu to confine their military
                        operations against the Japanese to defensive action as they are not
                        sufficiently well-equipped to assume the offensive. The Communists pay
                        particular attention to the establishment of strong bases, economically and
                        politically, in the areas which they occupy, for without the support of the
                        people it is impossible for them to operate behind the enemy lines. As
                        evidence of the popular support the Communists enjoy he cites many
                        Communist-controlled areas behind Japanese lines and points out that Central
                        Government troops are not found in such areas chiefly because their
                        oppression of the people deprives them of the support of the people
                        necessary for their existence in those areas. Political support of the
                        people is obtained through the establishment of representative governments
                        in Communist-occupied districts which are elected by the vote of the people
                        and in which the Communist representation is limited to one-third, the
                        remaining two-thirds being shared by Kuomintang members and non-party
                        persons. Economically, the Communists encourage the organization of
                        cooperatives and home industries which prevent raw materials, particularly
                        cotton in the Communist areas in Hopei, reaching the Japanese and provide
                        commodities for the people.</p>
                    <p>The absence of any comment on the part of Dr. Basu critical of Communist
                        activities is perhaps partially the natural result of four years’ work in
                        the Communist areas among people with whom he may feel sympathetic from the
                        standpoint of a person who himself opposes in India a ruling class. (He
                        claims, however, that he is a member of the Indian National Congress Party
                        and not a Communist.) At the same time, it is worth noting that all foreign
                        observers (and the majority have not been Communists) who have lived or
                        traveled in the Communist-controlled areas in recent years have had much the
                        same reaction to Communist activities there as that of Dr. Basu. There is
                        doubtless a studied effort on the part of the Communists to show foreigners
                        only the favorable side of the situation there, but one cannot escape the
                        conclusion that, without regard to the ultimate <pb n="281" xml:id="pg_281" facs="0291"/>aims of the Communist Party in China, the Communists are
                        following a policy which has increased their standing among the majority of
                        people in the areas which they control.<note n="3" xml:id="d215fn3">
                     <p>In a
                                memorandum dated August 10, Augustus S. Chase of the Division of Far
                                Eastern Affairs made the following comment:</p>
                            <p>“There is little new information in the memorandum, but the following
                                points are perhaps of especial interest:</p>
                            <p>“Despite the Central Government’s blockade of the Communist areas,
                                some wool and iron get through to the Communists, perhaps with the
                                connivance of the Central Government troops. As far as Dr. Basu
                                knows, there is no truth in the charges that the Communists are
                                cultivating opium in Shensi. The Communist Army’s spirit is
                                superlative. Its total strength is about 500,000–600,000. Increased
                                production has solved the Communists’ food problems. The chief
                                problem is an acute lack of medicines. The Communists manufacture
                                their own mortars and rifles from steel rails taken from
                                Japanese-controlled railways. They can carry on defensive war
                                indefinitely.”</p>

                    <p>1136. Embassy’s 1125, July 8, noon. Admiral Yang, Chief of Chinese
                        Intelligence, has been very helpful to our Naval and Military Attachés and
                        has inspired them with confidence in his judgment and in the general
                        accuracy of his statements (he frequently contradicts those of the military
                        spokesman). He is often called upon in high places to give the determining
                        opinion in regard to developments. My personal relations with him are in
                        nature of those of an old friend of many years standing. We accordingly
                        consider that information and comment from him are worth attention.</p>
                    <p>I have had opportunity to mention to him casually that we have heard rumors
                        of possible trouble with Chinese Communists. He confirmed the report that
                        considerable bodies of troops had been moved into Shensi but stated
                        categorically that Central Government forces had no intention of attacking
                        Communists. He said that Government felt that “blockade” was necessary to
                        prevent expansion by Communist troops and border government and that there
                        was no question that the Communists continued to be under influence from
                        Moscow, thus incidentally throwing into relief the continuing suspicions of
                        Russian motives which exist in many important quarters here. He expressed
                        the opinion that an open Kuomintang-Communist conflict would not occur at
                        any time pending conclusion of the war but intimated that he felt such
                        conflict was almost inevitable after the war.</p>

                    <p>838. Department’s 455, June 18, 9 p.m., regarding attitude of Soviet press
                        toward Chinese Communists since dissolution of Comintern.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Red Star</hi> for July 7th published a 4–column survey by
                        Colonel Tolcgevov[<hi rend="italic">Tolchenov</hi>] of 6 years of the
                        Sino-Japanese war. This is the only Soviet press item appearing in recent
                        months to the Embassy’s knowledge pertinent to the Department’s inquiry.</p>
                    <p>Most of the article factually summarizes the results of military operations
                        during the war. Events are periodized into two phases. In the first, to the
                        fall of 1938, Japan was on the offensive in China. Since then Japan has been
                        able to launch only limited operations.</p>
                    <p>The conclusion is reached that Japan failed to achieve her objective in China
                        despite her advantages largely because the Chinese people achieved “unity of
                        all the national forces of the country” against the threat to their
                        political existence.</p>
                    <p>With the beginning of the Pacific war “the struggle in China became one of
                        many fronts of the world war.” The Chinese aid to the British at Hong Kong
                        and in Burma is referred to. The loss of Burma is described as a grievous
                        blow to China cutting her off from almost all help from her American and
                        British allies.</p>
                    <p>The article points out, however, that China’s general military situation has
                        now improved since Japan is forced to concentrate her main forces in the
                        Pacific and is not in a position to undertake large scale operations in the
                        Chinese theater which is for Japan “of secondary significance.”</p>
                    <p>The article refers frequently to the Chinese partisans. It regards their
                        activities as a major factor making for successful Chinese resistance.
                        Moreover, it declares that in the hinterland of much of the Japanese
                        occupied territory the Chinese Government is still functioning “under the
                        protection of partisan detachments.”</p>
                    <p>The article is extremely cautious regarding political matters. Its omissions,
                        however, may be significant. Thus, no credit for Chinese success is given to
                        Chiang Kai Shek or other political leaders, none of whom are even mentioned.
                        At the same time no political characterization of the partisans is
                        attempted. To the improvements in the Chinese Army’s tactics is attributed
                        part of China’s success. There is no explicit condemnation of Japan, but the
                        pro-Chinese bias of the article is obvious.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="pg_283" facs="0293"/>
                    <p>The article pays tribute to the Chinese people. It refers to the partisans
                        after 1938 as embracing “ever broader masses of the Chinese people.”</p>
                    <p>It concludes, “The Chinese people continue courageously to fight for its
                        liberty and national independence.”</p>

                    <p>1173. Embassy’s 1136, July 9, 4 p.m. According to Admiral Yang, Chou En-lai
                        is now in Sian talking with General Hu Tsung-nan. Admiral Yang continues in
                        his opinion that fighting will not break out as the Government realized that
                        hostilities are not desirable from its point of view and as the Communists
                        are not strong enough to take offensive action. He stated that, however,
                        “some” Central Government troops have been moved into position as a
                        precautionary measure.</p>
                    <p>According to Communist sources here, Central Government troops at one place
                        recently fired several rounds of trench mortar shells at Communist outposts
                        and were engaged in making reconnaissance of the topography of the
                        region.</p>

                    <p>1183. Embassy’s 1173, July 13, 4 p.m., and previous. A Counselor of Soviet
                        Embassy together with a Press Attaché of the Embassy, who acted as
                        interpreter, called on me this morning “to exchange views” in regard to the
                        Kuomintang-Communist situation. From his remarks it appears that the
                        information in possession of the Soviet Embassy on recent developments is
                        similar to ours, except the Counselor stated that Central Government troops
                        had within the last few days fired on Communist outposts or positions in as
                        many as 10 different places. He expressed the opinion that Chinese
                        Government by moving more forces to the “border” area were probably hoping
                        to exert pressure on Communists to accept Generalissimo’s terms and that
                        Government realized that it would not be desirable, from the point of view
                        of China’s international relations, to launch military attack <pb n="284" xml:id="pg_284" facs="0294"/>upon the Communist forces at this time. He
                        expressed apprehension, however, lest civil war break out as a result of
                        possible independent action by individual Central Government troop
                        commanders and said that, according to his Embassy’s information, the
                        situation along the “border” was “very tense”.</p>
                    <p>This approach by Soviet Counselor seems to us to be of interest,
                        incidentally, because it is the first time within our recollection that
                        Soviet Embassy has so unequivocally shown concern in the fortunes of Chinese
                        Communists and because of the seriousness with which Soviet Embassy
                        apparently regards the recent developments. We for our part are still of the
                        opinion that Chinese Government is not deliberately planning to resolve the
                        issue by resort to arms, but that there exists and will continue to exist so
                        long as Central Government maintains large troop concentrations in the
                        so-called “border area” a possibility that there may be precipitated some
                        incident which conceivably might have very unfortunate results.</p>
                    <p>When occasion has arisen in private informal conversation with Chinese
                        officials we have, of course, expressed the opinion that the outbreak of
                        anything in the nature of a civil war in China would be most unfortunate; we
                        do not, however, believe that it would be advisable or productive for us
                        here to make any direct approach in the matter at this time. We have the
                        impression that General Stilwell has endeavored for a long time to persuade
                        the Chinese military authorities to move Hu Tsung-nan’s troops, which are
                        considered to be among the best and the best equipped of the Chinese Army to
                        Yunnan or some other area where they might contribute something to the war
                        effort, but the Chinese Government (the Generalissimo and his reactionary
                        supporters) have remained adamant and are and will continue to be relentless
                        in their efforts to eliminate the Communist question if they can do so
                        without forcing the issue to the extent of open hostilities. (There are now
                        possibly more than 400,000 Central Government troops in the “border” area
                        and while the region is, of course, an important sector of defense against
                        possible Japanese attack, even Chinese Intelligence officers admit that the
                        immobilization there of such large numbers of superior troops is not
                        justified for that purpose alone.</p>
                    <p>I would venture the opinion that a possibly effective way of influencing the
                        Chinese Government in this matter (as well as in other matters) would be to
                        furnish China with considerably increased air and other military aid (if
                        this is practicable) or categorically to promise additional and precisely
                        specified aid at a fixed date, and at the same time make it clear that such
                        aid is furnished in the definite expectation that the Chinese Government by
                        appropriate use of its troops and other resources would launch itself with
                        determination into the war against Japan.</p>

                    <p>In assessing the real importance of Communism (Stalinism) in China a person
                        may often be led into error by oversimplification and by sentiment over the
                        alleged idyllic existence in the area dominated by Chinese Communists.</p>
                    <p>In the first place, China belongs in that category of colonial or dependent
                        countries with a scant percentage of skilled workers. As a colonial or
                        dependent country the system of orthodox Marxism is not applicable and the
                        various congresses of the Communist International have laid down programs
                        for work in such countries giving wide latitude and great flexibility to the
                        tactics to be applied. The principal objective always seems to have been to
                        swing the communist elements in the countries concerned into the orbit of
                        Moscow and to make as one of the fundamental duties of those alien
                        Communists allegiance to the Soviet Union, in this respect to force their
                        respective countries to subscribe wholeheartedly to Soviet foreign policy
                        vis-à-vis any other country in the world. Because of the wide latitude given
                        communist leaders in colonial countries a neutral observer can easily be
                        mistaken with regard to the program and role of these parties.
                        Superficially, they do appear to be moderate agrarian parties with a
                        moderate program. The test to be applied, however, is how these leaders
                        stand on various questions.</p>
                    <p>One would normally expect patriotic nationalist Chinese to be insistent upon
                        major emphasis being given the war against Japan. Not so the Chinese
                        communist leaders. The Chinese Communists saw nothing wrong in the German
                        Soviet pact. On the contrary, the Chinese Communists echoed the sentiments
                        of Communists throughout the world. To them the war was an imperialist war,
                        with the United States and Great Britain as much at fault as Germany. Even
                        after the entrance of the United States into the war the Chinese Communists
                        have deliberately played up the major role of the Soviet Union and have
                        minimized the efforts of both Britain and the United States. The Chinese
                        Communists have never insisted upon major emphasis in the Pacific area and
                        when Pearl Buck,<note n="4" xml:id="d220fn4">American novelist writing
                            principally on Chinese subjects.</note> in a speech last November or
                        December, suggested that more attention might be given that area she was
                        made the object of a smear campaign by American Communists, and, so far as
                        is known, no Chinese Communist <pb n="286" xml:id="pg_286" facs="0296"/>has
                        ever come to her defense. Their whole line seems to be oriented along Soviet
                        lines, rather than along Chinese lines essentially. It should not be
                        overlooked either that the principal reporter for the past ten years on
                        colonial questions has been a person known as Wang Ming, located in Moscow,
                        who has faithfully reflected Stalin’s views.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the Kremlin itself, there is too much of a tendency to regard
                        the Soviet Union’s chief immediate interest in China, so far as active
                        interference is concerned, as having terminated in 1927. That is a grave
                        mistake. Ample evidence exists to show that after the debacle in 1927 the
                        interest of the Communist International and the Red International of Trade
                        Unions continued actively, with principal emphasis on the presence in China,
                        as communists agents, of nationals of other countries, especially persons
                        bearing American passports. It is ironical, of course, that in the fall of
                        1927 Earl Browder,<note n="5" xml:id="d220fn5">Later General Secretary of
                            the Communist Party in the United States.</note> Tom Mann, the
                        Englishman, and Jacques Doriot (then a French communist, now a Nazi puppet
                        in France) toured China, inciting the Chinese against the foreign element.
                        After that junket foreign agents were used by the Soviets. The raid of June
                        15, 1931 at Shanghai showed that active agents of the Communist
                        International and of the Red International of Labor Unions had been
                        operating from Shanghai for a number of years, not only against Chiang
                        Kai-shek but also stirring up trouble against the United States and Great
                        Britain and the Netherlands in the Far East. The budget showed that over a
                        half million dollars a year was being spent. The leader of this group was a
                        prominent Russian Soviet agent who assumed the identities of persons known
                        as Noulens and Ruegg. His principal assistant bore an American passport in
                        the name of Stewart. This man actually was Charles Krumbein, an American
                        citizen, who is today one of the most prominent persons in the Communist
                        Party of the United States.</p>
                    <p>Others active there were James Dolsen, Earl Browder’s cousin, and Margaret
                        Cowl, both American citizens. It appears that this raid temporarily broke up
                        the foreign connections of the Chinese Communist movement, but in 1932 a
                        prominent German Communist, Arthur Ewert, bearing an American passport in
                        the name of Harry Berger and accompanied by another person bearing an
                        American passport in the name of Walsh were in China intermittently between
                        1932 and 1933 attempting to reestablish contacts. (Ewert is now serving a
                        sentence of fifteen years in Brazil as one of the chief leaders of the
                        revolution in Brazil in November 1935). Even after 1932 there is evidence
                        available showing that the Kremlin, using American citizens and dummy
                        American firms, maintained active interest in covering conditions in China.
                        Consequently, it is correct in stating <pb n="287" xml:id="pg_287" facs="0297"/>that the open Moscow maneuvers in China ceased in 1927, but
                        it should always be borne in mind that their undercover clandestine efforts
                        continued unremittingly thereafter.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Communist Party is in very close touch with the Communist Party
                        of the United States. The dissolution of the Communist International has in
                        no wise changed the fundamental program of either Party. One of the chief
                        sources for the conveyance of news regarding China throughout this
                        Hemisphere is the Inter-continent News Agency at New York headed by Grace
                        Maul Granich, who, it may be recalled, operated, with her husband, an
                        especially virulent communist monthly at Shanghai in 1935 after Harold
                        Isaac’s venture had been abandoned. Grace Maul Granich is, in turn, the
                        American agent for the Soviet Information Bureau which was started about May
                        1942 by Third Assistant Commissar of Foreign Affairs, Lozovsky, and is
                        further regarded as one of the organs to take the place of the Communist
                        International.</p>
                    <p>It is entirely conjectural, of course, but if Moscow feels it in her interest
                        to bring about a cessation to the Japanese-Chinese war it is reasonable to
                        believe the Chinese Communist Party will fall in line, likewise, the
                        Communist Party of the United States. Both are creatures of Moscow today.
                        Neither has ever taken a step contrary to the interests of the Kremlin.
                        There is one school of thought which has made a close study of Soviet
                        foreign policy, which is of the opinion that the Soviets’ ultimate objective
                        was the exclusion of the remainder of the white race from the Far East.
                        Basic documents exist to substantiate this belief. It is known, however,
                        that for short-range purposes the Soviets are guided principally by
                        expedience, if it is in their interest, in the hope of securing major
                        credits for the reconstruction of the Soviet Union. To remain friendly with
                        the United States she may do nothing in the Far East. On the other hand, if
                        she feels that the United States is in no position to help her after the
                        conclusion of the war with Japan, she may strike out on the line long
                        advocated by Lenin and subscribed to at times by Stalin, which is the
                        exclusion of other white nations from the Far East.</p>
                    <p>If it is thought that the rank and file of the Chinese Communists can be won
                        over from the leadership of Mao Tse Tsung and Chu Teh, it may be worthwhile
                        to try it, but it will be a very difficult task. Probably the greatest
                        missionaries for this purpose would be American soldiers themselves who,
                        upon coming into direct contact with these elements, would prove by their
                        example that all the propaganda and indoctrination of Communists that the
                        United States is an imperialist, self-seeking nation was fabricated.</p>
                    <p>A very ominous note with regard to future Soviet relations with Chiang
                        Kai-shek is contained in a telegram from the American <pb n="288" xml:id="pg_288" facs="0298"/>Embassy at Moscow, no. 838 of July 10,
                        noon, which summarizes an article by a Soviet spokesman from the very
                        authoritative <hi rend="italic">Red Star</hi> for July 7, with regard to the
                        Japanese-Chinese war. Principal credit for the resistance of the Chinese is
                        attributed to the “partisans”, another name for the Communists, and no
                        credit is given to Chiang Kai-shek or other political leaders. This pattern
                        is similar to the preliminary one undertaken against General Mikhailovitch
                        of Yugoslavia in July 1942. Since that time bitter attacks have been made
                        against Mikhailovitch on the grounds that he is an Italian agent.
                        Practically all derogatory information from Soviet sources has been
                        distributed in the United States through the Intercontinent News Agency.</p>

                    <p>1214. 1. The secretary of Chou En-lai, Communist Party representative at
                        Chungking, has furnished an officer of the Embassy the following information
                        regarding Communist-Kuomintang developments in addition to that reported in
                        Embassy’s 1183, July 14, noon.</p>

                        <item>On July 9 General Hu Tsung-nan replied to General Chu Teh’s message
                            (Embassy’s 1125, July 8, noon) stating that the transfer of Chungking
                            troops from Honan to the Central Government-Communist border regions in
                            Shensi is not for the purpose of commencing military operations against
                            the Communists but merely represents the sending of his second line
                            troops to that area to relieve troops already stationed there. (The
                            informant does not believe that there has been any withdrawals of
                            Chungking troops from the region in question.) Hu also explained that he
                            had gone to the Lochwan area to carry out a routine inspection of his
                            troops. Chou and Lin Piao after being entertained by Hu at Sian departed
                            for Yenan on July 13 with the convoy of 4 trucks with which they left
                            Chungking and which had undergone a rigorous inspection at Paochi,
                            Shensi. General Chang Chih-chung, head of the military training board,
                            has denied to the Communists at Chungking that there have been any
                            Chungking troop concentrations in Shensi.</item>

                        <item>Chiang Kai-shek suddenly called a meeting of the Standing Committee of
                            the People’s Political Council at Chungking on July 13 at which he
                            stated the constitutional government would be established by the Central
                            Government before the end of the war on two conditions: (1) “unification
                            of military orders” (all armed forces under one command) and (2)
                            “unification of governmental orders” <pb n="289" xml:id="pg_289" facs="0299"/>(all governmental authority under one head). There was
                            no discussion of these points by the members of the committee present
                            among whom was a Communist representative. [(]Chou is expected to return
                            to Chungking in time for the meeting of the People’s Political Council
                            scheduled for mid-September.) These points do not represent any general
                            change in Chiang’s attitude toward the Communists although it is the
                            first time he has mentioned constitutional government since 1941. No
                            change in the general situation is to be expected although the
                            Communists are willing to make some concessions such as giving up the
                            border government at Yenan provided the local officials at the present
                            Communist controlled districts are either Communists or Kuomintang
                            officials friendly to the Communists. While Soviet Russia is sympathetic
                            toward the Chinese Communists, there is no direct connection between the
                            Chinese Communist Party and the Soviet Government and the latter is not
                            giving any form of aid to the Chinese Communists.</item>

                    <p>2. It is not believed that the foregoing circumstances indicate any
                        definitive change in the situation except that the recent tension is perhaps
                        abating. Chiang’s reference to constitutional government may be merely a
                        buildup for the issuance of a manifesto by the PPC when it meets in
                        September with a view to throwing the blame on the Communists for failure to
                        reach a settlement of Kuomintang-Communist differences. Dr. Sun Fo (whose
                        leanings are in general liberal) stated to me privately last evening his
                        opinion, which tends to be in confirmation of ours, that the Chungking troop
                        concentrations in the “border area” are for purposes of pressure on the
                        Communists and that hostilities are not likely to result.</p>

                                Attaché, Major General Kuo Teh-chuan, says that during the year he
                                has been in the Soviet Union he has seen no reference whatever to
                                the Chinese Communists in the Russian press. Insofar as he has been
                                able to ascertain they have during this period had no representative
                                in Kuibyshev or Moscow. He does not think the Chinese Communists are
                                longer receiving supplies from the Russians. <pb n="290" xml:id="pg_290" facs="0300"/>He knows that no supplies are

                                radical change in Soviet policy toward China, citing as evidence

                    <p>1240. 1. Chungking correspondent <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
                        informs us Chang Tao-fan, Information Minister, asked him call July 17
                        connection with despatch filed by the correspondent subject
                        Kuomintang-Communist differences reported Embassy 1214, July 17, 6 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] p.m. During 3½ hours’ conversation, Minister
                        described in detail “history” of Chinese Communist Party; stated Communists
                        had always been guilty of pillaging, murdering Chinese people, rebellion
                        against Government and oppression of people, alleged present Communist
                        activities not different materially from those past. Chang also accused
                        Communists of attacking Central Government troops from rear when latter
                        fighting Japs and of seizing arms and supplies from Central Government
                        troops. In conclusion he asked correspondent withdraw despatch as it likely
                        to create in United States misunderstanding of true situation regarding
                        Kuomintang-Communist differences.</p>
                    <p>According correspondent, this despatch referred return Chou En-lai to Yenan
                        and possibility settlement differences between the two parties and described
                        viewpoints of the two parties regards issues between them. Despatch
                        subsequently withdrawn by correspondent who now plans rewrite it in hope
                        having it passed by censors.</p>
                    <p>The correspondent is of opinion as result this conversation with Chang that
                        there is no hope of Kuomintang-Communist settlement and that attempted
                        liquidation of Communists by one means or other inevitable after war.</p>
                    <p>2. During July 7 press conference Chang Tao-fan informed correspondents that
                        Chou En-lai was returning Yenan order settle differences between two
                        factions within Communist Party which had <pb n="291" xml:id="pg_291" facs="0301"/>arisen after dissolution Comintern. Stated one faction
                        Nationalist and favored compromise with Chungking Government while other
                        favored continuation party’s previous policy. Questioned regarding reported
                        Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, Chang denied any negotiation, stating
                        might as well expect Democratic and Republican Parties in United States to
                        enter negotiations.</p>
                    <p>3. Monitoring reports of Domei Chinese service from Chungking [by] OWI
                        representative contain rather detailed coverage present Kuomintang-Communist
                        relations, full of obvious inaccuracies (such as that Communists have given
                        up their border government at Yenan) and have strong anti-Communist
                        tone.</p>
                    <p>4. Drumright at Sian offers his opinion telegram of July 16 that doubtful
                        that Chungking policy of blockade will at present change into policy attack
                        Sian [as] press and cultural organizations reported urging since dissolution
                        Comintern, disbandment Chinese Communist Party. Further information expected
                        from Drumright in due course.</p>

                        official that Dr. T. V. Soong has telegraphed here saying that officials of

                        and had expressed to him the opinion that an open clash would be seriously

                    <p>1256. 1. In telegram from Sian dated July 19 Drumright states Civil Affairs
                        Commissioner informed him that day that prior to the departure of Lin Piao
                        and Chou En-lai from Sian for Yenan the Commissioner had discussions with
                        them, during which the attitude <pb n="292" xml:id="pg_292" facs="0302"/>of
                        the two Communist leaders was one of cooperation and helpfulness. The
                        Commissioner further stated that Chou and Lin are not returning with any
                        definite proposals but that they will confer with Communist leaders in Yenan
                        in regard future organization of the Communist Party and possibility of its
                        being dissolved. While the Commissioner confirmed reports of considerable
                        Chungking troop concentrations in the border regions, he described as
                        incorrect the recent rumors of major clashes, admitting at the same time
                        that there have been frequent small scale incidents. The Commissioner did
                        not believe that the Chungking authorities would use armed force against the
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Commissioner stated that recent reports from Chinese Intelligence have it
                        that three groups have arisen at Yenan since the dissolution of the
                        Comintern. One group favors following a policy of revolution; the second
                        group favors cooperation by an independent Chinese Communist party with the
                        Central Government; and the third group proposes that the Communist Party be
                        amalgamated with the Kuomintang. The Commissioner felt that the dissolution
                        of the Comintern had shaken the Chinese Communist Party and that numbers of
                        its members have been leaving the party. The Commissioner did not, however,
                        believe that the Communists would give up their border government at Yenan
                        of their own free will.</p>
                    <p>2. The Commissioner’s final statement gives further evidence of the belief
                        existing in Kuomintang circles (Embassy’s 1240, July 21, 9 a.m.) that the
                        Chungking Government does not consider it possible to come to any compromise
                        agreement with the Communist Party, and that the Kuomintang is determined
                        eventually to liquidate the situation.</p>

                    <p>1276. A further telegram from Drumright at Sian dated July 20 reports
                        confirmation by a recent Chinese arrival from Sanyuan (north of Sian) of
                        Chungking troop movements northwards in the direction of Lochwan in the
                        Shensi border region. According to a provincial official at Sian, these
                        movements are merely troop replacements. This official stated that no
                        military clashes had occurred, denied that Chungking [planned to] attack the
                        Communists and said that Chiang Kai-shek and Central Government are hoping
                        that the abandonment of the border government at Yenan will be brought about
                        by Chou <pb n="293" xml:id="pg_293" facs="0303"/>En-lai’s discussions with
                        Communist leaders there. (These views are similar to those expressed by
                        other Sian officials as reported in Embassy’s 1256, July 22, 5 p.m.)
                        Drumright feels as a result of his talks at Sian that the Central Government
                        is utilizing to fullest the opportunity presented by the dismay which the
                        dissolution of the Comintern has caused among the Communists to effect
                        peacefully this [<hi rend="italic">the</hi>] disbandment of Communist
                        government at Yenan.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to the Embassy’s telegram no.
                        1125, of July 8, 12 noon, in regard to Kuomintang-Communist differences,
                        there is enclosed a translation of a manifesto<note n="11" xml:id="d228fn11">Not printed.</note> issued by the Central Executive Committee of the
                        Chinese Communist Party on July 7, the sixth anniversary of the outbreak of
                        Sino-Japanese hostilities, which has been received by the Embassy from
                        Communist Party representatives at Chungking.</p>
                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>While the Central Government permits no mention of negotiations between the
                        Kuomintang and the Communist Party to be published, it is interesting to
                        note that it is stated in the manifesto that the Communists are “ready to
                        continue the negotiations with the National Party of China (Kuomintang) and
                        other parties and groups on the solution of existing problems and the
                        improvement of relations between parties and groups.” The need for national
                        unity and the improvement of governmental administration are urged. The
                        question is asked why a nation with a huge population such as China
                        possesses can be invaded by the Japanese with thirty divisions of troops. It
                        is admitted that the lack of industrial development is one reason, but the
                        chief reason is ascribed to the lack of democratic government in China. Hope
                        is expressed that the government will be able to effect necessary political
                        reforms in accordance with the Three People’s Principles in order to improve
                        the relations between classes, political parties and groups of people and in
                        order to arouse the spirit of the people. The government’s present financial
                        and economic policies are severely criticized and reforms therein are urged.
                        Economic reforms, it is said, should include the practice of a democratic
                        and centralized economic policy aimed at the development of production and
                        the adjustment of the economic interests of different classes, and all
                        groups should be mobilized for production.</p>
                    <p>Much of the manifesto is devoted to a description of the accomplishments of
                        the Communist Party and army, and an appeal is made to them to strengthen
                        their unity and continue their efforts to bring about the final defeat of
                        Japan. In conclusion, an appeal is made that the members of the Communist
                        Party unite with all anti-Japanese <pb n="295" xml:id="pg_295" facs="0305"/>parties, groups and people to support the National Government and
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the war against Japan.<note n="12" xml:id="d228fn12">
                     <p>Augustus S. Chase of the Division of Far Eastern
                                Affairs made these observations in a memorandum dated August 31:</p>
                            <p>“The following points not covered in the despatch are believed of
                                some interest:</p>
                            <p>“In addition to criticizing ‘those who oppose giving priority to the
                                defeat of Germany’, the manifesto reflects Soviet influence in
                                emphasizing the need for a second front in Europe. However, it shows
                                no lack of enthusiasm for the defeat of Japan.</p>
                            <p>“The following statements in the manifesto appear of some
                                significance, especially if, as some observers claim, Soviet Russia
                                continues to dictate the line of propaganda and action of Chinese
                                Communists: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                    <p>Hopes of Germany and Italy that ‘one of the allies might

                                    <p>Chinese Communists should ‘develop … anti-Japanese groups of

                    <p>1325. 1. In a telegram dated July 24 from Lanchow, Service states that, in
                        addition to movement of Central Government troops north from Sian (Embassy’s
                        1276, July 24, noon) other Chungking troops are reported to be moving
                        westward and troops and matériel such as artillery and tanks are said to be
                        concentrated in the region of Pingliang (eastern Kansu), a strategic point
                        on the western border of the Communist areas. Service reports that recruits
                        are being sent into Kansu from the south and that block houses are being
                        constructed in Lanchow area.</p>
                    <p>Service states that officials at Lanchow are suspicious and unwilling to
                        discuss the Communist situation. The military preparations are said there to
                        be against banditry in the province. Service observes that many signs point
                        toward local fears of a movement by the Communists west into Kansu and that
                        sources who have contact with the Communists expect such action within the
                        next year. He states that the Lanchow authorities have refused permission to
                        Lowdermilk and Phillips (Department’s technical experts) and their Chinese
                        assistants to visit Ninghsia and explains that their route of travel would
                        carry them through blockade zone near western border of Communist areas.</p>
                    <pb n="296" xml:id="pg_296" facs="0306"/>
                    <p>2. The circumstances described by Service would not seem to have materially
                        changed the situation which a well informed Chinese Communist at Chungking
                        states has eased considerably during the last week or 10 days. This
                        informant gives four possible reasons for the lessened tension: 1, the firm
                        stand taken by the Communist Party at a mass meeting at Yenan on July 9
                        which convinced the Kuomintang that the Communists were prepared to resist
                        any armed attack (two Kuomintang liaison officers were said by the informant
                        to have been present at the meeting); 2, the probable adverse foreign
                        reaction to the possibility of civil war, as evinced by the interest
                        displayed by foreign press correspondents at Chungking; 3, the reported
                        telegram sent to the Central Government by Dr. T. V. Soong (Embassy’s 1254,
                        July 22 [<hi rend="italic">21</hi>], 4 p.m.) to the effect that the U.S.
                        Government had expressed to him its serious concern over the possibility of
                        civil war in China; and, 4, the efforts of General Chou En-lai in the
                        discussions at Sian to bring about a better understanding of the Communist
                        position on the part of General Hu Tsung-nan.</p>

                    <p>According to this report, there have recently been rumors that the Chinese
                        Government was concentrating a large force of possibly seven divisions near
                        the Communist area, ostensibly to meet the Japanese threat from southern
                        Shansi. While it is believed that such movements have actually taken place,
                        their purpose is open to doubt. The British Ambassador in Chungking has been
                        informed by a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that, following the
                        dissolution of the Comintern, there had been a split in the ranks of the
                        Chinese Communists, the moderates favoring increased cooperation with, or
                        even incorporation in, the Nationalist Government and the extremists
                        insisting on remaining independent. The Generalissimo had apparently sent
                        proposals to Yenan, the Communist headquarters, <pb n="297" xml:id="pg_297" facs="0307"/>which amounted to the dissolution of the Communist
                        Government, incorporation of the Communist armies in the National Forces and
                        the recognition of Communism as an opposition political party.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested in Chungking by the British Military Attaché, according
                        to the Foreign Office, that the real reason for the troop movements may have
                        been to support the Central Government in their negotiations with the
                        Communists and fears have been expressed that an attack might be made on the
                        Communists. The Foreign Office has stated that it does not have any other
                        information to corroborate this interpretation and is merely passing it
                        along for what it may be worth. However, unconfirmed information from
                        another source in London is to the effect that two divisions of Communist
                        troops in the north have recently attacked the Central Government
                        forces.</p>

                        despatch, which through a careful and inclusive study of the use of wall
                        slogans for propaganda purposes, material hitherto unstudied, reveals to a
                        considerable extent the lines of political thinking of the Kuomintang, with
                        the latter’s insistence on the leadership principle and the primacy of the
                        Party, and the evident seriousness of the problems which face the Central
                        Government, such as provincialism, conscription, grain collection, opium

                        masses of people, vast numbers of whom cannot read, and feels that the
                        failure of the Party to devise new and original slogans (there has been no
                        change in the character of the slogans used since the beginning of
                        Sino-Japanese hostilities) to keep up the interest of the people and to meet

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report hereunder the
                        substance of an interview with Mr. Liang Shu-ming, well-known promoter of
                        experiments in Village Self-Government in Honan and Shantung Provinces, and
                        a prominent member of the Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties. Mr.
                        Liang agreed to talk freely with the undersigned only on condition that his
                        anonymity be strictly safeguarded. The views expressed in this report, it
                        must be understood, are those of Mr. Liang and not necessarily those of the
                        undersigned.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The political power of the Generalissimo
                            rests on the common and national will to expel the enemy from China.
                            However, in recent years he has tended more and more to mistake national
                            popularity as his own private possession, and to concentrate to a
                            greater and greater degree political power in his own hands. With this
                            increasing tendency to monopolize all political power, has arisen
                            ineptness in all forms of government and the present political structure
                            is becoming increasingly insecure; its eventual fall is inevitable. In
                            such an event, there should be a minimum of disorder, as the will of the
                            Chinese people for national resistance remains constant. The Federation
                            of Chinese Democratic Parties does not believe in the overthrow of the
                            Kuomintang, but rather in its reform from a party of national monopoly
                            to one of national cooperation. The present role of the Federation,
                            which is daily increasing in prestige and authority, is to develop a
                            liaison for all political groups in China, consolidation of the ideals
                            of the various parties and interests, and the preparation of a political
                            program to serve as a guide when the crisis arrives. This problem should
                            not prove to be too difficult of solution as the political struggle in
                            China is not for class domination, which tends to divide the people, but
                            for national independence, which serves to unite them.</p>

                            dated September 23 Troy L. Perkins of the Division of Far Eastern
                            Affairs observed: “Mr. Liang is perhaps too optimistic in regard to the
                            ability of the spirit of resistance alone to carry on should China’s
                            leader pass out of the picture, with the factional strife which would
                            probably ensue. The Federation of Chinese Democratic Parties is not an
                            antagonist of the Kuomintang; it hopes mainly to ameliorate the
                            shortcomings of that party and to effect eventually cooperation of all
                            parties.” (893.00/15104)</note>

                                life spanned the period of the courageous and successful struggle
                                which the Chinese people made to achieve freedom and enduring unity;
                                his zeal in this great labor has made an inestimable contribution to
                                the founding of the Chinese Republic, as have his wise counsel and
                                his eminent scholarship to the progress of the Republic through the
                                three decades of its life. He died while the nation he loved was
                                still engaged in a mortal conflict with Japan, whose armies had
                                invaded and laid waste much of his homeland; although he did not
                                live to see the final victory, he yet died in the full assurance
                                that victory was certain, and that through it the Chinese people
                                would march on to a happy and prosperous future.</p>
                            <p>Please convey to President Lin Sen’s family my deep personal sympathy
                                in their sorrow and bereavement. Franklin D. Roosevelt.”</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy
                        of a report<note n="18" xml:id="d235fn18">Not printed.</note> on conditions
                        in Yeungkong, a district city on the southeastern coast of Kwangtung
                        Province, submitted under date of July 19, 1943, by the Consul at
                        Kweilin.</p>
                    <p>It will be noted from the report that Yeungkong is suffering from famine,
                        despite the fact that it is a rich agricultural area and normally has a
                        surplus of rice. This situation is said to be due mainly to the fact that
                        rice is hoarded by moneyed interests and exported to occupied areas. Basic
                        difficulties appear to be “landlordism” and official corruption, with
                        wealthy absentee landlords adding to their wealth, by reason of the high
                        prices, while tenants suffer from hunger and laborers and fishermen are
                        destitute. The district magistrate, dominated by the landlords, is said to
                        be rapidly becoming wealthy by various forms of dishonesty, such as
                        smuggling and padding the army payroll.</p>
                    <p>Practically all the trade of the district is reported to be with occupied
                        areas, the district being cut off from interior China by lack of <pb n="301" xml:id="pg_301" facs="0311"/>communications. Cloth, medicines, paper,
                        dyes, etc. are brought into the district from occupied China in exchange for
                        rice and tung oil. Only salt is shipped to Free China. From a
                        Japanese-occupied island about ten miles off the coast, there are apparently
                        substantial shipments of wolfram.</p>
                    <p>According to a report from the Consul at Kweilin, dated July 6, 1943,
                        conditions are somewhat similar in the district of Kityang, near Swatow, in
                        northeastern Kwangtung. Kityang is also the center of a rich agricultural
                        area, but people are starving. This is due partly to inadequate food
                        supplies, a result of a lack of fertilizer, subnormal rainfall and a heavy
                        influx of refugees from occupied areas around Swatow, where conditions are
                        said to be even worse. Mainly, however, it appears to be the old story of
                        corrupt officials and greedy landlords and merchants who hoard grain or
                        export it to occupied China. There is a steady and quite open traffic across
                        the Kityang river, which is the boundary between occupied and Free China,
                        the Chinese officials excusing it by saying that if they prohibited the
                        shipment of foodstuffs to occupied territory, the enemy might raid Kityang
                        and take the entire supply.<note n="19" xml:id="d235fn19">In a memorandum
                            dated September 22 Troy L. Perkins of the Division of Far Eastern
                            Affairs observed: “The report comes first-hand from an American source
                            and the conditions described provide evidence for the contention of the
                            Chinese ‘Communists’ that popular support of the war will sag where
                            corruption and economic oppression are allowed to flourish.”</note>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Communists attribute the reported
                            lessening of the tension between Kuomintang and Communist forces in
                            Shensi partly to the belief of the Central Government that the
                            Communists are prepared to resist any armed attack on the Border Region.
                            A circular telegram sent to Central Government leaders on July 9 by a
                            Communist mass meeting at Yenan reiterated Communist desire for unity,
                            resistance to Japan, opposition to civil war and determination to defend
                            the Border Region. Kuomintang claims that the dissolution of the
                            Comintern has severely shaken the unity of the Communist Party are
                            denied by the Communists who assert that the Chinese Communist Party is
                            sufficiently mature to stand alone and that the Comintern has long since
                            ceased to give any but moral support to the Party. There seems to be no
                            likelihood that the differences between the two parties can be settled
                            amicably, and it is believed that neither side is prepared to make the
                            concessions necessary for reaching a settlement of their
                            differences.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>There has reportedly been a lessening of the tension between the Central
                        Government and the Communist forces in the Shensi border areas during the
                        past ten days. One of the four reasons to which Miss Kung ascribes this
                        eased tension, as reported in the Embassy’s telegram under reference, is the
                        strong stand taken by the Communist Party at a mass meeting at Yenan on July
                        9 which convinced the Kuomintang leaders that the Communists were prepared
                        to resist any armed attack on the Border Region. She states that two
                        Kuomintang officials sent to Yenan by the Central Government for liaison
                        work were present at that meeting.</p>
                    <p>A circular telegram was addressed by this mass meeting to President Lin Sen,
                        General Chiang Kai-shek, the heads of the various Ministries and Yuans, the
                        army officers fighting against the Japanese, the various parties opposing
                        Japan and all compatriots, in which telegram the instigators of the present
                        trouble are said to be Japanese fifth columnists within the Chinese army who
                        are endeavoring to foment civil war. The charge was made that the war
                        against Communism is being given priority over the war against Japan. The
                        telegram then went on to make certain demands and requests of General Chiang
                        and to General Hu Tsung-nan<note n="22" xml:id="d236fn22">Commanding Chinese
                            troops on borders of Communist areas in Shensi.</note> for the return of
                        the Central Government troops to their original positions, the maintenance
                        of unity and the avoidance of civil war. The Communists demanded the arrest
                        and public trial of Wu Kai-hsien, calling him a secret envoy of the
                        Japanese. (This former Kuomintang leader at Shanghai, who arrived <pb n="303" xml:id="pg_303" facs="0313"/>at Chungking several months ago,
                        was met at the airport by leading Kuomintang officials, including Dr. Chu
                        Chia-hua, the Minister of Organization of the Kuomintang. He reportedly
                        brought with him peace terms from the Japanese. Unconfirmed reports have
                        reached the Embassy that Wu returned to Nanking in late June bearing with
                        him the reply of the Chungking Government. The nature of the alleged terms
                        and reply are not known to the Embassy.) In the telegram demands were also
                        presented for the punishment of the generals of the Central Government
                        armies who have surrendered to the puppet regime, and all parties and
                        patriots were requested to follow the mottoes of the Communist Party: (1)
                        uphold the war of resistance and oppose civil war; (2) maintain unity; (3)
                        oppose the transfer of Central Government troops to the Border Region and
                        send these troops against the Japanese; (4) punish the organizations which
                        are inciting civil war; (5) support the Communist Party and defend the
                        Border Region; (6) put into practice the San Min Chu I; (7) mobilize the
                        people to protect the entire country, including the Border Region and north
                        China; and (8) overthrow Japanese imperialism and the fifth column.</p>
                    <p>The Kuomintang authorities, whose statements are paralleled by broadcasts
                        emanating from Japanese radio stations in the occupied areas, claim that
                        there is widespread dissension among the Communists (Embassy’s telegram No.
                        1240, July 21, 9 a.m. and No. 1256, July 22, 5 p.m.) who are said to have
                        been split into three groups as a result of the dissolution of the
                        Comintern. One group, led by Mao Tze-tung, is said to favor the continuation
                        of the Party’s present policy; the second group, led by Wang Ming (the last
                        Chinese representative on the Executive Committee of the Comintern who
                        returned to China from Moscow at the end of 1937), is said to support a
                        revolutionary policy; the third group, under the leadership of General Chou
                        En-lai, is described by the Kuomintang as desirous of coming to terms with
                        the Central Government by surrender of the Communist government and
                        army.</p>
                    <p>Communist representatives at Chungking deny the charges of disunity in the
                        Communist Party and state that, while the dissolution of the Comintern came
                        as a surprise to the rank and file of the Party, it was not unexpected by
                        the leaders. The Communists maintain that the Comintern has provided only
                        moral support for several years and that all material assistance from Soviet
                        Russia in the form of military supplies has for some years gone only to the
                        Central Government. The Communists assert that the Kuomintang is utilizing
                        the dissolution of the Comintern in order to create the impression that
                        there is dissension in the Communist Party. The Communist representatives
                        deny the accuracy of these stories and firmly assert that no such dissension
                        exists. They point to the above-described circular <pb n="304" xml:id="pg_304" facs="0314"/>telegram as evidence of the unity of the
                        Chinese Communist Party.</p>
                    <p>In the report said to have been made by Mr. Mao Tze-tung at Yenan in regard
                        to the dissolution of the Comintern (this report was not published in the
                        local Communist newspaper), Mr. Mao asserts that the Comintern has extended
                        considerable assistance to the three great revolutionary movements in China:
                        the northern expedition, the land revolution and the anti-Japanese war. He
                        refers to the assistance given by the Comintern to Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the
                        Kuomintang in 1924 and calls attention to General Chiang Kai-shek’s visit to
                        Moscow at that time and the presence of Kuomintang representatives at
                        meetings of the Comintern.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Mao gives three reasons for the dissolution of the Comintern: (1) the
                        complicated and rapidly changing conditions in different countries require a
                        leadership which can be obtained through a careful study of local
                        conditions. Such a study cannot be conducted by an international
                        organization far removed from the scene of activity in the various
                        countries. (2) A central organization such as the Comintern is inappropriate
                        for the varying conditions found in countries both in the Fascist and
                        anti-Fascist camps, as in both groups there are socialist, capitalist,
                        colonial and semi-colonial entities. (3) the Communist Parties in the
                        various countries have reached maturity. The ability of the Chinese
                        Communist Party to stand alone is shown by the circumstance that since 1935
                        the Comintern has not interfered with internal questions of the Party. Mr.
                        Mao continues that the dissolution of the Comintern is thus not for the
                        purpose of weakening the Communist parties of the various countries but
                        rather for the purpose of strengthening the parties in order to make them
                        more nationalistic and more in conformity with the needs of the antifascist
                        war. He adds that the disciplinary movement of the Communist Party has in
                        recent years opposed subjectivism, sectarianism and party formalism in order
                        to make the Party a national party in conformity with the needs of the war
                        and of national reconstruction. Mr. Mao concludes with an appeal for unity,
                        stating that there are two prerequisites: unity within the party and unity
                        between the party and the people.</p>
                    <p>It is difficult to know where the truth lies between the charges made by the
                        Kuomintang that the Communist Party has been severely shaken by the
                        dissolution of the Comintern and the assertions of the Communists that their
                        Party is firmly united both against the Japanese and against any attack from
                        the Central Government. It seems probable that the dissolution of the
                        Comintern has produced a psychological reaction among the Communists who may
                        now feel that the Kuomintang believes itself to be in a position where it
                        can move against the Communists without fear of too adverse a reaction from
                            <pb n="305" xml:id="pg_305" facs="0315"/>Soviet Russia. The final appeal
                        of Mr. Mao Tze-tung in his above-described report points to the necessity of
                        unity and, by implication, to some fear that complete unity does not exist.
                        The Kuomintang may have assumed that Communist unity was so severely
                        shattered that it could successfully attack the Border Region or that its
                        exertion of pressure on the Communists could bring about Communist
                        acceptance of terms favorable to the Central Government.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has so far received no indications that the Communists are
                        willing to accede to Kuomintang demands that the Communist Border Government
                        and army be surrendered to the Central Government. There are indeed
                        indications to the contrary, as shown by reports (Embassy’s telegram No.
                        1325, July 28, 6 p.m.) that there exist fears that the Communists may
                        attempt to move west into Kansu Province within the next year. The struggle
                        between the two parties thus seems likely to continue, and the situation
                        shows no signs of being ameliorated through concessions on the part of
                        either faction.</p>
                    <p>Unless the Chungking authorities feel that the present moment offers the most
                        favorable opportunity for liquidation of the Communists or unless the
                        Central Government control over the areas now under its authority should
                        become so weakened through local dissension as to make any such areas
                        susceptible to Communist propaganda or easy prey to Communist attack, it
                        seems probable that the final settlement of the Kuomintang-Communist problem
                        will be postponed until the end of the war.</p>
                    <p>A thorough settlement would on the one hand include the establishment by the
                        Chungking leaders of representative government with participation therein by
                        the Communist Party and on the other hand would include surrender by the
                        Communists of their Border Government and army. Given the present temper of
                        the Kuomintang leaders and the determination of the Communists not to make
                        any important compromise which would deprive them of guarantees of their
                        support (that is, their Border Government and army), prospects of such a
                        settlement seem so remote as to be beyond the realm of possibility. Most
                        observers are accordingly of the opinion that open and bitter hostilities
                        are inevitable in the long run.<note n="23" xml:id="d236fn23">

                                not practice Communism at present and although they state that the
                                dissolution of the Comintern has ended their dependence upon Moscow,

                    <p>1036. Your 1254, July 21, 4 p.m. During the course of a conversation on July
                        30 with the Chinese Ambassador, I mentioned a report that had reached us to
                        the effect that T. V. Soong had sent word to Chungking that an American
                        official had spoken in a rather officious manner about China’s policies as
                        they relate to the Communist situation there. I remarked that I could not
                        understand this and I said that, although some American officials, including
                        myself, have wanted at all times to be kept informed concerning China’s
                        internal situation involving political and economic aspects, et cetera,
                        primarily in order to be currently informed as to China’s capacity for
                        resistance in the war between her and Japan, any inquiries on those points,
                        of course, have not the remotest resemblance to what Dr. Soong is said to
                        have reported to Chungking. Ambassador Wei said that he had not heard of the
                        report, that it was likewise incomprehensible to him.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit a memorandum of
                        comments made to me by Mr. M. Konstantinoff, the Soviet Embassy
                        representative in Lanchow, regarding the war and internal problems in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>In brief summary: Mr. Konstantinoff is concerned over the
                        Kuomintang-Communist situation but denies the possibility of Russian
                        intervention or assistance to the Communists. He also feels that the present
                        Chinese Government is making a mistake in its handling of the minorities
                        question in the Northwest and border regions. He does not expect Russian
                        participation in the war against Japan.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Konstantinoff served in the Consulate General at Shanghai from about 1937
                        to 1940, returned to the Foreign Office for a period of duty, and then came
                        to Lanchow in August, 1942. He has been very friendly to me, and to Captain
                            Tolstoy,<note n="25" xml:id="d238fn25">Ilia Tolstoy, of the Office of

                        <p>Mr. Konstantinoff’s comments regarding the suspicion with which he is
                            treated by the local authorities has been mentioned in other reports
                            (see despatch no. 22, August 3, 1943<note n="26" xml:id="d238fn26">Not
                                found in Department files, but see despatch No. 1480, August 17,

                            315</ref>.</note>). He considers Americans relatively free from this
                            attitude and envies what he speaks of as our freedom to travel and to
                            make personal contacts with Chinese.</p>
                        <p>He is very much interested in the Mohammedan question in the Northwest
                            and in the Chinese treatment of the Tibetans and Mongols. The Mohammedan
                            question, he feels, is more important than Chinese realize and they will
                            continue to be opposed by the Mohammedans until Mohammedan interests are
                            recognized and given a more important share in Party and local
                            government matters. Mohammedan unrest, along with agrarian and landlord
                            resistance to taxation and conscription is, he believes, an important
                            factor in the recent disturbances in Kansu.</p>
                        <p>The Tibetans and Mongols, he believes, cannot be won to China unless
                            China abandons its attitude toward “subject” peoples, gives up its
                            present policy of “sinification”, and gives up its efforts to govern
                            them by direct control or through support of their own feudalistic
                            leaders. Positively he thinks that the Chinese must permit these peoples
                            to have their own free cultural development, grant them full powers of
                            local government (at the same time assisting their progress toward
                            democracy by weakening the power of the church and feudal nobility), and
                            assist their economic development by technical help in such matters as
                            control of animal disease. Mr. Konstantinoff has recently been reading
                            Owen Lattimore’s <hi rend="italic">Inner Asian Frontiers of China</hi>.
                            He expresses great interest in it and general agreement with its
                            conclusions.</p>
                        <p>The model for his thinking on the minorities question is obviously the
                            Russian treatment of its own Central Asian minorities and the revolution
                            that has been brought about in Outer Mongolia. He denies Russian control
                            of Outer Mongolia but admits Russian assistance. The conditions of the
                            people as a whole have been so improved that the country will fight
                            against either Japan or China if the need arises.</p>
                        <p>Similarly in regard to Sinkiang, Mr. Konstantinoff fears that Chinese <pb n="308" xml:id="pg_308" facs="0318"/>policies, unless radically
                            changed, will alienate rather than win the people. In any event, he
                            believes, Sinkiang cannot avoid having closer economic ties with Russia
                            than with China.</p>
                        <p>The current emphasis on the development of the Northwest has primarily
                            political significance. Development work cannot be carried out until
                            after the war and even then only in the face of physical difficulties
                            which the Chinese will not for some time, because of technical
                            deficiencies, be able to surmount.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Konstantinoff is much concerned over the present tension between the
                            Kuomintang and the Chinese Communists. At the same time he appears to be
                            without channels of information on actual developments. He has avoided
                            contact with the Communist representatives in Lanchow and is always
                            interested in attempting to learn any news that I may have. He feels
                            strongly that the Kuomintang will be making a “very serious mistake” if
                            it attempts to liquidate the Communists by force, suggesting that the
                            Communists may utilize forces of discontent in the country and prove too
                            strong for the Kuomintang. He is pessimistic about the future of
                            relations between the two parties and regards eventual trouble as
                            probably inevitable.</p>
                        <p>He laughs at Chinese rumors and stories of Soviet planes flying back and
                            forth to the Communist area, denies that they have received any material
                            assistance from Russia “for many years”, and goes on to say that Russia
                            is now too concerned with her own life-and-death struggle to intervene
                            in China or to give help to the Chinese Communists. (His remarks may be
                            interpreted as implying, however, that if Russia were not so concerned
                            with the war against Germany, she might be interested in helping the
                            Communists.)</p>
                        <p>In discussing the Communists he takes the line that they are not
                            Communistic in the Russian sense. But he believes that China is not
                            ready for full Communism and that the Chinese program is therefore more
                            appropriate for the conditions in China. He believes the Communists have
                            made great progress in honest government, in eliminating graft and
                            corruption, in economic control, in political indoctrination of the
                            people so that they have an interest in the war, and in representative
                            government.</p>
                        <p>He criticizes the reactionary tendencies of the Kuomintang and their
                            treatment of the people.</p>
                        <p>Discussing the possibility of Russian participation in the war against
                            Japan, Mr. Konstantinoff thinks that this is unlikely. Russia’s own
                            problems in defeating Germany and in rehabilitating her destroyed areas
                            will consume her entire resources for some time. She will be friendly
                            toward the Allies in their war against Japan but her assistance will
                            probably not go as far as permitting American use of Russian
                            airbases.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                        telegram No. 1197, July 16, 10 [<hi rend="italic">8</hi>] a.m.<note n="27" xml:id="d240fn27">Not printed.</note> in regard to the recent change in
                        status of certain Chinese consular offices in the Soviet Union and to
                        transmit herewith a copy of a despatch (no. 17 of July 3, 1943) from the
                        Consulate at Tihwa<note n="27" xml:id="d240fn1">Not printed.</note> on the
                        general subject of Sinkiang–U. S. S. R. relations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clubb first sets forth in somewhat more detail the information contained
                        in the Embassy’s reference telegram.</p>
                    <p>He then gives such information as he has been able to obtain in regard to
                        political prisoners in Sinkiang, a subject which he apparently confused with
                        the Department’s inquiry (telegram no. 823, June 29, 5 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] p.m. to the Embassy) in regard to imprisonment of Chinese
                        nationals in Siberia. Mr. Clubb quotes the estimate of a reliable but not
                        necessarily exactly informed source to the effect that during the past three
                        years about 1,000 persons have been imprisoned in Tihwa for political
                        reasons, including some 300 since August 1942 (the date of the visit to
                        Sinkiang of Mme. Chiang Kai-shek and General Chu Shao-liang). A number of
                        Chinese returned students from Russia and other intellectuals are reportedly
                        included in this latter group. Mr. Clubb makes a “conservative rough
                        estimate” that some 20 Russians and perhaps 40 Chinese (assumably political
                        prisoners) have been released from Tihwa prisons since last August.</p>
                    <p>In the latter part of his despatch Mr. Clubb discusses at some length
                        Soviet-Sinkiang relations and the political situation in Sinkiang. His
                        observations may be summarized as follows:</p>
                    <pb n="310" xml:id="pg_310" facs="0320"/>
                    <p>It appears probable that the political influence until recently exercised in
                        Sinkiang by the Soviet Union has been somewhat over-estimated due to
                        exaggerated political significance being attached to the stationing of
                        Russian troops at Hami, the presence of Soviet advisors and technicians in
                        the Sinkiang government, the trade relations between Sinkiang and the U. S.
                        S. R., and political imprisonments which seemed to be the result of Soviet
                        influence. The present deterioration in Soviet-Sinkiang relations began in
                        the summer of 1942 when Governor Sheng Shih-tsai, apparently underestimating
                        Russian strength vis-à-vis Germany, and overestimating the potentialities of
                        the Chinese Central Government, found it opportune to re-orient his
                        relationships under circumstances unlikely to increase sympathy between the
                        Soviet Union and either Sinkiang Province or the Central Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clubb cites instances of political unrest in Sinkiang (in spite of the
                        very strict police control in the province) and points out that the
                        political situation may be expected to worsen with the anticipated
                        deterioration in the provincial economy, a situation which does not point to
                        any increase in the stability of Governor Sheng’s regime or in Central
                        Government influence in Sinkiang. Although he hints that the Soviet Union
                        would not be above taking advantage of the situation, Mr. Clubb thinks it
                        highly improbable that the Russians would, under present circumstances,
                        enter Sinkiang in force in order to set up a regime sympathetic to them.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>The Embassy’s views in regard to the significance of the book and its
                        anti-liberal and somewhat anti-foreign tone are believed to be well taken.
                        It is believed, however, that foreigners, in their initial reaction to the
                        book, have perhaps shown a tendency to view it solely in the perspective of
                        the war and United Nations objectives and hence to overemphasize undesirable
                        features which from a long-range viewpoint take on a more natural if not
                        less disturbing character. In fairness the following may be pointed out:</p>
                    <p>Criticism of foreign countries, with the exception of Japan, is largely
                        confined to the pre-war past—though it is true that an unfortunately
                        distorted and biased picture of China’s treatment by foreign nations is
                        drawn with the obvious purpose<note n="28" xml:id="d241fn28">Notation by the
                            Adviser on Political Relations (Hornbeck): “Many Chinese believe it. S.

                        failures were the result of the “unequal treaties”. With respect to the
                        present and future, the sentiment toward foreign countries other than Japan
                        and its Axis partners is friendly rather than hostile except for an
                        assertion in Chapter VIII that European political philosophy makes mankind
                        the slaves of the techniques of war and industrial production in contrast to
                        China’s philosophy which regards them as servants of mankind. Even with
                        regard to the past, criticism of the United States is limited to including
                        us among the nations which imposed “unequal treaties”: There is no specific

                        our aid to China. The past encroachments of Britain and Russia are severely
                        and specifically censured, but in both the past and present Japan is the
                        principal target and the epithet “Japanese brigands” appears frequently.
                        China’s new “equal treaties” with the United States and Britain are extolled
                        at length and it is stated that their conclusion “is not only the most
                        important page in the history of the rebirth of our Chinese people, but the
                        friendly nations of America and England have erected a shining beacon to the
                        equality and freedom of the world and humanity.” There are several cordial
                        references to China’s association with the United Nations and their common
                        objectives and at least brief passages which refute the charge that Nazism
                        and Fascism are not attacked. While it is made clear that Outer Mongolia,
                        Kowloon and Hong Kong should be returned to Chinese control, the approach
                        here is friendly in tone. Sympathy for the aspirations of Asiatic peoples is
                        expressed but without any threat or specific demands. <pb n="312" xml:id="pg_312" facs="0322"/>Even the worst passages of the book are
                        more moderate than propaganda issued by the Kuomintang at earlier stages of
                        its career.</p>
                    <p>As the Embassy indicates, the book’s anti-liberal tone appears of more
                        serious consequence than its anti-foreign aspects. Even here, however, the
                        book is not a new iteration of policy but only an authoritative confirmation
                        of already manifested reactionary Kuomintang views. Moreover, the basis for
                        objection lies less in the actual statements made than in the inferences to
                        be drawn from a background knowledge of the Kuomintang’s past conduct. Thus,
                        one could hardly describe as reactionary the statements that all political
                        views will be tolerated save those which seek to overthrow Kuomintang
                        control by force, that local political and social reforms are being
                        undertaken and have only failed of completion as a result of disturbed
                        conditions, that the Kuomintang program calls for “equalization of land
                        rights and limitation of capital”, and that individual freedom must be
                        tempered with respect for the law. It is only when one realizes the past
                        consistent failure of the Chungking Government to carry out its pledges to
                        the people, the obstinate determination of reactionary Kuomintang elements
                        to preserve their power and opportunities for profit, and the uncompromising
                        attitude toward the Chinese Communists that the unfortunate significance of
                        the book becomes evident. Even the position taken toward Western democracy
                        is offset by well-sounding statements with which it is difficult to take
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, the worst that may be said of the book is that it
                        authoritatively reaffirms undesirable policies already expressed and that a
                        particularly unfortunate time has been chosen for its publication. The best
                        that can be said of it is that it is obviously intended to build up a spirit
                        of patriotism, unity, self-respect and self-reliance among the Chinese
                        people and that the methods used to achieve this purpose are probably no
                        worse than those employed in nationalistic propaganda of most other
                        countries.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that the Consul at
                        Tihwa, in a telegram dated August 1, states that he has been confidentially
                        informed by the local Special Delegate for Foreign Affairs that the Soviet
                        Russians are removing all equipment but water and light units from <pb n="313" xml:id="pg_313" facs="0323"/>the Toutungho airplane assembly
                        plant; that the U.S.S.R. Government is now offering to sell the remaining
                        installations to the Chinese Government at a reported price of $4,000,000
                        (assumably U.S. currency); and that the chief of the Chinese air force,
                        General Chou Chih-jou, who recently inspected the plant, will probably
                        recommend to the Generalissimo that it either be re-equipped for plane
                        assembly or used as an advanced air training school, and that American
                        lend-lease aid be requested to enable purchase of the present plant and
                        needed additional equipment. Mr. Clubb states that he is reporting more
                        fully on the matter by mail.</p>
                    <p>In a mail despatch (no. 20, July 28, 1943<note n="30" xml:id="d242fn30">Not
                            printed.</note>) Mr. Clubb gives the following information in regard to
                        the Toutungho plant.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>“The T’ou T’ung Ho airplane assembly plant, which has operated under the
                            name “Agricultural Implements Factory”, is located 42 kilometers from
                            Tihwa, at the foot of a mountain range at the approximate point at which
                            a small river (presumably of the same name) debouches onto the plain, on
                            a road which leaves the main highway at a point 23 kilometers northwest
                            of town in a line directly southwest. It is reported that Russian
                            evacuation of that place is nearly completed, the only remaining
                            material to be removed consisting of lumber, furniture, et cetera.
                            Information obtained in Kuldja indicated that about 800 Soviet Russian
                            citizens (including families) had been in residence at that place and
                            were now removing to the Soviet Union. The location is not readily
                            observable from the highway, but from one point it was seen to include a
                            good number of buildings and something which seemed to be a water
                            tower.</p>
                        <p>It is not as yet clear just why, from both the Chinese and Russian points
                            of view, the project in question was originally undertaken.”</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>No information is available as to the exact extent of the development at
                        Toutungho but it is the Embassy’s understanding that no planes have actually
                        been assembled there.</p>
                    <p>From information at present available the geographic location of the plant
                        and the transportation difficulties in Sinkiang would seem to render its use
                        either as a plane assembly plant or an air training school economically
                        impractical. If it later appears that the Chinese desire to push the project
                        and that their motives are principally political, the Embassy suggests that
                        the Department might wish to give consideration to the implications of
                        American aid for the project before such aid is extended.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy will, of course, keep the Department fully informed of any
                        further developments.</p>

                        during war, at least very shortly after peace comes, by political means. He

                    <p>1438. Embassy’s 1183, July 14, noon. The Military Attaché Colonel DePass, who
                        has recently returned, yesterday received a visit from the Soviet Military
                        Attaché who indicated that the Soviet Government was much concerned over the
                        Kuomintang-Communist situation and who made persistent efforts to elicit
                        information as to the probable attitude of the American Government,
                        especially in regard to the continued furnishing of aid to China, in case
                        actual hostilities between the Kuomintang and the Communist forces should
                        break out. (I am satisfied that DePass handled the conversation
                        properly.)</p>
                    <p>This continued more or less open Soviet interest in the Kuomintang-Communist
                        situation is of perhaps more than superficial significance. It seems to
                        offer for one thing an illuminating sidelight on present Sino-Soviet
                        relations and might be interpreted as giving some support to fears, which
                        are deeply ingrained in reactionary Kuomintang Government circles, of
                        Russia’s good faith as a partial Ally and of Russia’s future intentions. For
                        example, the line of argument of Chinese officials who have advocated the
                        resolving of the Communist <pb n="315" xml:id="pg_315" facs="0325"/>problem
                        by force has been that otherwise, if and when Russia should enter the war
                        against Japan, Russian forces would sweep down through Manchuria and Korea
                        and their Chinese Communist colleagues would take over North China. Now with
                        the Communist question added to other important outstanding Sino-Russian
                        problems the prospects of friendly and sincere cooperation between Russia
                        and China either during or after the war would seem to be lessening rather
                        than increasing.</p>

                        No. 1310 of June 30, 1943 on the subject of conditions in Kansu
                        Province.</p>
                    <p>There is now enclosed a copy of a despatch No. 9, July 18, 1943, with
                            enclosure,<note n="34" xml:id="d248fn34">Neither printed.</note> from
                        the Second Secretary at Lanchow, in regard to political unrest in Kansu,
                        which may be summarized as follows:</p>
                    <p>An agrarian uprising which occurred in parts of Kansu last spring, in which
                        perhaps 50,000 or more armed peasants participated, has now subsided
                        assumably because of their present [pre]occupation with the cultivation and
                        harvesting of crops. Among the causes of the unrest were (1) dislike for the
                        provincial regime (the chairman is considered unduly harsh and his
                        subordinates, principally from other provinces, are considered “foreign”);
                        (2) resentment of conscription <pb n="317" xml:id="pg_317" facs="0327"/>and
                        heavy grain collections; (3) apparent attempts by the Provincial Government
                        to suppress the opium trade, which is largely in the hands of secret
                        societies which are linked to the powerful landlord-gentry class; and (4)
                        presence within the province of armed, disbanded former soldiers.</p>
                    <p>According to Mr. Service, it appears likely that, with the completion of
                        agricultural activities in the Autumn and recommencement of collection of
                        taxes in kind, disturbances will recur. To meet this situation and to guard
                        against a possible attempt by the Communists to capitalize on the situation
                        by moving into Central Kansu, the troops in the province have been
                        reinforced and defense works are being constructed.</p>

                    <p rend="center">I</p>
                    <p>The basic aims in the Far East of the Soviet Union do not differ in
                        fundamental character from its aims in Europe, in the Near East, or in other
                        areas adjacent or near to the U.S.S.R. The perhaps primary motivating factor
                        in Soviet policy is a natural desire to promote national security. The
                        economic and political—including security—aspects of Soviet aims in the Far
                        East are closely interwoven.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government has as one of its paramount political objectives the
                        creation ideologically sympathetic governments in nearby areas. As
                        outstanding examples we have the Soviet Union’s infiltration into Outer
                        Mongolia (where a Soviet Government has been created) and its influence in
                        Sinkiang and among the so-called Chinese Communists in northwest China. It
                        is believed that Korean guerrillas operating in Manchuria have close Soviet
                        connections. By virtue of Soviet influence in Outer Mongolia, the Mongols in
                        Inner Mongolia would probably be susceptible to Soviet propaganda and
                        infiltration. Reference to the German, Polish, Yugoslavian and other “free”
                        movements sponsored by the Soviet Government should give clear indication of
                        the course which that Government is likely to attempt to follow vis-à-vis
                        China, Korea, Japan and possibly other areas in the Far East, such as Burma,
                        Thailand and <pb n="318" xml:id="pg_318" facs="0328"/>the Philippines if and
                        when the Soviet Government feels the time is propitious. The Soviet
                        Government has a deep organic suspicion of any and all non-Soviet
                        governments. This suspicion gives rise to determined efforts to bring
                        neighboring governments and peoples into Soviet Russia’s orbit and actually,
                        if not openly, to exercise control over them. At the same time and for
                        similar reasons, the Soviet Union seeks to influence and, if possible, to
                        gain control of social and economic movements which might be termed
                        revolutionary in the orthodox sense of that term. Movements of this
                        character may be expected to increase in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The Soviet Government still has a strong desire for warm water ports. It is
                        to be expected, therefore, that one of its basic objectives in the Far East
                        is to obtain access to the Pacific through a port or ports in north China or
                        in Korea. As a corollary to this objective, we may also expect Soviet Russia
                        to desire transit privileges via the railways across Manchuria to a warm
                        water port or ports and to Vladivostok. It is probable that Soviet Russia
                        would not feel it necessary to annex a warm water port in north China or in
                        Korea provided such port or ports were under a government of which the
                        Russian Government approved and upon which it felt it could rely—in other
                        words, a government more or less similar to that which now exists in Outer
                        Mongolia.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II</p>
                    <p>So long as the military situation in Europe is such as to require the
                        concentration of practically all of the offensive strength of the U.S.S.R.
                        against Germany, it is probable that the implementation of Soviet policies
                        in the Far East will be confined for the most part to political maneuvering
                        and intrigue, to dissemination of propaganda and to proselyting of Communist
                        disciples. In the meantime the Soviet Government will take full advantage of
                        every possible opportunity to prepare for more positive action in the
                        future. It is difficult to estimate what the situation in Soviet Russia will
                        be after the termination of Russo-German hostilities, and it is
                        correspondingly difficult to estimate the amount of strength which Soviet
                        Russia will then be able to turn toward the Far East. It is reasonable to
                        expect, however, that Soviet Russia will at some time in the future depart
                        from its present policy of not offering material assistance to the Chinese
                        Communists and of not openly opposing the Japanese. An article recently
                        published in a semi-official Soviet journal criticizing the Kuomintang
                        Government of China affords illuminating evidence that the U.S.S.R. is
                        acutely conscious of developments in the Far East. It is most likely that
                        while the Soviet Union remains engaged in Europe on the present scale it
                        will continue to follow a policy of expedient stability in its relations
                        with Japan and of maintaining at least openly <pb n="319" xml:id="pg_319" facs="0329"/>a neutral attitude between the Chinese Communists and the
                        Kuomintang.</p>
                    <p>One effect of peace in Europe will be to strengthen Soviet Russia’s hand in
                        the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The degree to which Soviet influence in the Far East will be increased will
                        depend upon a number of factors which must for the present at least remain
                        imponderables. It is to be noted, however, that conditions in the Far East
                        and the policies and programs pursued by China, by Japan and by Western
                        countries will have an important effect upon the development of the position
                        of Soviet Russia in the Far East. In other words, in addition to the
                        positive side of Russian aims, policies and programs, account must also be
                        taken of probable situations and conditions which might further Soviet aims
                        without there being put forth any considerable positive effort on the part
                        of the U.S.S.R. It may be assumed that areas in the Far East where there
                        exist social unrest and political instability, conducive to the type of
                        so-called revolutionary movements mentioned earlier in this memorandum, will
                        furnish fertile fields for the extension of Soviet influence. Such a
                        development need not, and probably will not, have as its aim territorial
                        aggrandizement or even well-defined political objectives on the part of the
                        Soviet Union. It may quite understandably be more in the nature of an
                        attraction on the part of the peoples of those areas to Soviet Russia,
                        because of dissatisfaction with governmental policies and conditions in
                        those areas, than in the nature of a positive move on the part of the Soviet
                        Government. It is well to bear in mind, therefore, that post-war conditions
                        in China and other Far Eastern areas—such as failures to give serious
                        attention to the needs of the people—may be more responsible for political
                        developments in the Far East in which Soviet Russia would be concerned than
                        any policy or initiative taken by the Soviet Government. There will be a
                        natural tendency, however, on the part of the authorities in the area
                        concerned, such as in China, to place the blame for their own failures at
                        the doorstep of Moscow as the instigator of social unrest.</p>
                    <p>In any post-war settlement which is worked out in the Far East it is to be
                        expected that Soviet Russia will seek to influence that settlement in a way
                        which would facilitate the realization of basic Soviet desiderata set forth
                        in the first section of this memorandum. It is believed that this will be
                        true whether Soviet Russia actively enters the war against Japan or not. The
                        Soviet Union will probably seek to gain control of or to create Sovietized
                        governments among the peoples of Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea and
                        possibly other areas in the Western Pacific; in the matter of influence,
                        Soviet desires would include substantial influence in and over Japan.</p>
                    <pb n="320" xml:id="pg_320" facs="0330"/>
                    <p>Should the Soviet Union, as is likely, enter the war against Japan in its
                        later stages and before Japan’s capitulation, she would probably endeavor to
                        send troops into Manchuria, southern Saghalin and Korea. Were she to achieve
                        this, she would probably make demands for some territorial and/or
                        administrative advantages in those areas for Soviet account; but this is
                        problematical. The Soviet Union would probably demand an important voice at
                        any conference in relation to the settlement of Far Eastern affairs. In any
                        event it is reasonable to expect Soviet Russia to wish to move into areas,
                        if any, in north China and possibly Korea where a political vacuum might
                        have been created by the defeat of Japan.</p>
                    <p>(The foregoing estimate takes no account of the possibility of a separate
                        peace between Germany and the U.S.S.R. Should a separate peace be made
                        between these two countries more active Soviet interference in China might
                        well be forthcoming, as well as efforts to bring about peace between Japan
                        and China in order for obvious reasons to prolong Japan’s war with the
                        United States and Great Britain.)</p>
                    <p>Existing conditions in China and the probable conditions throughout the Far
                        East at the end of the war make it likely that the Soviet Union will be in a
                        strong position toward achieving its fundamental aims in regard to those
                        areas.</p>

                    <p>1532. According to reliable sources, the next session of the CEC,<note n="37" xml:id="d251fn37">Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.</note>
                        originally scheduled for November, will begin about September 5, agenda to
                        include Kuomintang-Communist relations and selection of new President of
                        National Government. Consideration is also being given to possible adoption
                        of some alteration in governmental structure by providing something in the
                        nature of a democratic appearing façade to meet recent foreign criticism of
                        the administration’s Fascist tendencies. One suggestion along this line is
                        that Presidency be made a position of actual executive authority on either
                        American or former French lines and that there be a Prime Minister and a
                        Cabinet composed of the heads of executive ministries.</p>

                        informed August 26 by General Hu Tsung-nan’s Chief of Staff that no armed
                        conflict with the Communists has recently occurred and that the Central
                        Government still hopes for a political rather than a military solution of

                        forthcoming session of the CEC (Embassy’s 1532, August 21).</p>

                        details thereof, FE believes that you may be interested in FE’s comments on
                        certain aspects of the general situation which would seem to be important in
                        reference to this Government’s formulation of policy.</p>

                    <p rend="center">I</p>
                    <p>In recent months development within the Government of China of an
                        increasingly reactionary type of nationalism has been apparent. This
                        development is marked by suppression of freedom of movement and of
                        expression of thought through expansion of censorship and secret police
                        methods. Conditions exist in which there are inherent factors of potential
                        civil war. Increased propagation of artificial philosophies of national
                        heritage and “destiny”, as enunciated by the leader, and also a growing
                        avoidance of and withdrawal from foreigners have been noted. Economic power
                        is concentrated in a few hands.</p>
                    <p>If this trend toward political and economic nationalism continues, China will
                        become a country where all opposition to a small ruling group will be
                        stifled and where that ruling group, by inculcating suspicion of foreigners,
                        will stand between the people of China and other nations and peoples.
                        Mutually frank relations would be made difficult by narrow-gauge Chinese
                        nationalistic aspirations which include a desire to occupy a role of
                        leadership throughout the Far East and India where nationalism is growing.
                        Our observers in China frequently in recent months have submitted many
                        statements corroborative of the increasingly reactionary character of the
                        Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p rend="center">II</p>
                    <p>The present Government of China is admittedly under the exclusive control of
                        the Kuomintang party of which Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is the “leader”.
                        The Generalissimo through the exercise of balance of power among a group of
                        lesser figures and through his own personal prestige and ability has
                        gathered into his own and his party’s hands the control of much of
                        unoccupied China.</p>
                    <p>This growth of power has been accompanied by an acceleration of chauvinistic
                        natoinalism. Two recent books under the authorship of the Generalissimo are
                        evidence of this attitude. His <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>
                        reflects excessive nationalism, a definite inclination toward reliance on
                        fascist doctrines, and a repudiation of democracy. His <hi rend="italic">Chinese Economics</hi> similarly exhibits ultra nationalism and fascist
                        ideology. These books display an antipathy for and a suspicion of western
                        nations. Both books have been withdrawn from limited circulation, presumably
                        because of realization of the unfavorable repercussions in western countries
                        which would follow their dissemination. On the other hand, in certain
                        passages of the books friendliness toward the United Nations is specifically
                        expressed. Furthermore, in view of the lack of unity and political
                        decentralization which has been conspicuously a source of national weakness
                        in <pb n="324" xml:id="pg_324" facs="0334"/>China, there is something to be
                        said in favor of the emphasis placed in these books on patriotism and the
                        need of developing a cohesive nationalism.</p>
                    <p>The attitude of the Generalissimo and the Kuomintang toward the so-called
                        “Communists” is further evidence of determination to maintain one-party
                        control. The Chinese “Communists” form the only movement in recent years
                        which has openly aspired to a position of national importance rivaling the
                        Kuomintang. Prior to 1937, war was openly waged between the Central
                        Government and the Chinese “Communists”. In the face of Japanese aggression,
                        however, the Kuomintang and the “Communists” formed a common front against
                        Japan. Nevertheless they have failed to evolve a stable relationship. The
                        consensus of observers in China is that eventual renewal of civil war is
                        likely. Today the “Communist” territory is blockaded by several hundred
                        thousand of the best troops in China, and block houses have been erected
                        facing the “Communists”. In justice to the Chinese Government, however, it
                        should be added that, while blockading the Chinese “Communists”, those
                        troops are at the same time guarding a vital part of China from a possible
                        Japanese advance into the northwest.</p>
                    <p rend="center">III</p>
                    <p>There has been pointed out the desirability of bringing into the light points
                        of difference and friction in international affairs. The virus of
                        nationalism in China, with its attendant internal manifestations, with its
                        suspicion and misunderstanding, is capable of becoming a cancer. Perhaps the
                        most important political problems which we shall face in achievement of our
                        policies and objectives in the Far East are (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)
                        internal conditions of China; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) the basic policy
                        aims of Soviet Russia in that area; (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) the relations
                        between Soviet Russia and China; (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) the post-war
                        policies of Great Britain in the Far East; (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) the
                        relations between Great Britain and China and Japan; and (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) Japan’s post-war position in the Far East and the relations
                        between Japan and other Asiatic peoples. The developments in China which
                        have been outlined here most briefly will have a profound effect on all of
                        these problems. The type of nationalism which develops in China can, it is
                        believed, be markedly affected by the policies and programs of this
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>It is hardly to be expected that the tide of growing nationalism among the
                        Chinese, or for that matter among all Asiatics and many colored peoples, can
                        be dissipated. Rather than to attempt to destroy the feeling of nationalism,
                        it would seem to be more desirable to attempt to direct it into healthy
                        channels and to avoid the spread of mutual suspicion and misunderstanding
                        and blind faith in preclusive nationalism.</p>
                    <pb n="325" xml:id="pg_325" facs="0335"/>
                    <p>It is not believed that these developments, which in large part have the
                        character of manifestations of an evolving trend of national development,
                        call for specific action at this moment and no recommendation for action is
                        submitted. It is believed to be highly important, however, that we should
                        all be aware of this trend in the present Government of China in order that
                        problems which arise from time to time may be viewed in their proper
                        perspective.</p>
                    <p>These developments are most important for the long-swing postwar world, and
                        in view of the close interest which the President has in China and in the
                        Far East, it is believed that you may wish at an opportune moment to discuss
                        these developments with the President, not with a view to suggesting any
                        immediate action but merely for the purpose of informing him of the evolving
                        situation and potentialities in China.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Referring to the Embassy’s telegram No. 1483,
                        August 16, 5 p.m. in regard to conditions in Communist-controlled areas in
                        north China, there is enclosed a copy of despatch No. 45 of August 16,
                            1943,<note n="40" xml:id="d256fn40">Not printed.</note> from the
                        Secretary on detail at Sian which served as the basis for the telegram under
                        reference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drumright describes in his despatch a conversation with Mr. Gustav
                        Soderbom, a Swedish subject who has long resided in Inner Mongolia and
                        Peiping and who arrived at Sian in early August after a month’s residence at
                        Yenan en route from Peiping to Chungking.</p>
                    <p>According to Mr. Soderbom, the Chinese Communists control large areas in
                        Hopei and Shansi provinces although they are not active militarily because
                        of a lack of matériel. Their chief source of arms at present is the
                        Japanese-occupied areas where military supplies are purchased from Chinese
                        gun-runners and smuggled into Communist areas. Capture of military equipment
                        from Japanese and Chinese puppet forces, the former source of most of the
                        equipment of the Communist troops, has become increasingly difficult due to
                        lack of military operations as the Japanese are not active in combatting
                        guerrilla operations. The Japanese make only occasional forays into the
                        interior either to seize grain and other loot or to disperse guerrilla <pb n="326" xml:id="pg_326" facs="0336"/>concentrations endangering Japanese
                        positions or communications. Communist troops are relatively well fed and
                        clothed and their spirit is excellent. They appear to be on good terms with
                        the people, taxation and labor conscription being carried out in such an
                        equitable manner that little resentment is created among the populace.
                        Proceeds from the sale of opium grown in Communist areas in Shansi are used
                        to bolster Communist revenues, to support the Communist-issued currency and
                        to purchase commodities in the Japanese-occupied areas. Most of the opium
                        appears to be sold or bartered in enemy-controlled areas.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Soderbom found the atmosphere at Yenan in early July tense due to reports
                        of Chungking troop concentrations in areas surrounding Communist territory.
                        General Chu Teh, commander of the Communist armies, and General Chou En-lai,
                        Communist Party representative at Chungking who arrived at Yenan on July 15,
                        informed Mr. Soderbom that the Chinese Communist Party would not dissolve
                        and that the Communists would resist any Chungking military attack against
                        them. Speeches by Communist leaders at a mass meeting of 8,000 people at
                        Yenan on July 9, at which Mr. Soderbom was present, were characterized by
                        criticism and defiance of and antagonism toward the Central Government and
                        its policies.</p>
                    <p>The description given by this eye-witness of conditions in the Communist
                        areas and of the atmosphere prevailing there appears to give further support
                        to the feeling that the Communists will not willingly give up their
                        government and army and that they are prepared to resist with force any
                        armed attack against them by the Central Government. This readiness to
                        resist Chungking also bears out at least partially the contention of the
                        Communists that this was one of the compelling factors which has brought
                        about a lessening of the tension between the Communists and the Central
                        Government (Embassy’s telegram No. 1325, July 28, 6 p.m.).</p>
                    <p>At the height of the tension between the Communists and the Kuomintang there
                        appeared in the Chinese press in various cities in Free China demands,
                        evidently Kuomintang-inspired, by cultural bodies and other organizations
                        for the dissolution of the Chinese Communist Party (Embassy’s telegrams No.
                        1240, July 21, 9 a.m. and No. 1489 of August 17<note n="41" xml:id="d256fn41">Latter not printed.</note>). Many of these articles
                        referred to the dissension created in the Communist Party by the dissolution
                        of the Comintern.</p>
                    <p>The publication of these articles has ceased within the past two weeks.
                        According to one report, General Pai Chung-hsi brought about the cessation
                        of such articles by informing General Chiang Kai-shek that they were
                        creating an unfavorable impression both in China and abroad. It may also be
                        that the Kuomintang found that this so-called <pb n="327" xml:id="pg_327" facs="0337"/>popular demand for the dissolution of the Communist Party
                        did not achieve the expected results. It is interesting to note that this
                        press campaign is similar to that employed at the time of the disbandment of
                        the New Fourth Army (Communist) in 1941.</p>

                            Eastern Affairs stated: “Mr. Soderbom’s report tends to support the
                            conclusions reached by other foreigners who have recently travelled
                            through the Communist area: The Communists are not active militarily
                            because of a lack of arms; they appear to be on good terms with the
                            people, taxation and labor conscription being carried out in an
                            equitable manner; the opium poppy is grown in Shansi to bolster
                            guerrilla finances; and the Communists show no signs of acquiescing to
                            Central Government threats or intimidation.” (893.00/15134)]</p>

                    <p>1648. The C.E.C. plenary session opened September 6 with Chiang Kai-shek
                        presiding. In his opening address Chiang spoke of confidence in victory, but
                        requested that the session concentrate on the question of postwar
                        reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>Informed Chinese now seem generally of opinion that question of a new
                        President will be resolved by Chiang’s continuing [in] the post of Acting
                        President.</p>

                                <item>Chiang Kai-shek will assume the Presidency and that office
                                        will be given actual and extensive powers, thus legalizing
                                        the personal powers which Chiang now exercises. For example,
                                        the President is to be Commander in Chief of the armed
                                        forces (as Chiang actually now is); is to select and appoint
                                        his own government, including the presidents of the Yuan,
                                        Government Ministers (a power which Chiang now exercises
                                        within the limits of the necessity of maintaining balance
                                        between cliques, et cetera); is to have powers of veto; is
                                        to hold tenure of office for 5 years, may serve 3 terms and
                                        may hold other posts concurrently. These changes are said to
                                        have been devised by the Cheng Hsueh Hsi (Political Science
                                        Group) to reduce the influence of the group which is
                                        reportedly looked upon with disfavor by Mme. Chiang since
                                        her return because of criticism she heard in the United
                                        States of the Fascist trend of the latter’s policies. While
                                        the purpose of the change is thus in part to meet American
                                        criticism that the Chinese Government is undemocratic it
                                        seems clear that the proposed powers to be given Chiang will
                                        actually constitute a legalized dictatorship.</item>

                                    world will so regard them. In support of the Government’s
                                    position an extensive campaign is to be undertaken to publicize
                                    the alleged crimes of the Communists (recent articles and
                                    reports in the Chinese press indicate that this campaign already

                            high military commanders, including chairmen of Sinkiang and Yunnan. The
                            probable primary reason for their presence is to give an appearance of
                            support and unanimity to the elevation of the Generalissimo to the new
                            post of “President with Power.” Inclusion of practically all of the

                            the Communists in case of contingency will be a principal topic for
                            military discussion. There will probably also be discussions regarding

                        September 2, 1943,<note n="42" xml:id="d259fn42">Not printed.</note>
                        submitted by Mr. John S. Service, Second Secretary of Embassy attached to
                        the staff of General Stilwell, reporting statements made by General Teng
                        Pao-shan, Commander of the Central Government’s 22nd Group Army with
                        headquarters at Yulin, Shensi, to General Stilwell regarding
                        Kuomintang-Communist relations.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary of memorandum</hi>. The recent tension between
                            the Central Government forces and Communist troops in the Shensi border
                            areas was due to a misunderstanding, the Chungking troops sent to that
                            area being merely replacements instead of reinforcements as feared by
                            the Communists. With respect to the war against Japan, the situation is
                            fundamentally bad as no effective military action can be taken against
                            the Japanese either in north China or in Inner Mongolia by either
                            faction until military cooperation is achieved. The people in the
                            Communist areas have benefitted by the democratic reforms instituted
                            there and the improved conditions of government. Their morale and that
                            of the Communist troops is good. Because of the strategic importance of
                            north China, it would be desirable for the United States to have
                            American military observers in that area in order to obtain more
                            complete over-all information regarding the Japanese and to bring about
                            needed military cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists,
                            with the possible result of causing the Central Government forces to
                            give attention to military matters rather than to political ones as is
                            true at present. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>With regard to the question of military cooperation, General Teng admits that
                        the present state of virtual immobilization of the forces of both the
                        Communist and the Central Government troops in the border areas has created
                        a fundamentally unsound situation and that, while complete reconciliation
                        between the two factions appears at present to be unattainable, limited
                        cooperation in the military sphere alone might be possible if the Kuomintang
                        can be made to realize the importance of united military action against the
                        Japanese.</p>
                    <p>General Teng explains that the stationing of American military observers in
                        north China, both in the Communist and in adjacent areas, would also
                        indicate to the Central Government the importance the United States attaches
                        to the north China front, and he is of the opinion that their presence might
                        not only result in causing Central Government forces to devote themselves to
                        military rather than political matters but might at the same time provide
                        assurance to the <pb n="330" xml:id="pg_330" facs="0340"/>Communists that
                        their forces engaged in fighting the Japanese would not be stabbed in the
                        back by the Central Government troops.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the possibility of a settlement of Kuomintang-Communist
                        differences, General Teng expresses the opinion that the Communists are
                        willing to accept Kuomintang terms in principle but that they are not
                        convinced of Kuomintang sincerity in regard to the safeguarding of the
                        democratic and governmental gains affected by the Communists in their areas
                        and in the maintenance intact of the experienced and effective Communist
                        guerrilla troops if placed under Kuomintang commanders. He has urged General
                        Chiang Kai-shek, who, he states, desires to preserve peace between the two
                        factions, to send impartial observers to the Communist areas who can give a
                        fair report of conditions there.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Service states in the memorandum that the emphasis given by General Teng
                        to the desirability of stationing American military observers in north China
                        appears to indicate that it was this subject which was the primary purpose
                        for his interview with General Stilwell, the call having been arranged on
                        General Teng’s initiative. (It is interesting that this suggestion that
                        American military observers be stationed in north China has previously come
                        from Communist sources (Embassy’s telegram No. 654, May 6, 10 a.m.) and that
                        this is the first occasion, so far as the Embassy is aware, on which Central
                        Government military authorities have recommended such action.)</p>
                    <p>General Teng is described to the Embassy by Kuomintang critics at Chungking
                        as being of liberal tendencies and as sympathetic toward the Communists. It
                        is unlikely, however, that he is altogether viewed in that light by the
                        Kuomintang in as much as he is entrusted with the leadership of Chungking
                        forces which form the northern side of the blockade maintained around the
                        Communist areas in Shensi and Kansu. Communist sources at Chungking state
                        that General Teng is dependent chiefly on the Communist areas for food
                        supplies for his troops, which may account in part for his more sympathetic
                        attitude toward the Communists. It is also said that he has been summoned to
                        Chungking to report on conditions in Suiyuan where there have been
                        disturbances among the Mongols and that he may be named Chairman of the
                        Kansu Provincial Government to succeed the present Chairman, Ku Cheng-lun,
                        who has aroused much opposition among the Kansu population and who has not
                        been successful in controlling the peasant uprisings in that province.
                        General Teng is a native of Kansu, was formerly Military Governor of that
                        province and would be expected to be more acceptable to the Kansu
                        leaders.</p>

                    <p>1692. General Chiang’s address at September 6 opening of CEC meeting, in
                        which postwar, economic, and political reconstruction are the principal
                        subjects and receive the greatest emphasis, has now been published in full
                        translation by Central News Agency. Following are condensed excerpts: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“Now that final victory is drawing near we at this present plenary
                                session should discuss thoroughly how to build a new, prosperous and
                                strong China. We should center our discussion of the problem of
                                national reconstruction and work out program which may be enforced
                                immediately after the war. Failure in national reconstruction will
                                reduce to naught our victory. This plenary session should deliberate
                                carefully on military, party, political and economic developments
                                and reconstruction based on the Three People’s Principles and make
                                decisions for postwar work.</p>
                            <p>Judging from the latest military situation, especially developments
                                in the Pacific, our final victory will come within one year at the
                                earliest, or after one year at the latest. But no matter whether the
                                war is terminated within one year or after one year, it will not be
                                difficult for us to pull through this. If during the period we do
                                not redouble our efforts to make progress in various fields of work,
                                particularly military, political and economic and make adequate
                                preparations for postwar reconstruction, we shall still fail, when
                                (if) we should have won the war. It is therefore imperative that we
                                redouble our efforts for increasing our power of resistance and
                                simultaneously make preparations for national reconstruction. This
                                is the most important duty of the present plenary session.</p>
                            <p>The task of national reconstruction is manifold. But the most
                                important phase is political reconstruction the foundation of which
                                is enforcement of constitutional government. This plenary session
                                should therefore resolve on the problems of the constitution of the
                                National People’s Assembly and the formulation and promulgation of
                                the constitution in accordance with China’s circumstantial
                                requirements.</p>
                            <p>Secondly, after enforcement of constitutional government, our party
                                should be on equal legal footing with other ordinary parties and the
                                common citizens, and should enjoy equal privileges and rights,
                                fulfill equal obligations and receive equal treatment from the State
                                under the principles of the freedom of assembly organization, speech
                                and publication in accordance with law. But as our party program is
                                national revolution and reconstruction, both historically and
                                morally, it has the responsibility of consolidating the foundation
                                of the State and ensuring the enforcement of our principles. Though
                                our party will be on equal footing with any other party, it will
                                have greater responsibilities as it has a historical revolutionary
                                mission.</p>
                            <pb n="332" xml:id="pg_332" facs="0342"/>
                            <p>Though our economic difficulties are increasing, our economic crisis
                                is already over. Our economic outlook today merits optimism. First,
                                a bounteous harvest through the country has been reaped during the
                                current year. There is no fear of shortage of army and civilian
                                food. Secondly, with a view of helping China overcome her wartime
                                economic difficulties, the United States last year decided to
                                earmark U.S. dollars 200 million of her U. S. dollars 500 million
                                loan to China to be used for combatting inflation, upholding
                                currency, increasing production and stabilizing prices.
                                Consequently, continued worrying over inflation is unwarranted. Our
                                economic situation is by no means without difficulties, but there is
                                absolutely no danger to speak of.</p>
                            <p>There will be no more serious economic crisis in the coming 2 years
                                of continued resistance, and right now we have to begin preparing
                                for postwar reconstruction and the carrying out of Doctor Sun
                                Yatsen’s industrial program, which requires us to set before us two
                                major goals: the industrialization of China and the improvement of
                                [the] people’s livelihood. We shall need foreign investment and
                                technical assistance to consummate our gigantic program of
                                reconstruction. It is therefore desirable that some decision should
                                be reached at the present meeting with regard to foreign trade,
                                international economic cooperation and other related problems.”</p>

                    <p>1693. Chiang’s address (Embassy’s 1692, September 12) is noteworthy for its
                        lack of any direct reference to or emphasis upon need of increasing China’s
                        war effort and indeed its almost complete lack of mention of war against
                        Japan; for its heavy emphasis on national reconstruction as the principal
                        problem facing China; for its unreal and almost fantastic optimism in regard
                        to economic situation; and for its failure to make any reference to
                        Communist problem.</p>
                    <p>Chiang’s reference to constitutional government and democratic rights carries
                        with it significant qualifications. He refers to the “promulgation of
                        Constitution in accordance with China’s circumstantial requirements.” He
                        also states that after the promulgation of constitutional government the Kmt
                        should have equal status with other parties under the “principles of the
                        freedom of assembly, organization, speech and publication in accordance with
                        law”. (It is understood that session has decided that “constitutional
                        government” will be “enforced” 1 year after termination of war.)</p>

                    <p>Chiang is understood to have strongly denounced the Communists during one
                        session of CEC.</p>

                    <p>1695. During a private conversation Wu Teh-chen, Secretary General of CEC,
                        who has been very friendly, asked me what our people at home thought of
                        China’s internal problems. I said there was considerable concern over the
                        continuingly deteriorating economic situation notwithstanding American
                        efforts to be of assistance through credits, stabilization loans and now
                        through supply of gold for free sale and that some quarters wondered why
                        Chinese Government could not control important factors such as hoarding to
                        keep down food costs which were adversely affecting China’s soldiers as well
                        as others. I said there was concern over apparent lack of interest in
                        various Chinese quarters in increasing and making more effective China’s war
                        effort; there was concern over the Kuomintang-Communist differences, over
                        the numerous and apparently increasing Fascist trends (some of which I
                        described) and consequent weakening of practical democracy. I mentioned the
                        increasing restrictions on travel by an increasing surveillance of
                        foreigners.</p>
                    <p>Wu passed over the economic questions, said CEC meeting with its contingent
                        gathering of military leaders had been giving discussion to military
                        situation and inquired as to our attitude toward the Communist situation. I
                        replied that it has always been one of the fundamentals of American policy
                        in Far East that there should be a strong united China; that we accordingly
                        viewed with concern any serious dissension among Chinese people which might
                        militate against establishment and maintenance of a strong unified China
                        especially now as the present differences weakened China’s war effort by
                        causing the immobilization in northwest of large numbers of some of China’s
                        best troops who might better be in Yunnan or on some active front and that
                        the result was that neither these Government troops nor Communist troops
                        being blockaded by them were fighting the Japs.</p>
                    <p>Wu replied readily that this was so and that it was most unfortunate that the
                        situation kept some 20 divisions of good troops including mechanized troops
                        from actively fighting the Japs and he launched into a defense of
                        Government’s “necessary” position vis-à-vis the Communists, emphasizing the
                        valid contention that no national government could tolerate the maintenance
                        by one group of a separate and independent government and army of its own.
                        He said CEC was planning to “appeal” to Communists to keep their 1937
                        promises in hope of resolving the question.</p>

                    <p>He passed over Fascist question with statement that some things were
                        necessary in wartime but China would never become Fascist as the people were
                        fundamentally democratic.</p>
                    <p>I then told him of surveillance and passport difficulties encountered by
                        Americans at Lanchow, of our recent difficulties in getting a visa for
                            Sprouse<note n="43" xml:id="d263fn43">Philip D. Sprouse, Third Secretary
                            of Embassy in China.</note> to make a courier trip there, of the
                        experience of Rice<note n="44" xml:id="d263fn44">Edward E. Rice, Second
                            Secretary of Embassy in China.</note> who before proceeding to his new
                        post at Lanchow had requested usual provincial visas but could obtain a visa
                        for travel only to Lanchow. I said we had hoped that with abolition of
                        extraterritoriality such travel restrictions would be lifted rather than
                        increased and that American officials and other nationals would be accorded
                        in China same generous facilities and treatment accorded Chinese officials
                        and citizens in the United States. Wu said that most certainly this
                        situation should be rectified, that he was very glad I had told him of this
                        and that he would see if he could not do something about it.</p>
                    <p>He added that he hoped we would talk together much more frequently in future
                        and invited me to come to him at any time.</p>

                        Government (Embassy’s 1694, September 12) as it pertains to Chiang Kai-shek
                        who was elected President by the CEC September 13 as follows: <list>

                                Forces gives legal backing to and ensures the continuation of the
                                actual position already held by Chiang as Chairman of the National
                                Military Council.</item>

                                all mandates issued by the National Government represents a further
                                concentration of authority in Chiang’s hands and precludes enactment

                                reelected Chairman. In addition he was reelected President of the

               </p>
                    <p>The effect of the revision is to legalize concentration of power in one man.
                        By virtue of his various offices and personal power, Chiang has actually
                        been holding practically all the power now being delegated to the
                        Presidency. So far as it is known, Chiang has not resigned from any of his

                        administrative control throughout the party.</p>

                            <p>If you share my view, we should maintain the policy of leniency and
                                forbearance which we have consistently pursued in dealing with our
                                domestic affairs with the expectation that the Chinese Communist
                                Party will be moved by our sincerity and magnanimity, no matter in
                                what ways they may slander us, or in what manner they may try to
                                create troubles.</p>
                            <p>In spite of provocations we should abide by the manifesto of the
                                Tenth Plenary Session: ‘In the case of those who sincerely believe
                                in the Three People’s Principles, obey laws and orders, do not
                                hinder prosecution of the war, do not attempt to upset social order,
                                and do not seize our national territory in defiance of government
                                decrees, the Central Government would overlook their past record
                                either in thought or in deed, and should respect their opportunity,
                                be they as individuals or as political groups, to serve the
                                country.’</p>
                            <p>We should make it clear that the Central Government does not have any
                                particular demand to make on the Chinese Communist Party but hopes
                                that it will abandon its policy of forcefully occupying our national
                                territory and give up its past tactics of assaulting national
                                government troops in various sectors; thus obstructing the
                                prosecution of the war.</p>

                    <p>1712. Liberal-minded critics of the Party point out that the CEC resolution
                        regarding future establishment of constitutional government, together with
                        the Standing Committee’s report on which it was based, constitutes chiefly
                        an apologia for the continued deferment of such action by the Kuomintang and
                        is completely defensive in tone, seeking to blame its own failure on
                        Japanese aggression; that while the resolution provides for the convening of
                        the National Congress within 1 year after the war, it requires that those
                        electoral areas and groups which did not hold or complete elections shall
                        elect delegates in accordance with the law, the election to be completed 3
                        months before the convocation of the Congress; and that if it was not
                        possible to complete the election of delegates in peace time in more than 1½
                        years it would not seem likely that under early post-war conditions the
                        election can be completed in 9 months.</p>
                    <p>Adoption of this resolution, which had been anticipated, has not materially
                        increased the hopes of critics of the Kuomintang, who feel that the manner
                        of selection of delegates will be determined by the Party with resultant
                        complete control over the Congress. These critics believe that resolution is
                        chiefly a result of Kuomintang reaction to American criticism of lack of
                        democracy in China (both in the press and to Madame Chiang during her
                        American visit). The resolution is, however, a step forward and may
                        eventually result in making democracy possible even though the Kuomintang
                        now has little if any intention of putting democratic principles into
                        practical effect.</p>

                    <p>1722. The press campaign against the Communists mentioned in our 1644,
                        September 9, appears to be progressing. The Central News <pb n="339" xml:id="pg_339" facs="0349"/>Agency here published September 7, a report
                        from the Shantung Provincial Government charging Communist troops with
                        making unprovoked attacks on Central Government forces in Shantung province
                        during July and August. Kuomintang local Chinese daily September 12
                        published report from Central News Agency, New York, that American papers
                        have given great prominence to and American people have criticized
                        attack.</p>
                    <p>Communists here say troops attacked were former Chungking forces which
                        deserted to Japanese July 4. Communists also charge Chungking with
                        encouraging such defections which (1) solve food and supply problem for the
                        troops defecting, (2) provide opposition to Communists in occupied areas and
                        (3) ensure presence of Chungking forces there when Japanese withdraw. We are
                        reliably informed that Central Government is greatly concerned over
                        extension of Communist control in North China.</p>

                                counter-influences included (1) a telegram from T. V. Soong (which
                                became generally known among the delegates) emphasizing the adverse
                                effect in the United States of civil war in China and (2) advice to
                                Chiang Kai-shek by Chang Chun who pointed out that the Szechuan
                                militarists Teng Hsi-hou, Lui Wen-hui and Pan Wen-hua had not
                                accepted invitation to attend the session and that in the event of
                                civil war their forces would lie astride the line of communications
                                between Chungking and the Communist areas, thus giving them
                                opportunity to capitalize on their opposition to the Central
                                Government. Fu Tso-yi and Ma Hung-kuei, chairmen of the Suiyuan and

                        the CEC sessions corroborated by a statement made on September 10 by another
                        well-informed reliable Chinese who spoke of the “war spirit” of the CEC and
                        expressed fear that a manifesto might be issued tantamount to a virtual
                        declaration of war against the Communists.</p>

                        the extent to which the United States is in a position to influence Chinese
                        Government policy and of the Kuomintang’s intention to liquidate the
                        Communists if and when direct action can be taken without too adverse an
                        effect upon China’s international relations and the party’s internal

                        of the Federation.</p>
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The Federation, which was organized in
                            Hong Kong late in 1941, is said to include the following minority
                            groups: (1) China Youth Party; (2) National Socialist Party; (3) Rural
                            Re-habilitation Group; and (4) National Vocational Education Society. It
                            is not believed to command a large following, its influence being
                            exerted through the speeches and writings of its leaders and the
                            prestige of those leaders. The Kuomintang is not expected to permit the
                            Federation or any other minority groups in China to attain an effective
                            voice in the conduct of the Government.</p>
                        <p>Representatives of the Federation feel, however, that the rapid
                            deterioration of the military, economic and political situation in free
                            China will make it impossible for the present right-wing
                            Kuomintang-dominated Government at Chungking to continue indefinitely in
                            power and that when the crisis comes they wish to have at hand a
                            political platform based on democratic principles which will be
                            acceptable to Kuomintang moderates, Communists, groups within the
                            Federation and non-party Chinese. The political program proposed by the
                            Federation is as follows: (1) In order to establish an actual united
                            front against Japan, a “Council of National Affairs”, as the supreme
                            political organ for the national government, should be established
                            immediately, from which is to be created a “Government of National
                            Defense”. The Council should be composed of 100 members, 40 of them
                            Kuomintang, 20 Communist, 20 Federation and 20 non-party members. (2)
                            The armed forces should be nationalized and freed from party politics.
                            (3) All local and subordinate political administrations should be
                            organized on a simple and rational basis. (4) The intellectuals should
                            first be mobilized in order to effect mobilization of the people in
                            general. (5) Local democratic organizations should be established in
                            order to educate the people in democratic principles of self-government.

                        No. 53, August 28, 1943 from the Embassy officer at Sian in regard to
                        Russian military advisers in Sian.</p>
                    <p>There have been numerous rumors current in recent weeks in regard to the
                        status of the various Russian military advisers in free China (not including
                        Sinkiang—Embassy’s despatch No. 1272, June 19, 1943<note n="49" xml:id="d273fn49">Not printed, but see footnote 80, <ref target="#pg_249">p. 249</ref>.</note>). The consensus of reliable
                        opinion, which is confirmed in part by the Soviet Embassy here, is to the
                        effect that although some of the advisers have recently returned to Russia
                        they have been replaced by new arrivals, but that within the past two or
                        three months all advisers assigned to troops in the field have been
                        transferred to military schools or other institutions where their functions
                        and activities are relatively restricted and unimportant.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: As of possible interest to the Embassy, I
                            have the honor to report the presence in Sian of eight Soviet Union
                            military advisors. According to an official of the “Foreign Affairs
                            Section” of the Bureau of Police, whose function it is to keep a
                            constant check on the movements of foreigners residing in or passing
                            through Sian, these gentlemen are attached to General Hu Tsung-nan’s
                            34th Group Army in Sian. They reside in a hostel maintained by the
                            Chinese authorities.</p>
                        <p>According to foreign missionaries with whom the subject has been
                            discussed, there have been Russian military advisors at Sian for the
                            past four or more years. These informants have the impression that the
                            personnel is changed about once in a year, the advisors in residence
                            returning to the Soviet Union to be replaced by new arrivals. A
                            missionary informant who resided adjacent to the hostel where these
                            advisors were housed for more than two years asserts that they gave the
                            impression of being idle most of the time, seldom leaving their
                            habitation other than to obtain exercise. He states that although he
                            made numerous advances he was unable to strike up an acquaintanceship
                                <pb n="343" xml:id="pg_343" facs="0353"/>with any of them; on one
                            occasion his tender of Bible literature in the Russian language was
                            summarily rejected. Following this incident, according to my informant,
                            the Chinese manager of the hostel made inquiry as to what he was trying
                            to present to the Russians and the motive therefor.</p>
                        <p>It is the consensus of local foreign missionaries that the Russian
                            advisors are very closely watched by the Chinese authorities, that their
                            presence in Sian is viewed with suspicion, and that their functions are
                            nominal only.</p>

                            is now virtually complete. The only important area of the province still
                            under effective Provincial Government control is along the Indochina
                            border west of the Yunnan-Indochina Railway. The power of Y. T. Miao and
                            Lu Ch’ung-jen, two important political figures of Yunnan, has declined
                            in recent months, especially since the appointment in March, 1943, of
                            General Ch’en Ch’eng as commander-in-chief of the Chinese Expeditionary
                            Force in Yunnan.</p>

                    <p>1804. The Third People’s Political Council opened September 18 with 193 of
                        240 delegates in attendance. Although local press announced that members of
                        Communist Party and of all other political parties were present, actually
                        only 5 representatives of minority <pb n="344" xml:id="pg_344" facs="0354"/>parties attended (1 Communist, 1 National Socialist and 3 China Youth
                        Party delegates). The Government had endeavored to obtain large minority
                        party delegation but many minority delegates are reported to have refused to
                        attend, some allegedly fearing to come to Chungking because of the secret
                        police and others feeling that the PPC is under complete Kuomintang control.
                        This attitude toward the PPC seems to have developed largely since last
                        year’s session.</p>
                    <p>On September 21 General Ho Ying-chin during report on military affairs is
                        said to have made bitter attack against the Communists which resulted in the
                        withdrawal of the single Communist delegate from the meeting. The only
                        publicity given to this incident was a report in the local Communist daily
                        that the Communist delegate withdrew from the PPC after his report and would
                        not again attend.</p>
                    <p>The PPC meetings, coming so soon after the CEC session, have been somewhat
                        anti-climactic and are expected to do little more than echo what has been
                        resolved by the CEC. Neutral observers believe that the PPC will emphasize
                        the advent of constitutional government after the war. Wang Chung-hui and
                        Wang Shih-chieh have been elected members of the PPC Presidium, apparently
                        with a view to increasing the prestige of the Council, while Chiang Kai-shek
                        has resigned from the Presidium presumably because of his election to the
                        Presidency of the National Government.</p>
                    <p>We will expect to report further by despatch<note n="52" xml:id="d275fn52">Despatch No. 1676, October 14, not printed; it reported appointment of

                            peasants and the Central Government troops in the Suifu area on July 16.
                            It was not until July 27 that the troops were able to quell the revolt
                                <pb n="345" xml:id="pg_345" facs="0355"/>which was perhaps aided by

                            group. The revolt is described as having been directed against the

                            against thieving by Central Government troops and to have been

                            Brigade”. As an aftermath to the trouble, the Central Government troops
                            methodically searched every farmhouse in the area and took away
                            clothing, bedding and valuables and levied contributions of money from

                    <p>Although the Central Government apparently crushed this revolt against its

                        that of force and that reforms directed toward preventing such outbreaks are

                            the People’s Political council on September 21, General Ho Ying-chin,
                            Chief of Staff and Minister of War, included in his report on military
                            affairs a bitter tirade against the Chinese Communists, accusing them of
                            (1) attacking Central Government troops, (2) violent propaganda against
                            the Kuomintang and the Central Government and personal attacks against
                            Chiang Kai-shek, (3) planting opium poppy and (4) counterfeiting Central
                            Government banknotes. During interpellation time in accordance with
                            fixed rules, the Communist delegate, Mr. Tung Piwu, submitted to General
                            Ho various questions which were in the nature of a refutation of the
                            charges. At the conclusion of the interpellations, three Kuomintang
                            delegates gained the floor and gave support to the charges against the
                            Communists. Mr. Tung thereupon <pb n="346" xml:id="pg_346" facs="0356"/>requested permission to withdraw from the meeting on the grounds that
                            it had devolved into an attack on him and his party and, following the
                            meeting, addressed a letter to the Presidium giving his reasons for
                            withdrawal and stating that he would not continue to take part in the
                            People’s Political Council (General Ho did not answer the questions).
                            The only publicity given to this incident was that in a report in the
                            local Communist daily to the effect that the Communist delegate had
                            withdrawn from the meeting and would not again attend. Mr. Tung states
                            that, prior to the convening of the present session, Dr. Wang
                            Shih-chieh, Secretary-General of the P.P.C., informed him of his strong
                            desire that he (Tung) attend the P.P.C. session and assured him that the
                            meetings would not be made the occasion for an attack on the Communist
                            Party. <hi rend="italic">End of summary.</hi>

                    <p>1864. An official of Cabinet rank, speaking “very privately”, informs us that
                        recent Soviet withdrawal from Sinkiang has been due to only one reason:
                        almost complete <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> between the Sinkiang
                        chairman and the Central Government; that, while the change reflects
                        considerable political success on part of Central Government, consequent
                        economic problems are almost insoluble. He states that an arrangement has
                        been made with the Sinkiang chairman whereby the latter continues to issue
                        and use his own currency pegged at 1 to 5 for National currency, but
                        Sinkiang people will not use National currency even at this rate and
                        Sinkiang currency is not acceptable in China outside of the province, making
                        it impossible for Sinkiang inhabitants to purchase from China quantities of
                        tea (regarded as a necessity), sugar and various consumers’ goods including
                        clothing formerly obtained from Russia. He did not deny or affirm report
                        recently current that the Central Government was purchasing at very high
                        prices a large number of trucks to ship tea, sugar, et cetera, into Sinkiang
                        but said Government was endeavoring to supply some of these articles to the
                        province. He said that about one regiment of Soviet troops still remained at
                        Hami and there were still some Soviet airplanes in Sinkiang. (According to
                        Consul, Tihwa, 300 trucks and 8 airplanes at Hami.)</p>

                            outstanding problems between the Russian and Sinkiang authorities. Most
                            of the 14,000 Russian <hi rend="italic">émigrés</hi> now residing in
                            Sinkiang went there in 1919 and 1920 as part of or accompanying the
                            so-called “White Guard” military forces of Aninkov, Dutov, and one other
                            Russian general. During 1941 a large number were reported to have
                            returned to Russia, perhaps as a result of ill-treatment by the Sinkiang
                            authorities who, since 1930, have inducted some into military service,
                            imprisoned others, and imposed harsh police measures on all.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese authorities refer to the Russian <hi rend="italic">émigrés</hi> as “naturalized persons” and otherwise treat them as
                            if they had no Russian nationality. This circumstance appears to have
                            troubled Soviet consular representatives in Sinkiang who, reflecting the
                            attitude of the Soviet Government in respect to the repatriation of
                            desirable <hi rend="italic">émigrés</hi>, appear either to have
                            facilitated or not to have opposed the escape of some from Chinese

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The review of Chiang Kai-shek’s book is
                            bitterly critical of the Kuomintang, expresses belief that the author of
                                <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi> opposes democracy and states
                            that the viewpoints in the book contradict those of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The
                            article from the Communist daily at Yenan is equally critical of the
                            Kuomintang and charges many Kuomintang members with being traitors.
                            These articles, together with similar articles by Chinese Communist
                            writers distributed in Chungking, apparently mark the beginning of a
                            Communist campaign to expose Kuomintang shortcomings as a means of
                            meeting the recently inaugurated Kuomintang press propaganda campaign to
                            give publicity to Communist “crimes.” Possibilities of any agreement
                            between the two parties are expected to be lessened by the increasing
                            bitterness likely to result from this propaganda war. <hi rend="italic">End of summary.</hi>

                    <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                    <p>It would seem that the Chinese Communist Party is determined to meet the
                        Kuomintang propaganda campaign to expose Communist “crimes” with one
                        intended to give publicity to Kuomintang “crimes.” The Communist delegate to
                        the Third People’s Political Council has informed an officer of the Embassy
                        that the Chinese Communist Party has been forced to take such action
                        because: (1) at the end of June when General Chou En-lai and General Lin
                        Piao returned to Yenan, the Communist Party had assumed that the Kuomintang
                        intended to reach a political settlement of outstanding questions between
                        the two parties, but the concentration of Central Government troops around
                        the Communist areas during early July convinced the Communists that a
                        military solution was the only one envisaged by the Kuomintang; and (2) the
                        Kuomintang had long called the Communists “traitors” and their armies
                        “traitor armies” and had recently begun a press campaign to discredit the
                        Communists and to make a pretense of strong public opinion for the
                        disbandment of the Communist Border Government and its army. Thus in self
                        defense the Communists, who had never directly attacked the Kuomintang in
                        their propaganda, were now forced to retaliate and expose Kuomintang
                        “crimes.”</p>
                    <p>It may be concluded that, in spite of the ostensibly conciliatory policy
                        adopted by the Kuomintang at the time of the C. E. C. Plenary Session in
                        September, a lessening of tension between the Kuomintang and Communist
                        parties is scarcely to be expected if the propaganda campaigns continue with
                        resultant growing bitterness between the two.<note n="57" xml:id="d280fn57">In a memorandum dated November 5 Augustus S. Chase of the Division of
                            Far Eastern Affairs made the following comment: “This despatch describes
                            a newly launched Chinese Communist propaganda campaign against the
                            Kuomintang … A surprising feature of the new campaign is the fact that
                            the Communists appear to have been distributing their propaganda openly
                            at Chungking—even using the local mails.”</note>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a memorandum of a
                        conversation with the Polish Ambassador of October 6, 1943,<note n="58" xml:id="d282fn58">Not printed.</note> in which the latter and his
                        Military Attaché outlined their interpretation of Soviet Russia’s
                        international policies and plans of the past few years and set forth by
                        indirection and implication some argumentation against the setting up by the
                        Allies of a new second front in Europe.</p>
                    <p>We here in this isolated place are scarcely in a position to suggest whether
                        the Polish Ambassador’s and the Polish Military Attaché’s remarks have
                        significance per se. They are of interest to us chiefly because of their
                        propaganda nature and, as the Polish Ambassador usually seizes every
                        possible opportunity to spread propaganda in behalf of Poland and against
                        Soviet Russia, it occurs to us that his activities in this connection may be
                        undertaken by direction and that possibly Polish representatives in other
                        places are engaged in similar activities which are anything but in the
                        general interests of the cause of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy has previously reported how deeply fear and mistrust of Soviet
                        Russia is ingrained in the Chinese official mind and there is no reason to
                        believe that the Polish Ambassador and his Military Attaché are any more
                        restrained in expressing their views to Chinese officials than they were in
                        the conversation under reference. Further poisoning of the Chinese against
                        Soviet Russia (irrespective <pb n="350" xml:id="pg_350" facs="0360"/>of what
                        foundation may exist for some of the views expressed) is definitely
                        detrimental to our general cause in this theatre. There is plentiful
                        evidence already of the detriment to China’s war effort (which at best has
                        been and continues to be negative) consequent upon China’s suspicion and
                        resentment against Great Britain and Soviet Russia. We accordingly raise,
                        for consideration, the question whether it might not be advisable for the
                        British Government to endeavor to impress upon the Polish Government the
                        desirability that Polish representatives refrain from activities which tend
                        to vitiate, rather than give affirmative inspiration to, such inclination as
                        the Chinese Government may have toward effectively contributing further
                        within its capacities to the war against Japan. As the Department is aware,
                        the long-standing difficulties between the Kuomintang and the Chinese
                        Communists (which in the Chinese mind have more and more become integrated
                        with Chinese apprehension in regard to possible Soviet Russian designs upon
                        Manchuria and north China) continue to immobilize some of the best divisions
                        of the Central Government’s armies and are an important contributing factor

                        despatch no. 1430 of August 4, 1943 and considers the despatch an excellent
                        piece of reporting on the part of Mr. Sprouse, Third Secretary of the
                        Embassy. The information contained in the despatch and its enclosures<note n="60" xml:id="d283fn60">Enclosures not printed.</note> and Mr.
                        Sprouse’s interpretative comment constitute a very useful contribution
                        toward the Department’s understanding of recent developments in relations
                        between the Chinese (Kuomintang) Government and the Chinese Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Department is confident that the Embassy will continue to follow closely
                        and discreetly developments between the Kuomintang and the Communists.
                        Special note is taken of the suggestion in the despatch prepared by Mr.
                        Sprouse regarding the possibility that “Central Government control over the
                        areas now under its authority” might “become so weakened through local
                        dissension as to make any such areas susceptible to Communist propaganda …”
                        The Embassy <pb n="351" xml:id="pg_351" facs="0361"/>will of course report
                        available information in this regard and information in general with regard

                            General Chiang Kai-shek at the C.E.C. Session and in the resolution
                            adopted by the C.E.C. on the Communist question, is outwardly
                            conciliatory. Other indications are that, while there has been no change
                            in the military situation in the border region, relations between the
                            two parties have worsened, those indications being comprised in the
                            bitter propaganda campaign now being carried on by both the Kuomintang
                            and the Communist Party (Embassy’s despatch 1651 of October 6), the
                            attack made on the Communist Party by the Minister of War at the Third
                            People’s Political Council in September, the resolution adopted by the
                            P.P.C. on the question of the Communist army, the reduction of the
                            number of Communist Party representatives at Chungking and the reported
                            recently instituted close surveillance by Kuomintang secret police of
                            those representatives. It is generally believed that the Central
                            Government is committed to a policy of liquidation of the Chinese
                            Communist Party by one means or the other and that this policy will be
                            carried out if and when the Kuomintang decides that it can be achieved
                            without too great danger to its internal position and to China’s
                            international position. The peaceful settlement of the Communist problem
                            and the ascendancy of liberal elements over Communist and Fascist groups
                            in China are matters of serious concern to the United States. <hi rend="italic">End of summary.</hi>

                        political problem to be solved by political means. They emphasize the
                        failure of the Chinese Communist Party to fulfill the promises made in its
                        manifesto of September 22, 1937,<note n="64" xml:id="d285fn64">For text, see

                        is said to have agreed (1) to struggle for the thorough realization of Dr.
                        Sun Yat-sen’s Three People’s Principles; (2) to abandon its policy of
                        attempting to overthrow the Kuomin-tang’s political power; (3) to abolish
                        its soviet form of government and “to realize political democracy”, thus
                        helping to bring about the political unity of the nation; and (4) to
                        reorganize the Chinese Red Army into a national revolutionary army under the
                        command of the National Military Council, the army to await orders to move
                        to the front to fight the Japanese. The Communists affirm that they have
                        carried out these promises and that the promise “to realize political
                        democracy” has been fulfilled in areas under Communist control in that a
                        democratic form of government has been established in those areas under
                        which one-third of the representation in the government is Communist,
                        one-third Kuomintang and one-third members without party affiliation. They
                        add that this promise envisaged the establishment of similar governmental
                        forms in the Kuomintang-controlled <pb n="353" xml:id="pg_353" facs="0363"/>areas and that this idea was implicit in the statement that the Communist
                        Party would “realize political democracy in the hope that the political
                        power (of the people) of the whole nation might be unified.” They point out
                        that their armies have opposed the Japanese since the beginning of the war,
                        without receiving any military supplies and drugs from the Central
                        Government since the end of 1938 and without governmental subsidies since
                        1939.</p>
                    <p>In General Chiang’s instructions and in the C. E. C. resolution the Communist
                        Party is accused of sabotaging the war effort and of endangering the
                        security of the state and the tolerant attitude of the Kuomintang is pointed
                        to, as shown in the manifesto issued by the 10th Plenary Session of the C.
                        E. C. in November 1942 in which the C. E. C. declared that the Central
                        Government was prepared to overlook the past record, either in thought or in
                        deed, and would respect the opportunity of individuals or political groups
                        to serve their country.</p>
                    <p>The Minister of Information on several occasions during recent months has
                        bitterly attacked the Communists at his weekly press conferences. In reply
                        to a question from newspaper correspondents at a press conference shortly
                        after the conclusion of the C. E. C. Session in regard to the measures to be
                        adopted to solve the Communist problem if political means failed, the
                        Minister stated that the Kuomintang would seek a solution on the basis of
                        the resolution passed and of the views expressed by General Chiang and that
                        it was hoped that the Chinese Communists would place national interests
                        above those of their party and would not hinder the prosecution of the
                        war.</p>
                    <p>The Central Government has recently charged the Communists with attacking
                        Chungking troops instead of engaging in operations against the Japanese (as
                        in General Chiang’s instructions to the C. E. C. and the Kuomintang press
                        propaganda campaign against the Communists). This was one of the charges
                        made by General Ho Ying-chin, Chief of Staff and Minister of War, during the
                        recently concluded session of the Third People’s Political Council
                        (Embassy’s telegram No. 1804, September 25, 2 p.m.). Mr. Tung Pi-wu, the
                        Communist delegate to the P. P. C. in denying at the P. P. C. session the
                        truth of the charge, pointed to the existence in General Ho’s files of
                        letters from his commanders in the field reporting that Communist troops had
                        on the occasions mentioned by Ho come to the assistance of the Chungking
                        troops and had aided them in repulsing the Japanese. The Communists also
                        state that the recent report that the Communist troops had attacked Central
                        Government troops in Shantung (Embassy’s telegram No. 1722, September 15, 4
                        p.m.) was without foundation, that these troops were former Chungking forces
                        which had deserted to the Japanese in early July previous to the attack <pb n="354" xml:id="pg_354" facs="0364"/>made on them by the Communists and
                        that the headquarters of the Shantung Provincial Government at Chungking had
                        never received such a report and was completely surprised to see the report
                        published. According to the Communists, the Kuomintang fears that the end of
                        the war may find the Communist troops rather than Central Government forces
                        in control in those areas of north China from which the Japanese withdraw
                        and that the Central Government may not be sufficiently strong to oppose
                        them successfully. In this connection, the Communists charge that the
                        Chungking authorities are now encouraging defections from their own
                        (Kuomintang) troops to the Japanese in north China as a means of providing
                        opposition to the Communist forces, of solving the supply and food problem
                        and of having their own troops in that area at the end of the war following
                        Japanese withdrawals.</p>

                    <p>General Chiang’s instructions to the C. E. C. and the C. E. C. manifesto,
                        coming at a time when there were fears of a Kuomintang ultimatum to the
                        Chinese Communist Party, served to ease the tension momentarily and in a
                        relative sense but it is an uneasy truce which continues to exist. (Generals
                        Hu Tsung-nan, Deputy Commander of the 8th War Zone, Fu Tso-yi, Chairman of
                        the Suiyuan Provincial Government and Commander of the Chinese Forces in
                        Suiyuan, Ma Hung-kuei, Chairman of the Ninghsia Provincial Government, Chang
                        Chih-chung, Chief of the Political Training Board of the National Military
                        Council, and Chiang Ting-wen, Commander of the 1st War Zone, were all
                        reportedly summoned to Chungking by General Chiang Kai-shek on very short
                        notice at the time of C. E. C. session in September to participate in
                        military conferences which are believed to have been related to possible
                        action against the Communists.) Neither of the two parties seems willing to
                        make concessions necessary to bring about an agreement. Such concessions on
                        the part of the Communists would certainly entail the removal of the
                        Communist army from the area it now occupies and its incorporation into
                        other units of the Central Government forces, probably scattered over the
                        entire country. The governmental power would be expected to be placed under
                        Kuomintang control as is the case in other parts of free China, for it is
                        not likely that the Communists would be permitted to retain any voice in the
                        Government in their present areas unless that voice were backed by armed
                        force—a force which would be lost with the relinquishment of its army.
                        Kuomintang concessions, according to Communist sources, would entail the
                        establishment of some form of representative government in which the
                        Communist Party and other minority groups would have a share. It would also
                        require freedom of <pb n="355" xml:id="pg_355" facs="0365"/>speech, of
                        assembly and of the press—i.e. guarantees of security for the
                        Communists.</p>
                    <p>It is debatable what the result of such a move would be at the present
                        moment. Many liberal Chinese in addition to the Communists insist that
                        establishment of a truly representative government would not necessarily
                        entail the loss of a dominant voice in the Government by the Kuomintang but
                        that it would mean the elimination of the oppressive and corrupt practices
                        in which the Kuomintang now indulges in order to enable it to hold its
                        power; that such a move would result in a greater spirit of unity on the
                        part of the people and a genuine whole-hearted support of the war effort and
                        of the Government. The Kuomintang on the other hand points to the unrest
                        already existing and fears that without the strong controls now in existence
                        chaos would result and that too much freedom at the present moment might
                        lead to disruptive tendencies with every individual and every group trying
                        to make its voice heard. The result is that there seems to be no common
                        meeting ground for the two parties. The Kuomintang, therefore, continues to
                        maintain its blockade of Communist-occupied territories, asserting that the
                        slightest relaxation of that blockade will mean the extension of Communist
                        control over adjacent areas. It employs the blockade both as a form of
                        pressure on the Communist Party for the acceptance of the Kuomintang demands
                        and as a preventive of the extension of Communist control.</p>

                            Situation</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>The Communists state that General Ho Ying-chin’s attack on the Communists is
                        but one phase of the propaganda campaign decided upon by the Kuomintang to
                        publicize and expose Communist “crimes”. Mr. Tung Pi-wu warns that further
                        reports of this type are to be expected in the future and that many of them
                        will come from provincial, municipal and hsien assemblies. He asserts that
                        the occasion of General Ho’s attack was the first time since the
                        organization of the P. P. C. that the Communists had thus been openly
                        attacked, although an effort had been made to initiate such an attack during
                        the P. P. C. session in 1942—an effort which was forestalled by his (Tung’s)
                        prompt protest. Mr. Tung states that General Chiang Kai-shek purports to
                        feel that the Communist question is purely a domestic problem and that
                        foreign opinion in this matter should be disregarded. He asserts that
                        General Chiang has so informed his associates and has stated that in any
                        event the American and British Governments are capitalist regimes which have
                        no regard for the Communists. Mr. Tung is of the opinion that as matters now
                        stand the situation is generally worse than at any time since the crisis in
                        July of this year when the Central Government concentrated additional troops
                        around the Communist <pb n="356" xml:id="pg_356" facs="0366"/>areas in
                        Shensi. He expresses the belief, however, that General Chiang does give
                        consideration to foreign opinion regarding the Communist problem in spite of
                        his apparent indifference, He adds that the question of the Szechuan
                        militarists also enters into any estimate of the situation and that the
                        Central Government has recently moved an army corps from Paochi, Shensi, to
                        Tahsien, eastern Szechuan, to provide for eventualities in the event of a
                        Kuomintang-Communist conflict.</p>
                    <p>Communist sources state that General Chou En-lai, the Communist
                        representative who left for Yenan at the end of June, will not return to
                        Chungking in the immediate future and that the question of his return may
                        well serve as a barometer of improved relations between the Kuomintang and
                        the Communists. It is to be noted that the Communist Party representation at
                        Chungking has been reduced and that there remains only a minimum number
                        considered essential in the operation of the 18th Group Army Headquarters
                        and of General Chou’s office and in the publication of the Communist daily
                        and bi-monthly magazine. The Communists also state that following the
                        withdrawal of Mr. Tung from the P.P.C. session their representatives have
                        been under close surveillance by the Kuomintang secret police and that one
                        non-Communist Chinese who was seen talking to Communist members on the
                        street was followed and warned by the secret police that serious
                        consequences could be expected if she were again found with Communists.</p>

                        Russia</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>In the background of the situation is inevitably present a deep-seated
                        Chinese fear and suspicion of Soviet Russia and its intentions with regard
                        both to the Chinese Communists and the Northeastern Provinces. (The Embassy
                        has reported on this subject on a number of occasions.) That the Russians
                        are not altogether disinterested in the Chinese Communist Party is evident
                        from the call made in July at the American Embassy by representatives of the
                        Soviet Embassy at Chungking who expressed Soviet concern over the
                        possibilities of civil war between the Central Government and the Communist
                        Party (Embassy’s telegram No. 1183, July 14, 12 noon). This fear gives added
                        reason for the Kuomintang to wish to dispose of the Communist question
                        before the conclusion of the war in order that a post-war Kuomintang-Chinese
                        Communist struggle for control in north China may not occur. Even should
                        Soviet Russia remain outside the war against Japan, there would exist the
                        possibility of Russian assistance, outright or under cover, to the Chinese
                        Communists.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Possibilities of Civil War</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>All these factors point to but one conclusion to the continued struggle
                        between the two rival parties—civil war at some undetermined future date.
                        Whether it will come prior to the conclusion of the war against Japan or
                        after that date would seem to depend largely upon the Kuomintang’s estimate
                        of the possibilities of success. If the Kuomintang believes that it can
                        embark upon such a campaign with chances of rapid success, it is possible
                        that it will not await the end of the war against Japan. The end of the war
                        in Europe will find a militarily-strong Soviet Russia which may be expected
                        to take an active interest in the Far Eastern situation. That interest is
                        likely to include the Chinese Communists and every day that passes brings
                        nearer the possibility of Russian interference in the Communist situation in
                        China. The Kuomintang may feel that the present offers the greatest chance
                        of non-interference from the American and British Governments which might be
                        expected to exert no great pressure against such a move because of a desire
                        to keep China in the war. There would seem to be more arguments against the
                        advisability of launching into civil war in the post-war period provided the
                        Kuomintang should feel that it could successfully carry through such a
                        campaign prior to that time. The present propaganda campaign against the
                        Communists is expected by the Kuomintang to build up a picture of an
                        obstructionist and disobedient Communist Party which is hindering the
                        prosecution of the war against Japan and is in well nigh open revolt against
                        the legally constituted government of China, contrary to the wishes of the
                        people—a propaganda campaign which is perhaps a necessary prelude to
                        outright action against the Communists.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy feels that the chief danger in the situation lies in a possible
                        miscalculation by the Kuomintang of its chances of success if its armies
                        attack the Communists. The Kuomintang may consider that it is strong enough
                        to accomplish its objective—the liquidation of the Communists—before the end
                        of the war. (In this connection, the Secretary of Embassy at Sian has
                        recently reported that Central Government military officials there seem for
                        the most part to make light of the military strength of the Communists,
                        especially in respect to military equipment and supplies. They seem to
                        suggest that the Chinese Communist forces, at least those in north Shensi,
                        could be liquidated speedily and easily.) Indications are that the result of
                        civil war in the near future would be the end of what little affirmative
                        contributory war effort is now being made by China. The dissident provincial
                        elements, such as the Szechuan militarists (whose possible <pb n="358" xml:id="pg_358" facs="0368"/>opposition was reportedly one of the
                        reasons for the failure of the C. E. C. to issue an ultimatum against the
                        Communists in September), are not likely to neglect an opportunity to “fish
                        in muddy waters” and utter chaos might well result. The general condition of
                        Central Government troops, suffering from malnutrition and insufficient
                        medical attention and in many cases lacking—through long inactivity—the
                        spirit to fight, would necessarily be a factor in any campaign against
                        Communist troops, who are described by Central Government military officials
                        as well led and trained, disciplined and of good fighting spirit but lacking
                        military equipment in all categories.</p>
                    <p>The possible alternatives to any civil war in China may be (1) a compromise
                        between the two rival parties, which, gained under the pretext of democracy,
                        might serve through the limited exercise of such principles to prevent the
                        spread of Communism in China or (2) the carrying out by the Kuomintang of
                        democratic reforms, particularly in the agrarian field, designed to deprive
                        the Chinese Communist Party of one of its greatest sources of popular appeal
                        among the peasants. (The Communist Party’s present strength has perhaps
                        resulted largely from the failure of the Central Government to take any
                        effective measures of agrarian reform and the Communist movement as at
                        present constituted in its non-industrialized bases is chiefly a symbol of
                        agrarian protest.)</p>
                    <p>It is of importance to the United States that there emerges a new China which
                        will be friendly to the United States and which will not be torn by civil
                        strife nor controlled by reactionary ultra-chauvinistic elements. There
                        already exist among these powerful elements suspicion of western ideas and
                        influence and some latent anti-foreign-ism which under their direction could
                        readily be encouraged and extended over the country. If civil war is
                        prevented and if the Kuomintang is forced by virtue of circumstances to give
                        way to demands for reforms or for the broadening of the base of the
                        government with resultant liberalizing influence, China may be saved both
                        from Communism and from the perhaps worse evil of the Chinese brand of
                        Fascism which masquerades under Sun Yat-sen’s San Min Chu I. Fascist
                        tendencies of this kind are becoming more and more evident. A solution of
                        the Kuomintang-Communist problem which will avert civil war and by
                        liberalizing the present regime lessen the influence of the reactionary
                        elements now in power would provide a solution greatly to the advantage of
                        the United States in the light of its long-term interests.</p>

                        <p>Our holy war against aggression having passed through its most critical
                            stage after 6 long years, the victory anticipated by the whole nation is
                            already in sight. In order to ensure lasting freedom and welfare for the
                            country and final triumph over aggression, the Government is firmly
                            convinced that unless national unity is placed on a solid foundation, it
                            is next to impossible to carry out successfully our program of
                            resistance and reconstruction. Bearing in mind this guiding principle,
                            the Government sincerely hopes that the Chinese Communist Party will
                            refrain from committing acts undermining national unity and obstructing
                            the prosecution of our war. It is with this purpose in view that the
                            Government has consistently taken an attitude of forbearance towards the
                            said Party Animated, now as ever, by the same spirit, we do hereby
                            resolve to entrust the Standing Committee with the task of settling this
                            matter and of persuading in an appropriate manner the Chinese Communists
                            to realize their past mistakes and honestly redeem the pledge made in
                            their declaration of September 22nd, 1937, namely “(1) To struggle for
                            the realization of the Three People’s Principles; (2) To abandon the
                            policy of creating disturbance and propagating the communist movement;
                            (3) To dissolve the present Soviet government, thus helping to bring
                            about the political unity of the whole nation; (4) To disband the Red
                            Army by incorporating it in the National Army under the direct command
                            of the Military Council of the National Government.[”] In this way,
                            national interests will be safeguarded, military orders and government
                            decrees carried out, victory in our war of resistance and success in our
                            reconstruction work assured, so that the fervent hope of the people may
                            be fully realized. As the Plenary Session has resolved to convoke the
                            National Congress within one year after the cessation <pb n="360" xml:id="pg_360" facs="0370"/>of hostilities to make and promulgate a
                            constitution, all other problems can be discussed and solved in that
                            Congress. The present session of the Central Executive Committee, while
                            resolutely striving for the consummation of its fixed policy unifying
                            the country and safeguarding the victory of war, hereby reiterates to
                            the Chinese Communist Party its most earnest and sincere
                            expectations.</p>

                        of October 14, 1943, in regard to Kuomintang-Communist relations, I have the
                        honor to enclose a copy of despatch No. 51 of August 27, 1943, from the
                        Secretary on detail at Sian<note n="67" xml:id="d286fn67">Not

                        Kun-kang, Chief of Staff to General Hu Tsung-nan, Deputy Commander of the

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. According to the despatch. General Li
                            denies the rumors of Central Government troop concentrations in July on
                            the boundaries of the Border Region in Shensi and states that there has
                            not been and not now is there any intention on the part of the Central
                            Government of using military force against the Communists. General Li is
                            said to feel that the Central Government’s policy is to seek a political
                            solution of the Communist problem but he admits that the Chinese
                            Communists will not be willing to disband their organizations. It is
                            General Li’s professed opinion that the Communists are weak, militarily
                            and economically, that they do not enjoy the support of the people in
                            the areas which they control and that they are not active militarily
                            against the Japanese. Mr. Drumright adds that he has been unable to
                            confirm that the Central Government troops concentrations against the
                            Communist Border Region in July were anything more than replacement
                            transfers. <hi rend="italic">End of summary.</hi>

                    <p>Central Government officials at Chungking who have discussed the matter with
                        the Embassy have admitted the concentration of Chungking troops in Shensi
                        during July, explaining it as a measure of pressure on the Communists for
                        acceptance of Kuomintang terms (Embassy’s telegrams No. 1136, July 9, 4
                        p.m.; No. 1173, July 13, 4 p.m.; and No. 1214, July 17, 6 [<hi rend="italic">3</hi>] p.m.)</p>
                    <p>Denials of these reports have come from General Hu Tsung-nan himself, who was
                        the commander of the Central Government forces in question, from General
                        Chang Chih-chung, who denied even the concentration of any troops, and from
                        various officials at Sian. Whether or not the concentrations represented an
                        increase in the number of <pb n="361" xml:id="pg_361" facs="0371"/>troops
                        participating in the blockade of the Communist-controlled areas or merely
                        replacement transfers, the purpose seems to have been an effort to impel
                        Communist acceptance of Central Government demands and perhaps partially to
                        prevent extension of Communist control in areas adjacent to their present
                        territory.</p>

                        Chiang referred to Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s policy of building up the Republic of
                        China: China should fulfil the obligations and enjoy the rights of a
                        civilized nation and should foster closer relations with friendly nations on
                        the principle of peace with a view to elevating China’s position in the
                        family of nations and realizing the ideal of universal brotherhood; the
                        territories of the Hans, Manchus, Mongols, Muslims and Tibetans should be
                        welded together into one country and merged into one nation; and China
                        should establish a republican form of government, improve the people’s
                        livelihood and fulfil the high aspirations of the nation through the
                        consummation of the revolution. President Chiang stated that China was now
                        engaged in a war in pursuance of this consistent policy. He explained how
                        the Chinese people must exert themselves in order to establish a democratic
                        government and pointed to the important prerequisite to the realization of
                        the “Principle of Democracy”: the democratic spirit lies in the observance
                        of law and discipline and the Chinese people should grasp fully the true
                        meaning of freedom and government by law and cultivate the habit of
                        respecting freedom and observing law and discipline.</p>

                    <p>1989. Consul [at] Tihwa reports that oh October 16 he was told by Foreign
                        Affairs delegate that Soviets have fixed price for Toutungho installation at
                        U.S. [$] 5,296,600; that formal negotiations not yet undertaken; that 200 of

                        at Tushan; that delegate has protested to local USSR Consul General and that
                        Soviets have withdrawn from Wusu airfield but not from Ining and Toutungho
                        fields. Consul surmises that Soviets intend to retain troops at Toutungho
                        and Tushan until final arrangements for handing over of installations to

                    <p>1995. At his first press conference October 20 Liang Han-chao, newly
                        appointed Minister of Information as successor to Chang Tao-fan, stated
                        there will not be a civil war in China and that possibility of Kuomintang
                        leading nation at war against Chinese Communists does not exist at all
                        “since we are all engaged in the supreme task of defeating the enemy and
                        winning the war.” He said attitude of Kuomintang toward Chinese Communists
                        can be summed up by President Chiang’s message to CEC in September and that
                        rumors of civil war has origin in oversensitiveness or ulterior designs of
                        Chinese Communists to achieve certain political aims with hope of bringing
                        about <pb n="364" xml:id="pg_364" facs="0374"/>solidarity within their
                        party. Liang expressed opinion that Chinese Communist attitude toward
                        Kuomintang and Central Government has been moderated since PPC session in
                        September.</p>

                        Kai-shek as President of the National Government, I have the honor to

                        on detail at Chengtu regarding the reaction at that city to the acceptance

                            be expected, there was little local enthusiasm shown over the
                            Generalissimo’s acceptance of the Presidency. Some nine thousand
                            students of the Central Military Academy “spontaneously” demonstrated
                            their enthusiasm in a parade through part of the city and there was a
                            Kuomintang inspired fire-cracker celebration in the main business
                            section.</p>
                        <quote rend="blockquote">

                                enthusiasm over the Generalissimo’s assumption of the Presidency

                                political observers expressed gleeful admiration of the manner in

                                not, enhance the Generalissimo’s personal and political prestige in

                            Government, made a special occasion to tell me with great glee and
                            admiration of the clever manner in which the Generalissimo had managed
                            to take the appointment without offending Wang Chung-hui<note n="73" xml:id="d292fn73">Secretary General of the Chinese Supreme National

                            the two other principal aspirants for the Presidency. They say that the
                            Generalissimo called Wang Chung-hui in to see him and asked him to
                            prepare most carefully a list of the functions, powers and
                            responsibilities he thought the man acting as President should have.
                            Wang returned to his home and after two days of hard work produced a
                            most formidable list. The Generalissimo, after studying it carefully,
                            remarked that it was a masterly piece of work and that he was in
                            complete agreement with it, but one thing worried him. It was obvious
                            that whoever accepted such great responsibilities could not possibly be
                            spared to represent China at the Peace Conference. Wang Chung-hui
                            reluctantly agreed. Then the Generalissimo asked Wang who he thought was
                            the best fitted for the Presidency. Wang replied immediately that he
                            thought the Generalissimo should take the Post. The Generalissimo said
                            that, in his own opinion, Wang himself was the ideal man for the
                            position, but, in view of the great need to have Wang free to represent
                            China adequately at the Peace Conference, the Generalissimo would
                            reluctantly agree to accept the responsibilities of the Presidency
                            himself. Wang is said to have left the interview almost as happy over
                            the promise of future glory as he might have been if his expectations of
                            appointment to the Presidency had been realized. The Generalissimo then
                            called the two other leading aspirants for the position in to see him,
                            and showed them what he called “Wang Chung-hui’s list” and asked them
                            whether they had any criticism or suggestions. They offered no criticism
                            but, being thus convinced that Wang Chung-hui had the inside track for
                            the appointment, urged the Generalissimo to accept the position himself
                            as the only man fitted to hold such a responsible position. The
                            Generalissimo finally agreed with them with apparent reluctance, sending
                            them away satisfied that even if neither of them had received the
                            appointment, they had prevented Wang Chung-hui from getting it and
                            making a life-time job of it. They could each nourish the hope that,
                            when time came for the Generalissimo to relinquish the post, it would
                            fall to them.</p>
                        <p>Having thus disposed smoothly of the leading aspirants for the position
                            the Generalissimo is said to have appointed Ex-[<hi rend="italic">the
                                late</hi>] President Lin Sen’s chief assistant to serve as Mayor of
                            Chungking <pb n="366" xml:id="pg_366" facs="0376"/>and to have placed
                            the deposed mayor in charge of the Presidential Office—thus disposing
                            effectively of the problem of “hang-over staff”.</p>
                        <p>Many Szechuanese resent what they consider to be “poaching” on their
                            private political preserves but even they seem to highly admire and
                            privately laud the Generalissimo’s political acumen and skill. The
                            admiration that such stories elicit is a real political force, whether
                            or not the stories are true. The political prestige of the Central
                            Government in Chengtu is considerably enhanced by the personal respect
                            that is felt for the Generalissimo. Stories of his cleverness in
                            dominating people and of his political foresight are favorite topics of
                            conversations in Chengtu tea shops, along with bitter gossip about the

                            of the Sian office of the Military Affairs Commission, has succeeded
                            General Yuan Pu as Garrison Commander of Sian, a change apparently
                            brought about by General Hu Tsung-nan. General Hu, the most important
                            military figure in the Sian area, has gradually centralized power in his
                            hands to such an extent that General Hsiung Pin, Chairman of the Shensi
                            Provincial Government, finds the civil administration of the province
                            hampered by military interference, demands and exactions. The demands of
                            General Hu’s armies for food and clothing have led to economic control
                            and although Hu himself is said to be incorrupt his officers have
                            engaged in malpractices in connection with taxation, conscription and
                            bribery. There is doubt as to the wisdom of stationing certain armies
                            and commanders in a given area over a period of years in view of the

                    <p>The Organic Law of the Committee, which was established by the Supreme
                        National Defense Council, provides for the membership to be appointed by the
                        Council from the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the
                        Kuomintang, from members of the People’s Political Council (members of its

                        with experience in political affairs and constitutional government.
                        Functions of the Committee are (1) to submit to the Government proposals
                        concerning constitutional government; (2) to investigate local organs of

               </p>
                    <p>The Committee is composed of 54 members, including the Chairman and the seven
                        members of the P.P.C. Presidium. Forty-six of this number were nominated by
                        President Chiang for appointment by the Supreme National Defense Council. Of
                        the membership of the Committee approximately 35 are Kuomintang members,
                        about 10 are members of independent minority groups and the remainder are
                        without party affiliation. The majority of the latter, however, are expected
                        to support the Kuomintang in view of their past record, some of them being
                        bound by personal allegiance to President Chiang.</p>
                    <p>Moderate groups appear to have been given a dominant share in the Committee
                        and the known representation of the reactionary CC clique is less than the
                        total of the Political Science Group and Dr. Sun Fo’s followers. A number of
                        scholars and lawyers have been <pb n="369" xml:id="pg_369" facs="0379"/>named to the Committee. Only one military representative, General Hsiung
                        Shih-hui, has been placed on the Committee, and he is considered a member of
                        the Political Science Group.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>The lack of support given by the minority party leaders to the P.P.C. during
                        its session in September (there was negligible minority party representation
                        in attendance) nullified the efforts of the Kuomintang to point to the
                        increasing popular support behind the P.P.C. and increased existing doubts
                        regarding the real attitude of the Kuomintang toward constitutional
                        government. Therefore, prior to the establishment of the Committee
                        discussions between the Kuomintang and the minority groups (except for the
                        Communist Party) centered around the questions of legalization of minority
                        political parties and the establishment of a committee independent from the
                        P.P.C. to deal with matters relating to constitutional government. The
                        result was the placing of the Committee under the Supreme National Defense
                        Council which, while purely Kuomintang, is less obviously political than the
                        Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and in theory is the highest
                        organ governing the nation. The minority groups then insisted that their
                        leaders or chosen delegates be named members of the Committee as
                        representatives of their parties and that all minority parties be given
                        representation. A list of members submitted by the minority party leaders to
                        President Chiang was not, however, agreed to and three outstanding minority
                        leaders were not appointed. Those appointed were named as experts or as
                        members of the P.P.C. and not as representatives of their parties. The
                        minority parties feel that the Kuomintang is attempting to break up their
                        united front by the elimination of the three appointees requested.</p>

                    <p>According to reliable reports the Communist Party was not consulted with

                    <p>As a result of the controversy, the minority parties are now reported to be
                        unwilling to cooperate with the Committee and to have taken the position
                        that they will not participate unless all minor groups are appropriately
                        represented. The consequence of the criticism and controversy is that the
                        Committee which is actually more moderate in composition than might have
                        been expected or hoped for is hampered at the outset by political bickering.
                        This circumstance will likely not only lessen the effectiveness of the
                        Committee but will also make more evident, if not more voluble, the
                        suspicion between the Kuomintang and the minor opposition groups.<note n="78" xml:id="d295fn78">In a memorandum dated February 22, 1944, Troy
                            L. Perkins of the Division of Chinese Affairs commented: “It is
                            interesting to note that the minority parties, because they are not
                            appropriately represented, are now reported to be unwilling to cooperate
                            with the Committee, apparently in the hope that a show of independence
                            may strengthen their position and even lead to the legalization of
                            minority parties. This may indicate that some non-Kuomintang and liberal
                            leaders see a possibility that the one-party monopoly can be effectively
                            broken.”</note>

                    <p>2044. Drumright at Sian in telegram October 27 reports as follows: Chungking
                        armies recently transferred to Shantung now being withdrawn by Chiang
                        Kai-shek’s orders. Only three divisions guerrillas remain north Yellow
                        River, regular troops having been removed from that area. Important northern
                        provinces thus almost entirely denuded of Chungking troops and only puppet,
                        Communist and Japanese forces remain. During October three Chungking armies
                        were moved to Shensi and Kansu from Honan as reinforcements on west flank of
                        Communist border region. Over one million Chungking troops now in Honan but
                        no indications of plans for North China offensive unless Japs completely
                        collapse. Military leaders in Sian area apparently devoting chief attention
                        to establishment closer relations with puppet forces who will at safe moment
                        support Chungking.</p>

                                pointedly what I thought of the China situation at this time. I
                                avoided any reference to the political and military situation by
                                saying that since my return from the United States I had been
                                particularly interested in bringing myself abreast of the general
                                position and had lately been studying the economic developments
                                which had taken place during my absence I continued that for the
                                past six or more years China has been facing a rapidly developing
                                economic situation which presented problems of great importance and
                                difficulty even for trained economic experts; I had been a keenly
                                interested observer of these developments and of the measures which
                                had been taken to endeavor to meet them.</p>
                            <p>The Generalissimo then undertook an exposition of his views on the
                                situation. He commented that the most important factor recently had
                                been the provision of the gold loan from the United States. It had
                                improved public confidence. He said that there are four important
                                factors in the economic situation: <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>Public confidence.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>Public administration.</item>
                                    <label>3.</label>

                                </list>
               </p>
                            <p>He regarded public confidence as of outstanding importance; and on
                                this heading, he considered that two important elements in restoring
                                or improving public confidence had been <list>
                                    <label>1.</label>
                                    <item>The making available of gold by the United States.</item>
                                    <label>2.</label>
                                    <item>The encouraging news of the progress of the war.</item>
                                </list>
               </p>
                            <p>He repeated again that the action of the United States in making the
                                “gold loan” available to China had been the most important factor
                                    <pb n="372" xml:id="pg_372" facs="0382"/>in restoring
                                confidence; and he wished that I would let this be known to
                                Secretary Morgenthau. He said that he also thought that if some
                                publicity could be given in the United States to the fact that gold
                                had been made available to China, the resulting publicity in China
                                would have a beneficial effect in further strengthening public
                                confidence. He said that the improvement in public confidence was
                                reflected in a greater stabilization of the prices of necessities
                                which had recently been noted. (Note: At a recent press conference
                                the Government spokesman told foreign correspondents that there has
                                been a stabilization in the price of rice, cotton yarn and cotton
                                cloth, and even a slight decrease—very slight indeed, but
                                nevertheless a decrease—in the price of coal. CEG).</p>
                        <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The End of the War</hi>. In response to my
                                comment that I hoped that this improvement in the situation would
                                continue, the Generalissimo said that he thought it would and that
                                the end of the war is in sight. He said that he thought another year
                                would see the principal battles fought and won; then perhaps it
                                might take a little time to mop up and complete the picture.</p>
                            <p>The balance of the conversation was more personal—my health, the new
                                Embassy quarters on the north bank, et cetera.<note n="82" xml:id="d297fn82">The Counselor of Embassy also had a
                                    conversation with Generalissimo Chiang, who expressed interest

                        strength of the Chinese Communist forces.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. According to civil and military sources
                            at Sian, the regular military forces of the Chinese Communists,
                            incorporated in the 18th Group Army under General Chu Teh, total about
                            200,000 men. They are said to be well trained, well led, well
                            disciplined, experienced and hardy and with good fighting spirit. There
                            is little or no illiteracy among them. About 30,000 of these troops are
                            stationed in the Shensi–Kansu–Ninghsia Border Region under Generals Lin
                            Piao and Ho Lung while the remainder are scattered through Hopei,
                            Chahar, Shantung, north Honan, Anliui and north Kiangsu. Guerrilla units
                            numbering about 300,000 engage in activities within or near Japanese
                            occupied areas but their training, leadership and equipment is inferior
                                <pb n="373" xml:id="pg_373" facs="0383"/>to that of the regular
                            troops. Local militia units, with practically no real military training
                            or equipment, are found throughout north China.</p>
                        <p>Military equipment is old and worn and not uniform and has been generally
                            acquired from the Japanese or National Government forces. The Communists
                            are estimated to have more than 200,000 rifles of various kinds and a
                            few thousand machine guns but very little artillery or ammunition for
                            such guns and no tanks or airplanes. They are able to manufacture a few
                            rifles, machine guns, hand grenades and ammunition.</p>
                        <p>In spite of their weakness in matériel, the Communists have managed to
                            maintain their footholds in north China where the mountainous terrain,
                            with practically no modern means of communications, gives them great
                            advantages. Military officials at Sian tend to make light of Communist
                            military strength and apparently believe that the Central Government
                            could easily and quickly liquidate the Communist forces in the north
                            Shensi area. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary.</hi>

                    <p>Chinese Communist sources at Chungking assert an “official figure” of 500,000
                        Communist regulars divided between the 18th Group Army and the new Fourth
                        Army, the latter commanded by General Chen I with headquarters in north

                        describe Communist equipment as consisting of rifles, light machine guns,
                        mortars and hand grenades. The partisans are said to be equipped chiefly
                        with spears and knives.</p>
                    <p>Chinese Communists at Chungking seem reluctant to give definitive figures for
                        their armed strength and state that the totals given are the “official
                        figures”. It is believed, therefore, that the actual military strength of
                        the Communist forces lies somewhere between the figures obtained by Mr.
                        Drumright from Central Government sources in Sian and those alleged by the
                        Communists at Chungking.</p>

                        on General Hsueh Yueh, the chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, and
                        of various phases of his military and civil administration. The information
                        and statements contained in this report are based entirely on <pb n="374" xml:id="pg_374" facs="0384"/>personal conversations with a variety of

                        missionaries, and Chinese smugglers during the writer’s recent brief visit
                        to Changsha.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> During the five-year term of office of
                            General Hsueh Yueh as Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, he
                            has shown little military or administrative ability. He has made little
                            effort to impede the three relatively peaceful Japanese occupations of
                            Changsha, and for the past year-and-a-half his troops seem to have
                            maintained some sort of an understanding with the Japanese to live in
                            peace with one another. There is a free exchange of rice from Hunan for
                            salt from Hankow, and a substantial trade in raw materials from Hunan to
                            Hankow in exchange for manufactured articles from Hankow, Shanghai and
                            other centers under Japanese control is being carried on. Considerable
                            friction exists between the Hunanese and the to them alien Cantonese
                            administration foisted on them by General Hsueh Yueh whose chief
                            advisers and subordinates are mainly from his native province of
                            Kwangtung. There is a marked tendency to place all industrial
                            enterprises under Government control much to the resentment of the
                            individual Hunanese businessman. American citizens generally have
                            received reasonable cooperation from local Chinese officials, and the
                            fine work of the American air force in Hunan is on the whole
                            appreciated. However, there is a strong anti-British sentiment prevalent
                            throughout the administration. Soviet Russian advisers continue to train
                            troops of the Ninth War Area Command.</p>

                    <p>As far as this Consulate is aware, Hunan is the only province in
                        Kuomintang-dominated China in which Soviet Russian advisers are still
                        engaged. There is an undetermined number of Russian military advisers
                        stationed to the north of Changsha. They hold themselves completely aloof
                        from other foreigners, and converse with Chinese only through interpreters.
                        There is a report which this office has been unable to confirm that
                        Soviet-trained Chinese artillerymen were largely responsible for the
                        discomfiture of the Japanese during their retirement from the Enshih area
                        last summer.</p>

                            adoption of a policy of resistance to Japan. However, General Chang
                            Hsueh-liang, who engineered the Incident, was courtmartialled and
                            subsequently placed under the control of the Military Council. He is now
                            being detained in a village near Kweiyang where he is leading a quiet
                            and studious life. The Young Marshal’s friends are doing everything in
                            their power to have him released. They feel that he enjoys a popularity
                            in China second only to the Generalissimo and that a man of his
                            abilities should be allowed to organize resistance in the northeast
                            where his followers are awaiting a signal from him. Because of its vast
                            resources, its advanced state of industrial development, and its
                            important geographical location between Russia, Japan and China,
                            Manchuria will inevitably play an important part in the future of the
                            Far East. There are four candidates for the role of administrator of
                            this territory: (1) Administrators appointed by Chungking, (2) The
                            revolutionary army now in Manchuria, (3) The Communist forces now in
                            North China, and (4) General Chang Hsueh-liang. According to the Young
                            Marshal’s supporters, his return to Manchuria would be the only logical
                            and fair solution. As a Manchurian, he would be welcomed by his people
                            who remain loyal to him, and who feel they have cause to be suspicious
                            of the motives of the administration in Chungking. The Communists and
                            the Soviet Government would be more inclined to trust him than they
                            would representatives appointed by Chungking. The revolutionary army
                            could be readily won over to his leadership. Finally, he and his
                            followers are committed to policies and principles which are in keeping
                            with those of the United Nations.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>It will be recalled that, on December 12, 1936, the Young Marshal engineered
                        the now famous Sian Incident, whereby he placed under detention
                        Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the time of the latter’s visit to Sian; and
                        that the Generalissimo was released only after having promised to (1) reject
                        his policy of fratricidal and fruitless warfare against the Communists for
                        one of active military resistance <pb n="376" xml:id="pg_376" facs="0386"/>against Japanese aggression, (2) institute a democratic form of
                        government, and (3) release political prisoners.</p>
                    <p>[Here follows detailed report based on views of Chang’s adherents.]</p>
                    <p>There is a wide-spread belief that the Chinese Communist Party and troops
                        intend to enter Manchuria whenever an opportunity presents itself, and the
                        Soviet Government would doubtless welcome and support them. Such a
                        development would, however, meet with strong opposition from the Manchurian
                        people, and there would doubtless be a recurrence of civil war. If the
                        Chinese Communists were to obtain the ascendency in Manchuria they would be
                        able to establish a strong liaison with Soviet Russia, and the Communist
                        problem in China would prove even more difficult of solution than it is at
                        present. Any effort on the part of the Central Government forcibly to remove
                        the Communist elements from Manchuria would be foredoomed to failure and
                        might invite Japanese intervention or even open hostilities between China
                        and Russia.</p>
                    <p>If the Young Marshal and his followers were authorized to take over control
                        of Manchuria, the situation would be entirely different. He would be
                        welcomed by the Manchurian people and he would have little difficulty in
                        obtaining the allegiance of the revolutionary army in Manchuria. A genuine
                        Manchurian administration would be far less inclined to create friction with
                        Soviet Russia than one controlled by the subordinates of Chiang Kai-shek.
                        The New Force is committed to international cooperation externally and
                        popular welfare and freedom internally. These policies would not only
                        satisfy the demands of the Manchurian people after their liberation, but
                        would also be in keeping with the express convictions of the United
                        Nations.</p>

                        proceed to Shantung. Chungking authorities are reportedly seriously
                        concerned over spread of Communist control in North China (our 1722, <pb n="377" xml:id="pg_377" facs="0387"/>September 15). Communists at
                        Chungking charge Central Government with encouraging defections of Chungking
                        troops to Japs with view to solving supply problem and to ensuring presence
                        of puppet troops friendly to Chungking who would provide opposition to
                        Communists now and at time of Jap withdrawal from North China. This
                        circumstance may also partially explain withdrawals and failure to send

                            Nations’ strategy prevents the realization of Kuomintang aims to have
                            Soviet Russia weakened through a Japanese attack or through American and
                            British transfer of their full strength to the Pacific, leaving Russia
                            to fight alone, the Kuomintang has three possible courses of action: (1)
                            to surrender to the Japanese; (2) to delay the fundamental solution of
                            the Communist problem while preparing for civil war; and (3) to alter
                            its political direction. The first course is advocated by defeatists who
                            wish to surrender to Japan and initiate civil war; thinking the
                            Kuomintang armies can easily defeat the Communists. The second course is
                            that favored by those who camouflage their real intentions of destroying
                            the Communists by emphasizing the C.E.C. and P.P.C. resolutions on
                            constitutional government and the solution of the Communist problem by
                            political means. The third course is favored by some Kuomintang members,
                            by the Communist Party and by all the people, for it means a just
                            solution of the Communist problem, the abolition of the fascist
                            dictatorship and the establishment of a democratic form of government.
                            Demands are presented to “Mr. Chiang” for continued resistance to
                            Japanese aggression, the cessation of the civil war crisis and the
                            anti-Communist movement, the withdrawal of the Chungking troops now
                            blockading the Communist areas, the abolition of one party dictatorship
                            and the secret service organs, the calling of the national congress

                    <p>This editorial is believed to represent the “official” views of the Chinese
                        Communist Party and its tone is a continuation of the critical and
                        unyielding attitude of most of the articles written by Communist Party
                        members during recent months which have been received by the Embassy. One
                        Chinese Communist stated recently that an agreement had been reached between
                        the Communists and Dr. Wang Shih-chieh, acting for the Kuomintang, for a
                        cessation of the bitter propaganda campaign which has been conducted by the

                        months (Embassy’s despatch no. 1651 of October 6, 1943). While there has not
                        yet been any direct evidence of such an agreement, there has been a
                        cessation of articles in the local Government-controlled press enumerating
                        the “Communist crimes,” a large number of which appeared in September.<note n="92" xml:id="d303fn92">Augustus S. Chase of the Division of Far

                    <p>The statement in regard to the Communist problem made by the newly appointed
                        Minister of Information, Liang Han-tsao, at his first press conference
                        (Embassy’s telegram no. 1995, October 21) was not published in the
                        vernacular press although it was carried by the Central News Agency English
                        Service. When questioned at a later press conference as to the reason for
                        the failure of the Chinese press to publish the statement (all other
                        statements made by the Minister at this press conference were published in
                        the Chinese press), the Minister said that it was unnecessary to publish
                        such a statement for Chinese consumption as informed Chinese are fully aware
                        of the true situation in regard to the Communist problem. The Foreign Office
                        spokesman at this conference added that it was necessary to let foreign
                        countries know the real situation. Apparently the Kuomintang is endeavoring
                        to play down the possibilities of civil war and the seriousness of the
                        situation in order to reassure foreign observers, and a cessation of the
                        propaganda campaign would be consistent with that policy.</p>

                        National Military Council, in arranging for an understanding between various
                        military commanders in southeast China and with a similar group in the

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Mr. Ringwalt states that according to
                            reliable information Marshal Li is unobtrusively working to arrange for
                            an understanding between various military commanders in south China for
                            a plan of concerted action in the event of a collapse of Chungking
                            authority either from internal or external causes. He is said to have
                            reached an informal agreement with a group which includes General Yu
                            Han-mou, General Chang Fa-kuei and General Hsueh Yueh, Commanders of the
                            7th, 4th and 9th War Zones, respectively, and to be negotiating with a
                            similar group in the southwest under the sponsorship of General Lung
                            Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, who has brought into
                            line a number of the Szechuan militarists. Mr. Ringwalt adds that the
                            negotiations are in no sense a separatist movement but are designed to
                            ensure unity in south and west China and continued resistance to Japan
                            if Chungking authority should collapse. The negotiations are proceeding,
                            so far as is possible, without the knowledge of the Central Government
                            which would be expected to oppose such action if it dared. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary</hi>.</p>

                    <p>It is believed that the above-described activities are of a pattern with the
                        activities of puppet representatives, such as those described in the
                        Embassy’s despatch No. 1682 of October 15.<note n="94" xml:id="d305fn94">Not
                            printed.</note> The various factions in China, including the puppets,
                        are looking to their post-war position. While these negotiations reportedly
                        being conducted by Marshal Li may not point to a separatist movement as long
                        as the Chungking Government maintains its authority, the southeastern and
                        southwestern military leaders are sufficiently astute to realize that there
                        are still “unreconstructed” elements on the Chinese scene and that a
                        Kuomintang attempt to force a military solution of the Communist problem
                        after the war may bring about new alignments and possibilities for which
                        they must make advance preparation. It is difficult to believe that the
                        negotiations have as their aim the assurance of unity in the south and in
                        the west merely in order to ensure continued resistance to the Japanese,
                        especially in view of the inclusion in the group of such figures as General
                        Yu Han-mou, General Lung Yun and the Szechuan militarists, none of whom has
                        made any notable contribution toward the defeat of Japan. General Yu’s
                        defense of Canton against Japanese attack was completely ineffectual and
                        General Lung and the Szechuan generals have given to the Central Government
                        in the war against Japan only such assistance and cooperation as was
                        absolutely necessary and unavoidable.</p>
                    <p>Marshal Li has a record of opposition to the Kuomintang, having been relieved
                        of his posts in 1928 and detained in Nanking during 1928–29 because of his
                        connection with the revolt of the Kwangsi faction against the Nationalist
                        Government. After being pardoned in 1931, he was again relieved of his posts
                        and expelled from the Kuomintang following his implication in the Fukien
                        independence movement in 1933–34. In 1938, however, after the outbreak of
                        Sino-Japanese hostilities, he was made a member of the National Military
                        Council and in 1941 was appointed head of the Generalissimo’s Headquarters
                        at Kweilin for the five provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi, Kwangtung, Kwangsi and
                        Hunan. Marshal Li is said by informed observers to have very little actual
                        power in Kwangsi (which is believed to be largely under the control of
                        General Li Tsung-jen) or in the other provinces under his headquarters but
                        to have considerable prestige in China through his reputation for honesty
                        and patriotism. Among the officers who served under Marshal Li when he was
                        Chief of Staff of the First Kwangtung Army in 1921 are numbered such
                        prominent figures as Generals Tsai Ting-kai, Chen Cheng, Yu Han-mou, Hsueh
                        Yueh and Chang Fa-kuei. One of General Li Tsung-jen’s close associates is
                        reported to have said that if anything happened to the Generalissimo his
                        place would be taken by Marshal Li and General Chen <pb n="382" xml:id="pg_382" facs="0392"/>Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese
                        Expeditionary Army—Li because of his standing and prestige and lack of undue
                        ambition and Chen because of his position as the outstanding “coming”
                        military figure in China.</p>
                    <p>It is not believed that these reported negotiations have any serious
                        implications at present but, if the report is accurate, they would indicate
                        that doubt exists in some quarters in regard to the continued stability and
                        authority of the Central Government in the long-range future.</p>

                            associated with the problem of Kuomintang-Communist relations and can be
                            interpreted as strong evidence that the Central Government does not
                            intend to rely upon “political means” alone as a solution of this
                            problem.</p>
                        <p>Information regarding the Chinese Communist forces is, therefore, of
                            importance. These forces are divided into three categories: regular
                            military forces, guerrilla forces and local militia. Regular military
                            forces consist of the 18th Group Army under General Chu Teh and the New
                            Fourth Army under General Chen Yi, together with two independent groups,
                            one in Kwangtung and the other on Hainan Island. Although the 18th Group
                            Army is supposed to be composed of three divisions numbering about
                            30,000 men, it is reported actually to number 320,000. Its headquarters
                            are at Yenan, the capital of the Shensi–Kansu–Ninghsia Border Region,
                            the most important of the twelve “regions” north of the Lunghai Railway
                            garrisoned by the 18th Group Army in north China. The New Fourth Army,
                            which ceased officially to exist after its disbandment by the Central
                            Government in 1941, is said to have a strength of 120,000 men in seven
                            divisions and to be better equipped than the 18th Group Army due to its
                            greater activity against the Japanese and the puppets and the consequent
                            capture of matériel from those sources. The New Fourth Army has its
                            headquarters at Yiencheng, Kiangsu, and operates in central and eastern
                                <pb n="383" xml:id="pg_383" facs="0393"/>China south of the Lunghai
                            Railway. The Chinese Communists claim to have a navy composed of
                            hundreds of sampans and junks along the Kiangsu coast serving in
                            transportation of supplies. Communists claim a total guerrilla force of
                            1,000,000 men but it is not believed that the figure exceeds 400,000.
                            Local militia units, said by the Communists to number 1,000,000 men, are
                            estimated at approximately 600,000.</p>
                        <p>As a composite military force the Chinese Communists are not capable of
                            much, if any, offensive action as their regular units, while well
                            trained and well led, are very poorly armed. The principal arm is the
                            rifle, supplemented by some few automatic rifles, some machine guns, not
                            much artillery (and still less ammunition), no tanks, no planes and a
                            small number of almost worn out trucks. Their strength lies in guerrilla
                            activity.</p>
                        <p>The present dispositions of the Communist forces, together with their
                            considerable training and leadership, would enable them very easily to
                            move into the north China areas if the Japanese should withdraw, and the
                            movement of Central Government troops toward the Communist areas may be
                            intended to prevent such action. In the event of actual hostilities the
                            Communists could probably muster no more than 600,000 men, a force which
                            would, however, require at least 1,000,000 Central Government troops to
                            oppose them. At present the numerical ratio between the Communists and
                            the Central Government, taking all factors into consideration, can
                            reasonably be placed at 1 to 1, but with the continued receipt of
                            further equipment from China’s allies the Central Government’s
                            superiority will be vastly increased. At present the problem of
                            Kuomintang-Communist relations is a very serious one which approaches a
                            showdown as the war goes on and the reported Chungking troop
                            concentrations in the Northwest make the situation ominous. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary</hi>.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>Another factor in the Kuomintang-Communist situation which cannot be ignored
                        in the event of a civil war is the possible support the Communists might
                        receive from elements other than those in the present Communist-occupied
                        areas. Potential strength lies in the conditions of the peasants, who
                        comprise about 80 percent of the population. Opposition on the part of the
                        peasants to conscription methods, enforced labor, military requisitions,
                        heavy taxation in kind and official corruption is widespread and during the
                        past year has taken the form of armed revolt in several provinces. Peasants
                        are unorganized, lack leaders and are not politically’ conscious, but if the
                        internal administration should become chaotic or if the Kuomintang should
                        attack the Communists, the latter will not only be in a position to
                        capitalize on this agrarian discontent but will be certain to endeavor to
                        spread the movement. Central Government measures for dealing with these
                        local revolts have done little more than increase the hostility of the
                        peasants toward the Central Government and have not achieved a fundamental
                        solution of the problem by removing the causes of complaint. It may be said
                        that the economic condition of the country and <pb n="384" xml:id="pg_384" facs="0394"/>the widespread agrarian discontent create fertile ground
                        for Communist propaganda and that strong opposition to civil war is believed
                        to be entertained by almost all Chinese, excepting the more rabid Kuomintang
                        members. These factors do not indicate that a Kuomintang attempt to solve
                        the Communist problem by military force at present would be the easy task
                        envisaged by some of the more rabid anti-Communist elements in the
                        Kuomintang. It is, therefore, disquieting that the Kuomintang should on the
                        one hand announce a “political solution” of the Communist problem (Embassy’s
                        despatch No. 1675 of October 14) and form a committee for the establishment
                        of constitutional goverment after the war (which, as reported in our
                        despatch no. 1747, October 28, is criticized by the minority parties as
                        being, like the People’s Political Council, a Kuomintang dominated organ)
                        and on the other hand continue the movement of additional troops to the
                        Communist areas in the Northwest.<note n="97" xml:id="d306fn97">Augustus S.

                            the Acquisition of Foreign Publications.</note> representative at
                        Chungking, entitled “The Intellectual Leadership of the Minister of

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The student movement and the intellectual
                            enthusiasm which existed during the early days of the Sino-Japanese
                            conflict have not only deteriorated but have been actively suppressed.
                            This suppression has apparently arisen from the Kuomintang’s desire to
                            ensure a continuation of its power; and intellectual stultification has
                            been promoted largely by Chen Li-f u, the Minister of Education and a
                            leader of the reactionary CC clique. Kuomintang leaders clearly hold
                            pernicious and antiquated views in regard to the process of intellectual
                            adjustment to the modern world which China must sooner or later make.
                            Examples of these views are shown in writings of Chen Li-fu which call
                            for the revival of Confucianism as the only means <pb n="385" xml:id="pg_385" facs="0395"/>by which the Chinese race can be
                            revived and state that world peace can be achieved only by the
                            reformation of thought through ancient Chinese culture. Other instances
                            of such views are contained in an editorial in the <hi rend="italic">National Herald</hi> in which it is stated that the Chinese have
                            developed a basic outlook on life which is a truer one than the
                            pseudo-scientific outlooks which have plagued the western world. Dr.
                            Fairbank observes that these ideas and evaluations are both a source of
                            and a vehicle for atavism, chauvinism and xenophobia and that it is in
                            the American interest that the Department’s cultural relations program
                            lend all legitimate support to the truth as opposed to these ideas. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>

                        Ringwalt, Consul at Kweilin temporarily detailed to Kunming, regarding
                        criticism of the Central Government by Marshal Li during a mass meeting in
                        celebration of the Soviet National Holiday at Kweilin.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. In the memorandum Mr. Ringwalt states
                            that the mass meeting at Kweilin on the occasion of the Soviet National
                            Holiday, attended by over 1,500 people, was quite spontaneous and
                            without official support. Marshal Li addressing the meeting informally
                            compared the progress made during the Soviet revolution and that during
                            the Chinese revolution and ascribed China’s relative backwardness to
                            corruption, incompetence and defeatism and, by implication, to its lack
                            of leaders of ability, character and determination. It is pointed out in
                            the despatch that the mass meeting is an indication of the extent of
                            popular Chinese admiration of the Soviet Government and that the
                            criticism offered by Marshal Li represents outspoken criticism of the
                            administration by the ranking Central Government official in south
                            China. This criticism was repeated to Mr. Ringwalt by Marshal Li. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary.</hi>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The Committee for the Establishment of
                            Constitutional Government was formally inaugurated on November 12 under
                            the chairmanship of President Chiang Kai-shek who, in an address to the
                            Committee, described its functions as consisting chiefly of making
                            recommendations, investigations and examinations aimed at enabling the
                            Government to carry out “constitutionalism.” The Standing Committee at
                            its first meeting adopted by-laws providing for creation of
                            sub-committees for the study of the draft constitution, of matters
                            relating to organs of public opinion and of the enforcement of all laws
                            relating to constitutional government. Government spokesmen and the
                            Party Ministry of Information continued to emphasize the preparations
                            being made by the Kuomintang for constitutional government after the
                            war. Only a few minority party members attended the inaugural meeting of
                            the Committee. It is generally believed that minority party
                            participation in the work of the Committee will not be active, the
                            request of the minority parties for the appointment of certain of their
                            leaders having been refused and the hopes for any real opposition to
                            Kuomintang domination of the Committee having apparently been abandoned.

                    <p>2370. Since the return of T. V. Soong early in October there have been
                        persistent reports from varied sources that serious difficulties have arisen
                        between him and the Generalissimo and that there has been in progress a
                        violent family row … The general tenor of the reports is that Soong incurred
                        Chiang’s anger by making decisions in Washington without prior reference to
                        the Generalissimo (the giving of China’s agreement to the Italian Armistice
                        terms is reportedly one instance); that while at Delhi en route he repeated
                        this error in agreeing to some jurisdictional proposals of Mountbatten<note n="2" xml:id="d311fn2">Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied
                            Commander, Southeast Asia.</note> which are said to be still at issue;
                        that, during his first talk with the Generalissimo, Soong made the breach
                        irreparable by losing his own temper in the face of Chiang’s violent
                        dressing down; that some Chinese returning from the United States poisoned
                        Chiang’s mind against Soong with stories of the latter’s alleged personal
                        financial transactions …</p>
                    <p>It has been obvious from Soong’s actions that there has been something
                        radically wrong. Upon his return to Chungking, he immediately went almost
                        into retirement socially and officially, transacting only necessary business
                        with foreign diplomatic representatives at his residence and repairing
                        frequently to the hills. Unusual delays were (and still are) encountered in
                        matters requiring his attention and matters which would ordinarily receive
                        ready reply (such as question of adherence of Colombia to United Nations
                        Declaration) have had to wait “decision by the Generalissimo”. It was
                        reliably reported that Soong was rudely shut out of the room when Chiang
                        conferred with Mountbatten and he did not accompany the Chiangs to
                        Cairo.</p>
                    <p>About a month ago it was widely reported that the difficulties had been
                        smoothed out but recent stories from a number of sources indicate <pb n="388" xml:id="pg_388" facs="0398"/>that the situation has not improved
                        and Soong is obviously not his usual self. That the hostility between him
                        and Kung has never been resolved is doubtless an additional disruptive
                        factor in the situation.</p>

                    <p>2195. During the course of a conversation on December 10 with Liu, Counselor
                        of the Chinese Embassy here, Liu told Hamilton<note n="3" xml:id="d312fn3">Maxwell M. Hamilton, Counselor of Embassy in the Soviet Union.</note>
                        that there had been no recent developments in relations between the Chinese
                        Government and the Chinese Communists. Liu stated definitely that there was
                        no air communication between the Chinese Communists and the Soviet Union;
                        that if Soviet planes flew into Yenan the Chinese Government would certainly
                        know it; that several times a year Soviet planes in addition to planes
                        operated to Hami on the regular route made flights into Chinese territory
                        but in such cases by advance arrangement with the Chinese Government.

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of despatch
                        No. 50, October 23, 1943, from the Consul at Tihwa, with which is
                        transmitted a translation of an article<note n="5" xml:id="d313fn5">Neither
                            printed.</note> entitled “A Survey of Future Sino-Soviet Relations” by
                        Mr. Chaucer H. Wu, Special Delegate for Foreign Affairs at Tihwa, which
                        appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Sinkiang Jih Pao</hi> of October 10, 1943.
                        In this article Mr. Wu emphasizes China’s and Russia’s joint responsibility
                        for the “surveillance” of Japan and maintenance <pb n="389" xml:id="pg_389" facs="0399"/>of peace in the Far East, the long common boundary between
                        China and Russia, and the strong economic ties between the two countries. He
                        closes with a plea for the “development of still more intimate friendship”
                        between the two countries.</p>
                    <p>In his transmitting despatch Mr. Clubb states that it is to be expected that
                        the Chinese will attempt, especially if the Burma road is not soon reopened,
                        to repair the damage previously done to Sino-Soviet relationships through
                        Chinese ineptness with a view to (1) obtaining actual material aid and (2)
                        stimulating other United Nations to increase their aid to China in the
                        assumed fear that Soviet Russian influence might gain an ascendency in
                        China. Mr. Clubb also states that Special Delegate Wu informed him (1) that
                        he intends to endeavor to resuscitate the Tihwa Sino-Soviet Cultural
                        Association and (2) that China was informed by Mr. Molotov about a year and
                        a half ago that as soon as the Japanese threat to Outer Mongolia had passed
                        and China had improved its policy of dealing with the Mongols, the Soviet
                        Union would offer no objection to the reassertion of Chinese sovereignty
                        over Outer Mongolia.</p>
                    <p>Although the Embassy considers Mr. Clubb’s views reasonable, there has as yet
                        not been noted in Chungking any substantial evidence of an effort to improve
                        Sino-Soviet relations.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. The Special Delegate for Foreign Affairs,
                            Mr. Chaucer H. Wu, informed Mr. Clubb in October that reported Kazak
                            uprisings in the Altai region (Embassy’s telegram 1982, October 20, 9
                            a.m.) involved some 5,000 rebels, but on December 10 he stated that
                            there were only some 400 originally involved of whom there then remained
                            approximately 100 to be rounded up. On October 16 Mr. Wu stated that he
                            had been having “much trouble” with incidents on the Soviet border
                            involving Russian “ronin”. On December 10 Mr. Wu informed Mr. Clubb in
                            confidence that the Soviets had concentrated an important military force
                            on the border near the pass leading <pb n="390" xml:id="pg_390" facs="0400"/>to Kashgar, but he admitted at the same time that the
                            previously reported Kirghiz unrest in the Kashgar area had died down.
                            Early in December relations between Mr. Wu’s office and the Soviet
                            Consulate General were reported to be strained over negotiations in
                            regard to the arrest by local authorities of certain persons which the
                            Soviet authorities asserted to be Soviet citizens. On December 3
                            Provincial Chairman Sheng Shih-ts’ai informed Mr. Clubb that present
                            plans do not call for establishment of heavy industry in Sinkiang
                            because of the province’s proximity to the Soviet Union. Some Chinese in
                            Sinkiang appear to believe that after the present war China will be
                            forced to fight Soviet Russia in order to regain control of Outer
                            Mongolia. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary</hi>.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>A reading of the enclosed despatches leaves the impression that there is
                        rather widespread apprehension in Sinkiang over the future of Sino-Soviet
                        relations, a feeling which has also been reported in the Lanchow area
                        (Embassy’s despatch No. 1807, November 12, 1943)<note n="8" xml:id="d314fn8">Not printed.</note> and which was recently expressed in rather vague
                        terms by General Yang Chieh, former Chinese Ambassador to Russia, in
                        conversation with an officer of the Embassy.</p>
                    <p>Special Delegate Wu, while avoiding direct accusations, appears to have done
                        his best to suggest to Mr. Clubb that the Soviets are engaged in various
                        activities designed to keep their relations with Sinkiang strained and to
                        throw that province into a new political turmoil. Mr. Clubb states that he
                        views Mr. Wu’s reports on this subject with extreme reserve.</p>

                        of November 27, 1943, in regard to the activities of Marshal Li Chi-shen,
                        head of the Kweilin office of the Military Affairs Commission, I have the
                        honor to enclose a copy of airgram no. A–23, December 2, 6 p.m., from the
                        Consulate at Kweilin<note n="8" xml:id="d315fn8">Not printed.</note>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Mr. Service states that it has been
                            reliably reported at Kweilin that Marshal Li has been offered a post at
                            Chungking by General Chiang Kai-shek but that it is believed that
                            Marshal Li has no intention of accepting such an appointment. He will
                            perhaps go <pb n="391" xml:id="pg_391" facs="0401"/>into “retirement” in
                            Kwangsi from which he can emerge in the event of a military crisis in
                            south China. It is also reported that the Kweilin office of the Military
                            Affairs Commission, of which Marshal Li is the head, will be reorganized
                            or abolished in the near future. Related to the question of the status
                            of this office are rumors that General Pax Chung-hsi, Deputy Chief of
                            Staff, is soon to be appointed to an important military post in south
                            China. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary</hi>.</p>

                    <p>While the Embassy has been unable to obtain at Chungking any confirmation of
                        the reported activities of Marshal Li looking toward an agreement between
                        certain Chinese military commanders in south and southwest China (Embassy’s
                        despatch no. 1829 of November 18), the above-mentioned reports of offers by
                        General Chiang to Marshal Li of a post at Chungking, of the abolishment of
                        the Kweilin office headed by Marshal Li (confirmed by the Military Attaché)
                        and of the appointment of General Pai to a post in south China may bear some
                        connection with those reported activities. Marshal Li is reliably reported
                        to have refused on numerous occasions to carry out Chungking orders to
                        arrest Chinese liberals at Kweilin suspected of being critical of the
                        Kuomintang and his outspoken criticism of the Central Government during his
                        recent address at Kweilin (Embassy’s despatch under reference) cannot have
                        passed unnoticed by the Chungking leaders.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Mr. Ludden reports that preliminary
                            inquiries fail to reveal the existence of youth labor camps in Yunnan.
                            Informed sources, however, mention such camps in Enshih, Hupeh, under
                            the direction of the Kuomintang and in or near Taiho, Kiangsi.</p>
                        <pb n="392" xml:id="pg_392" facs="0402"/>
                        <p>Mr. Rice states that the inmates of the labor camp at Sian have at times
                            numbered 2,000 but that at present the total is between 700 and 800,
                            most of whom are young and about five per cent of whom are girls. The
                            inmates are said to include Y. M. C. A. secretaries and other Chinese
                            who are not actually radicals but are suspected of being liberals. He
                            states that there has been comparatively little student radicalism in
                            Chinghai, Ninghsia and Kansu Provinces and that in Ninghsia occasional
                            radical students are reportedly imprisoned or shot.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Service reports that according to reliable information “thought
                            correction” camps exist in at least nine provinces in Kuomintang China.
                            The camps are operated by agents trained by the Central Kuomintang
                            Headquarters and are nominally under the direction of Provincial Tangpu
                            (Party) organizations. Prisoners are questioned by intelligent and
                            well-trained interrogators and while torture is practised it is probable
                            that prisoners are held primarily in order to prevent their
                            communicating their suspected communist convictions to others. Food is
                            said to be poor, reading material is limited to Kuomintang publications
                            and visitors are seldom admitted. Those fortunate enough to be released
                            are threatened with death should they divulge information regarding
                            these camps. Interrogation of one reliable informant, recently an inmate
                            of one such camp, included exhaustive inquiries regarding his relations
                            with Americans and other foreigners. <hi rend="italic">End of
                                Summary</hi>.</p>
                    </quote>
                    <p>The Embassy has been reliably informed of the existence of two such camps in
                        the vicinity of Chungking (one near Chingmukuan, 70 li from the city and
                        perhaps the camp mentioned in the enclosed memorandum as being at
                        Hsinkaishih under the direction of the notorious General Tai Li, and the
                        other in the hills across the Yangtze River from Chungking under the
                        direction of the Chungking Garrison Headquarters). The inmates of both of
                        these camps are said to be held in caves which abound in this region and
                        those who may be released after one or two years of detention are reportedly
                        usually broken both in body and in mind. One reliable Chinese informant
                        states that a Chinese woman teacher in a middle school at Tzeliutsing,
                        Szechuan, who was arrested by the Party secret police and brought to the
                        headquarters of the Central Training Corps at Chungking for questioning,
                        became completely insane after two days of grilling. This allegedly innocent
                        victim was then returned to her home at Tzeliutsing without any explanation
                        being given to her family of the circumstances surrounding her arrest or
                        consequent insanity.</p>
                    <p>The power and influence of the secret police under General Tai Li and of the
                        Kuomintang secret police are such that youth of known radical inclinations
                        are perhaps more apt to be imprisoned or shot outright than to be sent to a
                        camp for “reformation.” Apparently those sent to the camps are for the most
                        part persons who are merely suspected of “incorrect thinking” and who may
                        thus be “cured” thereof as well as serve as an example to others who might
                        be inclined to such <pb n="393" xml:id="pg_393" facs="0403"/>beliefs. These
                        camps are evidently a refinement of the Kuomintang, as the Consul at Tihwa
                        states that so far as he is aware such camps do not exist in Sinkiang and
                        that imprisonment is the punishment widely given to those guilty of
                        unorthodox thinking in that province. Additional indications of the
                        Kuomintang inspiration behind these camps is seen in the reported lack of
                        such camps in those provinces where Kuomintang power is least, such as
                        Yunnan, Sikang, Chinghai, Ninghsia, Suiyuan and Kansu.</p>
                    <p>As Mr. Service’s despatch on this subject named in several places the source
                        of his information, the Embassy has prepared the enclosed memorandum based
                        on his despatch and omitting any reference which might indicate the identity
                        of the informant. Mr. Service and the Consulate General at Kunming are being
                        instructed to destroy their copies of Kweilin’s despatch, as is being done
                        by the Embassy. The Embassy believes that Mr. Service should be commended
                        for his initiative in obtaining such detailed information in regard to the
                        existence of labor camps in China and for the preparation of the despatch
                        reporting that information, which is of considerable interest as depicting a
                        phase of the scene in China about which little has heretofore been
                        known.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>: Police Chief Li Ying-ch’i and Defense
                                Commissioner Sheng Shih-ts’ai are in agreement in their
                                pre-Kuomintang-era assertions that the U.S.S.R. had no aggressive
                                designs regarding Sinkiang but contrariwise had extended spiritual
                                and material aid to the province. It appears to be a fact that
                                Sinkiang derived benefit from trade with the U.S.S.R., and from the
                                despatch of Soviet technicians and advisers, the extension of
                                credits, and the occasional granting of military assistance, at a
                                time when all were needed. General Sheng, by the evidence,
                                established himself in power in Sinkiang largely independent from
                                the Kuomintang power at Nanking. In 1934, 1936 and 1937 Soviet
                                Russian military forces in the guise of <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> Russians assisted General Sheng in the suppression
                                of revolts against his rule; and in the year 1937, after both the
                                suppression of that year’s Uighur rebellion and the outbreak of the
                                Sino-Japanese War, Soviet troops went into garrison at Hami, still
                                in the same guise. The Chinese side has stated that the function of
                                the garrison was really to prevent Moslem General Ma Pu-fang’s from
                                linking up with Sinkiang Moslem forces, the Soviet side has stated
                                that its function was with relation to Sino-Japanese hostilities
                                (implication: a Soviet move of self-defense): each side may have had
                                its individual aim, with accord reached on the basis of some tacit
                                understanding reached as early as 1934—with the National Government
                                in the then circumstances perhaps even acquiescing in the
                                arrangement. Soviet Russian “intentions” vis-à-vis Sinkiang during
                                the period of General Sheng’s rule, viewed against the background of
                                world events and Soviet policies of the time, appear to have been in
                                fact non-aggressive as stated by the quoted Chinese leaders. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary</hi>.</p>

                            strict secrecy in regard to prison conditions in that province little
                            detailed information on the subject is available. It is known, however,
                            that of the 200 to 300 <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> Russian army
                            officers in Sinkiang in 1934 all but a handful are now in prison.
                            Large-scale arrests of <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> Russians took place
                            in 1934 and in 1938 and one well informed Russian <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> believes that easily one-half of the adult male <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> population of Sinkiang is now in prison
                            (perhaps as many as 3,500 persons out of the total <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> population of approximately 14,000). One informed
                            Chinese estimated that 20,000 persons were arrested in the 1937–38
                            period alone. In addition to <hi rend="italic">émigré</hi> Russians,
                            many Chinese (even youths of high-school age), members of the Turki,
                            Kazak and other Sinkiang racial groups, members of scientific
                            expeditions, and even British and other European missionaries have
                            served terms in Sinkiang prisons. Prison conditions are described as
                            “medieval” and torture, solitary confinement in rooms without light, et
                            cetera, are common practices. Persons are sentenced to prison by
                            “special courts” sitting <hi rend="italic">in camera</hi> and once
                            confined are rarely released. The most important prison center in
                            Sinkiang is Tihwa, where there are said to be between 10 and 15 prisons.

                            <p>Famine conditions in Honan remain approximately as described in my
                                telegram of October 27. There is widespread privation but little
                                actual starvation at present. The most difficult period, however,
                                will be from March until the wheat is harvested in late May. The
                                majority of the refugees come from the flooded region in vicinity of
                                Chengchow and from the area north of the Yellow River where the
                                shortage of food is acute and prices are higher. The authorities are
                                apparently doing little relief work at present; foreign relief
                                organizations are doing excellent work but their efforts are limited
                                by scarcity of funds. After trip through Honan it seems clear that
                                the burden of taxation, various official exactions and
                                transportation difficulties have figured largely in the

                            residents of northeast Kansu and Ninghsia additional clashes have
                            occured recently between Central Government and Communist forces, the

                            that the Ninghsia forces are attempting to establish direct contact with
                            the troops under General Teng Pao-shan at Yulin, north Shensi, which are
                            at present dependent upon the Communist area for supplies. Most of the

                    <p>There has apparently been no marked change in the situation affecting
                        Kuomintang-Communist relations. In line with the statement by Communist
                        representatives at Chungking that the propaganda campaign of the two parties
                        had by common agreement been abandoned (Embassy’s despatch under reference),
                        the Embassy has not during the past month received any of the publicity
                        material formerly issued by the local Communists. The sole reference to the
                        Communist question <pb n="397" xml:id="pg_397" facs="0407"/>by the Chungking
                        authorities was that made by the Kuomintang Minister of Information on
                        December 15 at a press conference when he stated that he had nothing to add
                        to his previous statement on the Communist problem (Embassy’s telegram no.
                        1995, October 21). The Minister described as an “enthusiastic welcome” the
                        reception given to General Teng Pao-shan at Yenan when he passed through the
                        Communist capital recently en route from Chungking to Yulin. He further
                        stated that General Teng “conveyed to the Communist Party and its leaders
                        the benevolent intentions of the National Government” as contained in
                        President Chiang Kai-shek’s statement on the Communist problem at the time
                        of the C.E.C. session in September (Embassy’s despatch no. 1675, October 14)
                        and cautioned them against being oversensitive. As has been the case with
                        other statements on the Communist question issued by the Kuomintang Ministry
                        of Information (Embassy’s despatch under reference), this account of General
                        Teng’s journey through Yenan was published only in the English language
                        press at Chungking and did not appear in the Chinese newspapers. Such items
                        are apparently intended for foreign rather than for Chinese consumption and
                        are believed to be part of a quiet campaign on the part of the Kuomintang to
                        build up a picture of Kuomintang conciliation and forbearance in regard to
                        the Communist problem.</p>
                    <p>One of the Communist representatives recently implied that the Communist
                        Party had now reached the point where it would make no further effort at
                        present to cooperate with the Kuomintang, convinced as it was that the
                        latter party had no intention of making any real effort to solve the
                        questions between them peacefully and feeling that it was now strong enough
                        to stand its ground against possible present Chungking attacks. The close
                        surveillance of the Chinese Communists at Chungking by the secret police
                        continues and this attention to Communist activities apparently includes a
                        careful watch over various other Chinese suspected either of having
                        Communist sympathies or of being critical of the Kuomintang.</p>

                            Laurence Salisbury. Vincent’s name, I recall, you knew. He is now with
                            FEA. Salisbury is a Japanese language officer, as Bohlen is Russian and
                            I Chinese. He has served in both Japan and China, investigated on
                            special orders from the State Department the Japanese occupation of
                            Manchuria and until a month or two before Pearl Harbor served as
                            political adviser to Sayre in Manila. He has since been Assistant Chief

                        <p>Japan’s attack caught China in mid-passage between semi-feudalism and
                            modern statehood. External pressure in the form of Japanese aggression
                            imposed a temporary unity on the various elements struggling to
                            determine whether China was to develop along democratic or authoritarian
                            lines. Public pressure compelled Chiang, who was the strongest of these
                            elements, to become the symbol of a unified national will. The internal
                            conflict was suspended.</p>
                        <p>This situation continued so long as the Japanese attempted to bring China
                            to its knees by military means. But after the fall of Hankow in 1938 the
                            war entered a period of military stagnation which has continued until
                            now. Japan adopted instead a shrewd policy of political and economic
                            offensives designed to bring about Chinese disintegration and collapse.
                            Confronted with this new Japanese tactic, which promised him some
                            respite at the expense of other Chinese elements, Chiang chose to
                            abandon Chinese unity and retrogressed to his pre-war position as a
                            Chinese militarist seeking to dominate rather than unify and lead.</p>
                        <p rend="center">. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
                        <p>Because his Kuomintang the centrifugal forces in China are growing under
                            prolonged economic <pb n="399" xml:id="pg_399" facs="0409"/>strain and
                            because the Soviet Union may join the war against Japan and enter
                            Manchuria and North China, the Generalissimo faces next year the gravest
                            crisis of his career.</p>
                        <p>What form and course the crisis will take is impossible to predict.
                            Certain contributory factors, however, are clear. One is the
                            increasingly independent attitude of the Chinese Communists, who now say
                            that they no longer fear Chungking. “If Chiang wants to commit suicide
                            on us, that suits us.” Another is the accelerating economic
                            disintegration. A third is the growing restiveness of certain provincial
                            and military factions. Any one or a combination of these may be
                            sufficient to accomplish Chiang’s downfall.</p>
                        <p>By reversing his policy of sixteen years’ standing, reforming the
                            Kuomintang and taking the lead in a genuine united front, Chiang could
                            surely survive the crisis. But the Generalissimo is not only personally
                            incapable of this, he is a hostage of the corrupt forces he
                            manipulates.</p>
                        <p>In this uncertain situation we should avoid committing ourselves’
                            unalterably to Chiang, We should be ready during or after the war to
                            adjust ourselves to possible realignments in China, We should wish, for
                            example, to avoid finding ourselves at the close of the war backing a
                            coalition of Chiang’s Kuomintang and the degenerate puppets against a
                            democratic coalition commanding Russian sympathy.</p>
                        <p>The adoption of a more realistic policy toward Chiang Kai-shek does not
                            mean abandonment of our objectives (1) to capitalize during the war on
                            China’s position on the Japanese flank, and (2) to build up after the
                            war a strong and independent China. On the contrary, it will mean that
                            we shall be more likely to achieve these objectives. A realistic policy
                            toward Chiang would be based on (1) recognition by us that the
                            Generalissimo is highly susceptible to firm coordinated American
                            pressure, (2) stern bargaining (in consultation with American
                            representatives in China) and (3) readiness to support a strong new
                            coalition offering cooperation mutually more beneficial to China and the
                            United States.</p>

                            <item>It is feeling here that in case of Chinese purchasers, China
                                continues to have ultimate jurisdiction and control over U. S.
                                dollar proceeds, but that this would not be true in the cases of
                                purchases by foreigners or foreign business houses. Treasury can
                                understand China’s reluctance to prevent export of bonds, etc., held
                                by Chinese. Treasury freezing controls, however, can be employed so
                                as to freeze all such bonds, etc., in hands of Chinese sending same
                                to the U. S. so that China may continue to control these assets.
                                This action would not require export restrictions by China. Does
                                China want Treasury to take such action?</item>

                                    certificates would be taken up and delivered to a Federal

                        <p>137. From Adler for Secretary of Treasury. TF–85. Re your 106, January
                            20.</p>
                        <p>1. In a conversation with Dr. Kung<note n="8" xml:id="d325fn8">Chinese Minister of Finance.</note> yesterday, I informed him
                                of the status of savings certificates, post dated checks and drafts
                                under existing regulations. He was most upset by the fact that the
                                United States dollar proceeds of certificates et cetera would have
                                to be paid into a blocked account on maturity if they are payable to
                                blocked nationals. He indicated that most of the purchasers of
                                certificates et cetera are blocked nationals who made their
                                purchases on the understanding that the United States dollar
                                proceeds would be free and that, if Chinese investors realized these
                                proceeds would be blocked, sales of certificates, which had picked
                                up encouragingly with the announcement that drafts or post dated
                                checks could be obtained in lieu of or in exchange for certificates,
                                would very sharply fall off. A situation would then arise in which
                                one of the purposes for which the American loan to China was made
                                and the certificates were issued—namely, as an anti-inflationary
                                measure to facilitate absorption of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>—would be defeated. He felt therefore that in this
                                connection the Treasury could best implement its desire to help
                                China by a modification of FFC<note n="9" xml:id="d325fn9">Foreign

                                        would be reluctant to consider any modification of existing
                                        regulations.</item>

                                <p>With respect to (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), Dr. Kung agreed; such
                                    was the psychology of Chinese investors, however, that they
                                    would shun certificates the United States dollar proceeds of
                                    which were blocked on maturity for fear that Chinese authorities
                                    might later play some trick on them, and it would then be
                                    impossible [for] Chinese Government to derive any immediate
                                    benefit from the American loan. The 1942 budget, he added, had
                                    been planned on assumption that the whole of the issue of
                                    certificates would be taken up by the public; since beginning of
                                    year, between United States dollars 6 and 7 million had been
                                    bought and prospects for selling the issue out were most
                                    favorable. But with discovery that United States dollar proceeds
                                    would be blocked investors would cease to buy the
                                    certificates.</p>
                                <p>With respect to (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), he was of course
                                    fully aware of the necessity for safeguards but felt that fact
                                    the government banks selling the certificates, et cetera, kept
                                    records of the identity of purchasers constituted a check; a
                                    reporting requirement in the United States for transactions with
                                    United States dollar proceeds could constitute an additional
                                    check.</p>
                            <p>3. It is most unfortunate that Chinese Government raised the question
                                of the status of certificates, et cetera, only when it was about to
                                adopt the plan of issuing drafts or post-dated checks in lieu of or
                                in exchange for certificates. However, speedy settlement of question
                                is now desirable. I am afraid that Dr. Kung’s point with respect to
                                the psychology of Chinese investing public is only too well taken
                                and that unless there is some modification of existing FFC
                                regulations in relation to status of certificates, et cetera, their
                                sales will be drastically curtailed and confidence in Chinese
                                finances seriously undermined. [Adler.]</p>

                            <item>In recent conversations Dr. Kung has repeated his opinion that a
                                reduction in official exchange rate and institution of special
                                exchange rates for USAF are both undesirable, though my impression
                                is that his attitude to a reduction in exchange rate is less adamant
                                than formerly. He told me a day or two ago that he was
                                sympathetically considering a plan for reverse Lend-Lease<note n="10" xml:id="d326fn10">For further correspondence on reverse
                                    Lend-Lease, see <ref target="#pg_515">pp. 515</ref> ff.</note>
                                for USAF which would take care of its expenses in China. (Another
                                feature of the scheme he is considering, I believe, is the granting
                                in a disguised form of special rates to American soldiers for their
                                personal expenses.) The Generalissimo has already approved the plan
                                provided it does not involve expenditures of over CN $10,000,000 per
                                month. But before submitting the plan to the Treasury formally Dr.
                                Kung wished to learn your attitude to reverse Lend-Lease by
                                China.</item>

                                in foreign currencies would be restricted to Central Bank or its

                                requested by the Ministry of Finance, to make available US $20
                                million from China’s credit on the books of the Treasury to meet
                                payments referred to above, but that the Treasury does not
                                understand why Dr. Kung is requesting an additional US $20 million
                                when the Government of China still has very substantial idle funds
                                in addition to the unearmarked portion of the US $500 million
                                credit. The Treasury would have to borrow the requested $20 million,
                                paying interest thereon, and, therefore, from a fiscal point of
                                view, the Treasury would prefer to have the Chinese use their idle
                                funds before drawing further on their credit with the Treasury. If,
                                in the future, the <pb n="408" xml:id="pg_408" facs="0418"/>Chinese
                                needed more funds, they could call on the Treasury for such, as long
                                as the $500 million credit had not been exhausted.</item>

                        <p>184. To Secretary of the Treasury from Adler. TF–89. In accordance with

                            April 1, 1941, Board asks me to consult you on the desirability of
                            investing the United States $2,000,000 in its account with the Federal
                            Reserve Bank in direct obligations of the Government of the United
                            States. The Board is receiving sufficient United States dollars from
                            remittances to meet its out-payments for the next few months with
                            respect to both direct applications for foreign exchange and to its
                            obligations to the Central Bank under the November 1 agreement without
                            having to draw on the United States $2,000,000 in the Federal Reserve
                            Bank. [Adler.]</p>

                            mentioned to you the other day. The memorandum appears without title or
                            initials because last February when people were scratching their heads
                            trying to dope out the most effective way of aiding Chinese internal
                            finances from the outside someone had the idea of submission of
                            anonymous suggestions.</p>
                        <p>The idea of using dollars to secure savings certificates and bonds
                            originated, as I recall, with the Chinese. Unfortunately when it came to
                            implementing the idea the Chinese characteristically barged <pb n="409" xml:id="pg_409" facs="0419"/>ahead without asking our Treasury or
                            anyone else for advice or suggestions. Later information has shown that
                            one reason why the bonds particularly, and to some extent savings
                            certificates, have not sold well is because the Chinese suspect that
                            their own Government will in some way bilk them of the dollar
                            collateral.</p>
                        <p>You will note that to the extent that the attached memoranda circulated
                            in the Department at least no one should have had any illusions as to
                            the kind of handsome gift which operations of this character would
                            provide for wealthy Chinese speculators. I think the same was
                            appreciated by the Treasury, but the Treasury at that time was jittery
                            about China continuing in the war and was willing to give the Chinese
                            almost anything they asked for.</p>

                                Finance.</note> opinion that the Chinese public might be hesitant
                            about buying foreign currency obligations because of our freezing
                            regulations. This would indicate that the Chinese Government should
                            always have appreciated that the dollars back of the savings
                            certificates would be blocked unless we made an exception to our
                            freezing regulations. For your information Mr. Young is an Adviser of
                            the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>If the Chinese Government is insistent that the certificates be paid off
                            in free dollars it seems to me that they have a very strong talking
                            point in that the Treasury has always played up the fact that China was
                            frozen in the first instance at China’s request and in order to assist
                            China to meet its financial problems. In other words, had not China
                            itself requested it I suppose that there is a very good chance that now
                            unoccupied China might be unblocked or enjoying a general license as
                            liberal as that of the Russians. In the light of these considerations I
                            think the original Treasury telegram might well have infuriated the
                            Chinese.</p>

                                set aside by governmental decree and this action made public.
                                Nevertheless, Dr. Kung expressed willingness to use uninvested part
                                of $200 million as Treasury suggested.</item>

                        <p>223. Your 137, January 26, 9 a.m. For Adler from Secretary of
                                Treasury.<note n="18" xml:id="d333fn18">This telegram was drafted by
                                the Treasury Department in consultation with officers of the
                                Department of State.</note> Please transmit the following message to
                            Dr. Kung:</p>
                        <p>Treasury has given careful consideration to his proposal but regrets that
                            it is not in a position to recommend the modification of its controls so
                            as to leave the U. S. dollar proceeds of such certificates, etc., when
                            paid to the account of a blocked Chinese national, free when maturity is
                            reached.</p>
                        <p>Freezing controls are a fundamental instrument of this Nation’s war
                            effort and security measures. Treasury trusts that he would appreciate
                            that the present proposal would impair the entire control. It would, for
                            example, involve considerable danger that free dollars might be placed
                            at the disposal of enemy agents and other undesirables, <pb n="411" xml:id="pg_411" facs="0421"/>with practical injuries to our common
                            war effort, which both the United States and China wish to avoid.
                            Neither the listing of the original purchasers nor the reporting
                            requirement here would constitute adequate safeguards against these
                            dangers. Moreover, the present proposal would raise many other complex
                            problems regarding U. S. control over funds of all blocked
                            countries.</p>
                        <p>Since our Foreign Funds Control laws were in existence at the time when
                            the certificates, etc., were sold it is to be expected that the
                            purchasers of such certificates, etc. appreciated that there was no
                            commitment on the part of the United States to exempt from its Foreign
                            Funds Control laws the U. S. dollar proceeds which the purchasers would
                            receive at the time of maturity. It is to be assumed that the purchasers
                            of such certificates, etc. understood that an undertaking to this effect
                            could only be given by the United States. Since the Government of China
                            is fully prepared to make payment on these certificates, etc. as
                            contracted, there would seem to be no question of the Government of
                            China’s failing to meet its obligations.</p>
                        <p>The individuals holding the blocked U. S. dollar proceeds of such
                            certificates, etc. would, of course, be entitled to all benefits of our
                            existing general licenses, and, where general licenses are not
                            applicable, specific licenses for the release of such blocked funds
                            could be applied for through the ordinary channels. The Treasury would,
                            of course, give the most favorable consideration to requests for
                            specific licenses for legitimate transactions and, moreover, in
                            accordance with the Treasury’s past practice, the Treasury would be glad
                            to consult with the Stabilization Board prior to the releasing of any of
                            these blocked assets if the Stabilization Board so desired. China may,
                            of course, assure purchasers of these obligations that they may count on
                            the traditional fairness of this Government in dealing with any such
                            assets. [Morgenthau.]</p>

                        <p>260. TF–95 to Secretary Treasury from Adler. Re your 223 of February 14
                                [<hi rend="italic">13</hi>]. Dr. Kung on hearing your message said
                            that he appreciated the need for the maintenance of control measures and
                            that he in no way wished to embarrass the Treasury in its enforcement of
                            the necessary controls. He also appreciated Treasury’s willingness to
                            accord the maximum consideration in regard to requests for funds <pb n="412" xml:id="pg_412" facs="0422"/>for permissible transactions
                            through specific licenses. His objectives in floating the savings
                            certificate issue had been twofold: To sop up <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> and to make United States dollars available to Chinese
                            merchants so that when it became possible for them to place orders for
                            much needed machinery and raw materials in America, they would be in a
                            position to do so, to the mutual advantage of both countries. I pointed
                            out that in any case such orders could not be placed for some time to
                            come and that therefore the present status of the United States dollar
                            proceeds of the certificates would interfere with the attainment of his
                            second objective. He replied that while he was fully aware of this he
                            doubted whether the merchants would be; he repeated that the
                            possibilities of making additional sales of certificates on a
                            significant scale were remote, as Chinese had purchased them in the
                            belief that the United States dollar proceeds would be free. Dr. Kung
                            agrees that the Stabilization Board should be consulted by the Treasury
                            re the release of the blocked United States dollar proceeds of the
                            certificates and is anxious for an arrangement to be set up whereby the
                            Board would make recommendations to the Treasury on applications from
                            holders of certificates for release of their blocked funds when their
                            certificates mature. [Adler.]</p>

                                    then raise with the Stabilization Board the question of working

                                    While the Treasury is willing to refer such cases to the Board
                                    it is felt that such reference of cases should be kept to a

                        <p>Mr. Brigden called on Mr. Hornbeck and said that his Legation had
                            received a somewhat garbled or ambiguous message from London which
                            indicated that the United States was discussing with the Chinese <pb n="414" xml:id="pg_414" facs="0424"/>the problem of exchange rates
                            and of relief for American officials in China.<note n="20" xml:id="d336fn20">For further correspondence on the problem of
                                exchange rates in relation to reverse Lend-Lease negotiations, see

                            that as we were all aware the present exchange situation worked severe
                            hardship on foreign official representatives in China.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Brigden was told that Mr. Playfair of the British Treasury had been
                            in some weeks ago as a result of a telegram which had been received from
                            the British Military Attaché in Chungking and that it seemed likely that
                            the Australian Legation’s information stemmed from this same source. Mr.
                            Brigden was further told that we had for some time been giving
                            consideration to the problem of our official representatives in China in
                            connection with exchange matters but that, unless General Stilwell<note n="21" xml:id="d336fn21">Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding
                                General, United States Army Forces in China, Burma, and
                                India.</note> has discussed the matter informally with the Chinese,
                            we do not believe there has been any direct discussion between American
                            and Chinese officials on this matter. We understand that the Chinese
                            desire that there be no change in the exchange rate and that they
                            further are opposed to the granting of special exchange rates. It was
                            suggested to Mr. Brigden that he might wish to talk to the British
                            Embassy or to Mr. Playfair about the matter or that he might wish to
                            take up with the War Department the question of what arrangements
                            General Stilwell had made on an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> basis. Mr.
                            Brigden said he was interested only in the Australian Legation’s staff
                            in Chungking, not in problems of the British or American military forces
                            in China. Mr. Brigden was told that if things developed in such a way
                            that there appeared to be likelihood that we could work out some
                            satisfactory arrangement with the Chinese authorities we should be glad
                            to notify the Australian Legation. Mr. Brigden expressed his
                            appreciation for this offer.</p>

                        <p>403. In March last year the British Ambassador<note n="22" xml:id="d337fn22">Sir Horace James Seymour.</note> notified the
                            Embassy that he was sending a memorandum to the Foreign Office
                            suggesting that the Chinese Government take measures to prevent the
                            Japanese and other enemy nationals from realizing upon such Chinese
                            Government bearer bonds as might come into their possession <pb n="415" xml:id="pg_415" facs="0425"/>and suggested that the Embassy might
                            wish to take similar action. The Ambassador replied that he did not feel
                            that it would be appropriate to make an official approach in this matter
                            but he did write to Dr. Arthur Young, adviser to the Chinese Minister of
                            Finance, on the subject. In April the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave
                            the British Embassy a reply describing the measures it was taking,
                            measures which were somewhat indefinite and not considered by the
                            British Embassy as satisfactorily meeting the situation. Pertinent
                            correspondence being forwarded by pouch.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Young has now informed me in conversation that the subject has been
                            receiving consideration and recently the conclusion had been reached to
                            effect registration of Chinese Government foreign currency bonds held
                            abroad, and, in view of actual or potential enemy seizure of such bonds
                            held in places now occupied by the enemy in Europe as well as the Far
                            East, to effect registration while communications and movement of
                            securities from country to country are under strict control. Dr. Young
                            stated that the Chinese Ambassadors in Washington and London<note n="24" xml:id="d337fn24">Wei Tao-ming and V. K. Wellington Koo,
                                respectively.</note> have been given instructions on the subject (it
                            is understood that Wellington Koo now en route to London via America is
                            carrying those instructions with him) but before taking action they are
                            to discuss the subject with both governmental and private authorities of
                            United States and Great Britain.</p>

                                    China should be allowed by the United States Government as long
                                    as such remittances are made through unoccupied China, the

                                    TF–72, whether the Chinese Government desires the continuation

                                    such as Shanghai and Canton. <pb n="416" xml:id="pg_416" facs="0426"/>The Treasury would be pleased to have Dr.

                                <item>Treasury and Censorship officials are also concerned about
                                    instructions originating in the United States which are being
                                    sent by letter or cable to persons in unoccupied China directing
                                    them to forward funds to persons in occupied China, including
                                    Shanghai and Hong Kong and Kwangchowan. The Treasury and
                                    Censorship officials are concerned because there is no
                                    indication that such instructions are passed on or are even
                                    coming to the attention of the Government of China. Therefore,
                                    these instructions originating in the United States may be
                                    resulting in remittances to occupied China which are not being
                                    controlled either by the United States or Chinese Government. It
                                    is felt that such instructions should not hereafter be permitted

                                    which had the effect of transferring funds from unoccupied to

                            <item>Dr. Kung informs me that he would prefer to have remittances from
                                the United States even to fully occupied China maintained as long as
                                they are effected in accord with general license 75 and via
                                Chungking, so that they are subject to Government control. He
                                indicated that many families in occupied areas, particularly certain
                                areas in Kwangtung, are dependent for their livelihood on support
                                from <pb n="417" xml:id="pg_417" facs="0427"/>relatives abroad and
                                that to cut off such support would rouse discontent among overseas
                                Chinese whose political influence is out of proportion to their
                                numbers.</item>

                                the United States to unoccupied China which result in the transfer
                                of funds to occupied China. At the same time he welcomes your
                                suggestion that such instructions be channeled through an agency of
                                the Central Government. He stated that he will immediately take up
                                the question of setting up such an agency with the Central Bank. I
                                understood that the Central Bank intends to designate the Bank of
                                China, Chungking, as its agent for this purpose and shall notify you
                                as soon as arrangement is arranged. [Adler.]</item>

                                submitted by Dr. Kung at about the same time. Main difference
                                between Kung and Treasury scheme is that in former (subject to your
                                approval) applications for unfreezing United States dollar proceeds
                                of savings certificates would be forwarded to Treasury through
                                Board. Board decided that Treasury scheme the more feasible in

                                awaiting his reply before asking me to inform you

                                Agency, regarding remittances to occupied areas in Kwangtung. The

                                amended to permit remittances to occupied areas in Kwangtung. The
                                Bank of China has been informed that revision of General Ruling 11
                                will not be considered by the Treasury at this time and that any

                                <item>The Treasury has been informed that the proposal of the
                                    Ministry of Finance to extend favorable treatment to consulates
                                    and embassies in connection with the conversion of foreign
                                    exchange into <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> for their expenditures
                                    provides that the foreign exchange which is received from such
                                    foreign consular and diplomatic bodies will not be credited to
                                    the account of the Stabilization Board of China, but instead
                                    will be put in a separate account with the Central Bank. The
                                    Treasury does not understand why special treatment is being
                                    accorded to these foreign exchange receipts and is disturbed
                                    that the Stabilization Board is not the ultimate recipient of
                                    such foreign exchange receipts.</item>

                                    Ministry of Finance whereby foreign missionary, philanthropic
                                    and educational organizations would have their contributions for
                                    famine relief matched by the Government of China and would be
                                    granted the official rate plus 50%, the Treasury feels that any
                                    arrangement worked out should continue to keep the Stabilization
                                    Board as the recipient of foreign exchange receipts from

                                    organizations. The Treasury cannot see any reason why present

                                    Board regarding disposition of foreign exchange should be

                                government or semi-government institutions. This is desirable from
                                point of view of Chinese as well as foreign business interests; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) granting permission to Hong Kong and
                                Shanghai Bank will serve as precedent for subsequent inclusion of

                            Province, there is enclosed a copy of a memorandum of conversation of
                            June 21, 1943<note n="30" xml:id="d346fn30">Not printed.</note> with Dr.
                            T. F. Tsiang, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the
                            Executive Yuan, in regard to the food shortage in Kwangtung and the food
                            problem in other areas in Free China.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Tsiang states that the high prices offered by the Japanese in areas
                            adjacent to the famine region in Kwangtung are resulting in shipments of
                            rice from unoccupied to occupied areas and that, unless this trade is
                            stopped, the shipment of large quantities of rice to the famine area
                            will not solve the food problem there. He points out that the area has
                            never been self-supporting in foodstuffs and that the influx of refugees
                            from Japanese-occupied areas has made the situation more serious. The
                            people of this area who formerly depended upon remittances from abroad
                            are particularly hard hit due to the cessation of overseas remittances
                            from the South Seas. Those who receive remittances from the United
                            States have further increased the seriousness of the problem through
                            their purchases and hoarding of rice. Dr. Tsiang is of the opinion that
                            even favorable harvests will not give adequate relief to famine
                            sufferers in this area and states that the Central Government is giving
                            serious attention to the situation.</p>
                        <p>According to Dr. Tsiang, timely rainfall has improved the prospects for
                            good harvests in Fukien, Honan and Szechuan and there <pb n="422" xml:id="pg_422" facs="0432"/>seems to be no cause for alarm with
                            respect to the food supply in these provinces.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Perkins called at the Treasury on July 7 at the request of the office
                            of Mr. White, Assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury, and talked to
                            Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Friedman. Mr. Friedman explained that the Treasury
                            officials wished to inform us of recent developments in financial
                            relations with the Chinese Government.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Friedman said that as of June 30, 1943, $200,000,000 of the
                            $500,000,000 credit to China had been withdrawn by the Chinese
                            Government. The Chinese financial authorities, apparently at the
                            instance of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,<note n="31" xml:id="d347fn31">President of the Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier).</note> have now
                            requested that they be allowed to withdraw an additional $200,000,000 of
                            this fund to purchase gold from the United States. It was explained that
                            in as much as the fund is pledged to China, that country can make
                            withdrawals for such use as may be desired. At the same time the
                            Treasury is interested in seeing that the fund be used in furtherance of
                            the war effort. Following consideration of China’s proposal, it has been
                            decided in principle that the amount desired will be released to China,
                            although technical details remain to be worked out.</p>
                        <p>Upon Mr. Perkins’ inquiry as to the practical use which the Chinese might
                            intend to make of the gold purchase, it was explained that presumably
                            shipment of gold to China would be handled in the same manner as
                            shipment of bank notes. One million dollars in gold weighs one ton,
                            consequently 200 tons of air cargo space would be required for the total
                            shipments. It is anticipated that a free gold market in China will be
                            established, present regulations against trading in gold having first
                            been rescinded.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Bernstein explained that gold importations should be helpful
                            economically, both as a psychological and as a practical financial
                            measure; under the latter heading would be the anticipated diversion of
                            excess Chinese funds into the purchase of gold, as well as a probable
                                <pb n="423" xml:id="pg_423" facs="0433"/>decrease in commodity
                            purchases. It is hoped at the same time that the rate of bank note issue
                            could be decreased to some extent.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Perkins thanked the two Treasury representatives for their courtesy
                            in making this information available to us.</p>

                            United States. We have discussed this matter with the Chinese
                            representatives and have informed Mr. Perkins of the Par Eastern

                        <p>We can’t very well refuse to sell the Chinese gold for the dollars they
                            have, though we feel that the resultant loss to China of foreign
                            exchange resources is hardly outweighed by the advantages of the step.
                            In any case the operations would have to be very skillfully handled by
                            China if any significant contribution toward checking inflation is to be

                     </head>
                            <p>During the six years of our war of resistance China’s military
                                expenditure has been increasing continuously. According to the
                                national budget of the current year, the estimated expenditure was
                                originally placed at 362,000,000,000 yuan, while the estimated
                                income was given as 232,000,000,000 yuan, representing about 65% of
                                the total expenditure. The remaining 35% is entirely met by
                                increased note issue.</p>
                            <p>Owing to military requirements and the requests made by the American
                                Military Mission, the Chinese Government has undertaken to build, or
                                improve, the airfields in various parts of the country and to
                                increase their equipment, as well as to improve the Yunnan–Burma
                                highway and other necessary highways and railways. Each enterprise
                                often necessitated the expenditure of 4,000,000,000 to 5,000,000,000
                                yuan, making a total of additional requirements amounting to over
                                30,000,000,000 yuan.</p>
                            <pb n="424" xml:id="pg_424" facs="0434"/>
                            <p>Furthermore, owing to the difficulties of transportation and the
                                small volume of supplies received under the American Lend-Lease
                                    Act,<note n="33" xml:id="d348fn33">Approved March 11, 1941; 56
                                    Stat 31.</note> the Chinese Government has been obliged to
                                provide ways and means of increasing the production of military
                                supplies in order to meet the demands of the war. All such expenses
                                are beyond what is provided by the budget, and the Chinese
                                Government is compelled to further increase its note issue in order
                                to meet the situation. For these reasons there has been constant
                                tendency toward inflation. In order to remedy the situation and to
                                stabilize the price of commodities, it is necessary to adopt
                                measures having the effect of checking inflation. Through increased
                                taxation and other means, the Government has withdrawn a certain
                                portion of the notes in circulation, but there is still by far the
                                larger portion in the hands of the people which is being used toward
                                the purchase and accumulation of commodities, resulting in the
                                further rising of prices and in making livelihood increasingly
                                difficult.</p>
                            <p>The chief purpose for the proposed purchase and sale of gold is to
                                withdraw large quantities of notes now in circulation. The fact that
                                each ounce of gold is worth now about 8,000 yuan shows the
                                psychology of Chinese people toward gold. To obtain the desired
                                result, it is only necessary for the time being to have bullion
                                which can be handled easily. However, the question of coinage is
                                being given careful study and can be best taken up at the time of
                                reorganization of Chinese currency.</p>
                            <p>According to Madame Chiang, the proposal which we are making—that is,
                                the purchase of 200,000,000 dollars’ worth of gold with the United
                                States loan—has received the approval of President Roosevelt and
                                Secretary Morgenthau in principle. It is earnestly hoped that it can
                                be realized at an early date. We always appreciate and welcome
                                suggestions and advices from Secretary Morgenthau and Dr. White, but
                                in this particular case we are influenced by actual conditions in
                                China, and we feel that it has to be done in the way we suggested in
                                order to reap the desired benefits. It is earnestly hoped that we
                                shall not lose this good opportunity of checking inflation.</p>

                        <p>1184. I have been informed in confidence by an official of Cabinet rank
                            that the average monthly rate of currency expansion for the current year
                            (which in China closely reflects the rate of inflation) has reached over
                            3 billion Chinese dollars, that is, expansion is now at the rate of
                            approximately 40 billion Chinese dollars per annum as compared with an
                            average monthly rate of a million [<hi rend="italic">billion?</hi>] and
                            a half or slightly over 19 billion dollars annually for 1942. This
                            represents an increase of some 50 percent and exceeds the budget
                            estimate of 1943 of 36 odd billion dollars expenditure.</p>
                        <p>If the 1943 estimate of receipts of 23 odd billion dollars were correct,
                            the increase in note issue should more than cover the budgetary deficit
                            even with the continuing general rate of the rise in costs of materials,
                            food and services of approximately 10 percent a month. However,
                            according to several sources, the revenues for this year will not exceed
                            15 billion dollars and while the preliminary budget estimate for the
                            1944 calendar year contemplates no greater revenues the estimated
                            expenditures will possibly be about double those for 1943 or some 73
                            billion dollars. The gap between revenues and expenditures in 1944 may
                            accordingly be expected to increase by 200%. Incidentally Kunming
                            reported that during May and June NB bank notes having a face value of
                            $5,001,200,000. [and?] $4,424,000 respectively were imported into
                            China.</p>

                     </head>
                            <p>On July 14, that the Treasury is prepared in principle to agree to
                                the Chinese request to purchase $200 million of gold out of the $500
                                million financial aid as a means of helping to check inflation in
                                China. Dr. Kung was also informed that a formal request was, of
                                course, necessary before any definitive decision and action could be
                                taken.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese government has already drawn on the Treasury to the
                                extent of $240 million out of the $500 million financial aid:—$200
                                million has been set aside as backing for Chinese Government savings
                                certificates and bond issues; $20 million was used to purchase gold,
                                and $20 million is being used for the printing of banknotes and the
                                purchase of relative materials. The purchase of gold with an
                                additional $200 million will mean that in total the Chinese will
                                have used $440 million out of the $500 million financial aid.</p>
                            <p>In the message to Dr. Kung, as well as in discussions with the
                                representatives of the Chinese Government in Washington, it has been
                                made clear that the Treasury is acquiescing to the Chinese proposal
                                because the Government of China deems that the sale of gold to the
                                public will aid its war effort by helping to fight inflation and
                                hoarding and that, therefore, the decision to purchase the gold is
                                primarily the responsibility of the Chinese Government. Furthermore,
                                the Chinese have been urged to give careful consideration to the
                                best ways of using the gold, particularly because of the great
                                costs, difficulties and dangers inherent in the use of gold as a
                                means of checking inflation under conditions existing in China at
                                present. We especially stressed the fact that the Chinese Government
                                will by this step be sacrificing large amounts of foreign exchange,
                                which could be used in the post-war period to pay for imports needed
                                for reconstruction and rehabilitation.</p>
                            <pb n="427" xml:id="pg_427" facs="0437"/>
                            <p>The use of gold coins as against bullion for the purpose was
                                carefully considered. It was felt both by us and by the Chinese
                                Government that this technique for selling the gold to the public
                                would not be feasible in the present instance, primarily because it
                                would be necessary to give the gold coins a fixed monetary value,
                                while it is contemplated that the price of gold in terms of yuan
                                will change frequently and substantially as time goes on.</p>
                            <p>The suggestion was therefore made to the Chinese representatives in
                                Washington that the gold might be sold to the public in China in
                                small bars of one or two ounces in order to reach the widest
                                possible section of the Chinese public and such bars might have some
                                engraving which might suggest the United States origin of the
                                financial aid, if the Government of China so wished.</p>

                                emphasizes its role as appointed agent of Chinese Government. This

                                already expressed his views on the plan, when it came up for
                                discussion at last Board meeting Chinese members abstained from
                                making comment on the plan. They would not commit themselves to

                        <p>A. The institution of an effective scheme for this use of gold in
                                    China—with adequate controls—would undoubtedly have beneficial
                                    effects in checking inflation. It is clear that if the scheme is
                                    to yield significant advantages the gold would have to be sold
                                    in China at a price or prices never falling below approximately
                                    CN dollars 5000 per oz. At the same time it is impossible on the
                                    basis of existing information to make even a rough estimate: <list>

                                            gold at price or prices which would make the project
                                            worthwhile from the point of view of combatting
                                            inflation; it is tentatively suggested that it would not

                                            times what the price would be at U. S. dollars 35 per

                                        <item>Of therefore how far the current prices of gold (see D
                                                [<hi rend="italic">B?</hi>], 2 below) would fall
                                            under the impact of substantial imports of gold.</item>
                                    </list>
                  </p>
                                <p>It follows that a rational scheme for selling gold in China would
                                    necessarily be experimental in its initial stages.</p>
                                <p>For this reason and in order to enhance the chances that maximum
                                    advantages accrue to China, I would suggest that the Treasury
                                    before agreeing in principle and certainly before making any
                                    specific commitment to sell sizeable amounts of gold to China
                                    wait until the Chinese Government submits a concrete plan to the
                                    Treasury. From the information available here it appears that no
                                    such plan has as yet been worked out by the Chinese authorities.
                                    Perhaps it would be possible for the Treasury discreetly to ask
                                    the Chinese Government what its plans are
                                specifically.</p>
                            <p>B. 1. Your B, 1. My impression is that it is somewhat vaguely
                                    contemplated that the gold would be sold to the banks and
                                    bullion dealers as well as to the public.</p>

                                    <item>From the point of view of obtaining the maximum
                                        anti-inflationary effects, it would be desirable to prohibit
                                        the Government banks from buying gold except as
                                        intermediaries for its resale to the public, for the Central
                                        Bank could expand the note issue for the <pb n="430" xml:id="pg_430" facs="0440"/>specific purpose of
                                        acquiring gold which would defeat the whole point of the
                                        sale of gold to China, while the other Government banks
                                        could use their facilities for borrowing from the Central
                                        Bank in order to acquire gold, a process which would also
                                        lead to the Central Bank’s increasing its note issue. It is
                                        probable that the Chinese Government would be reluctant to
                                        adopt a measure prohibiting all Government banks from buying
                                        gold to hold, especially in view of the current trend first
                                        to strengthen all Government banks vis-à-vis commercial and
                                        private banks and second to strengthen the Central Bank
                                        vis-à-vis the other Government banks. While the Government
                                        banks could circumvent the prohibition by having private
                                        agents buy the gold for them such a prohibition might to
                                        some extent serve as a deterrent.</item>

                                    However, such leakage could be kept to fairly low levels given
                                    the wholehearted cooperation of the Central Government special

                                    governments as that of Yunnan. An additional suggested check is
                                    the registration of all purchasers but this would tend to
                                    discourage prospective purchasers who would be afraid that the
                                    authorities might subsequently use the information in the
                                    registration records to extract the gold from them on terms
                                    advantageous to the authorities and disadvantageous to
                                    themselves.</p>
                                <p>For your information: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) I am reliably
                                    informed that small amounts of gold have recently been smuggled
                                    from India to Yunnan and then into Indochina. (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) There is a report current that Chinese in Shanghai
                                    have recently sent an agent or agents into Free China with GST
                                    dollars 25,000,000 with which to purchase US dollar backed
                                    savings certificates.</p>
                                <p>3. Re your B, 3. Again there is no clear view here as to whether
                                    gold should be minted into gold coins or sold in form of gold
                                    bars. It would appear that the latter course would be preferable
                                    in view of the difficulties of giving gold coins a fixed CN
                                    dollar value and in view of danger arising from probability that
                                    coins would be in smaller denomination than bars and that coins
                                    would tend to displace <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> as a medium
                                    of circulation and exchange.</p>
                                <p>It would be most appropriate if there were imprinted on the gold
                                    coins or bars some indication that they constituted part of U.S.
                                    financial aid to China.</p>

                        <p>A. In view of the fact that a satisfactory scheme would be experimental
                            in its first stages and in view of the need for checks and safeguards I
                            would like to submit the following for your consideration.</p>

                            <item>The Treasury if and when it decided to agree in principle to sell
                                gold to China might suggest that Chinese Government make a beginning
                                by selling the 48,000 ounces of gold now in possession of the
                                Central Bank plus such other amounts of gold as Government has
                                acquired from current production (see D, 3, below<note n="37a" xml:id="d354fn38">Reference may be to section III, B, <ref target="#pg_432">p. 432</ref>.</note>).</item>

                            <item>While the gold now in China was being sold, the Treasury might
                                agree to sell say U. S. dollars 10,000,000 of gold to Chinese
                                Government and [then wait?] and see how the sale of this gold was
                                going in China before making any further sale of gold to the Chinese
                                Government. To save transportation expenses, it would be desirable
                                to make a swap with preferably the Indian authorities and
                                alternatively the South African or Australian authorities whereby
                                the gold would be sent to China from either India or South Africa or
                                Australia and the same amount would be placed in earmark for the
                                sender with Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>It might be possible and it certainly would be desirable from the
                                point of view of China’s interests to tie up Board with any
                                arrangement for sale of gold in China and give Board power to fix
                                price or prices of gold and to exercise some supervision over its
                                sale. It will be recalled that paragraph 1 (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) of 1941 agreement gives the Board power to deal in gold for
                                account of the fund; perhaps this power could be broadened to enable
                                Board to exercise above functions in any revision of 1941
                                agreement.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The advantages of bringing the Board into the picture are obvious as the
                            Board’s participation would increase the chances of success of any
                            scheme that is worked out and curtail abuses. If Chinese Government
                            objected to the Board’s participation in any plan for selling gold in
                            China on the grounds that the sale of gold had nothing to do with the
                            British member, perhaps this objection could be overcome by having a
                            committee of the Board consisting of the Chinese member and the American
                            representative function for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Section III:</hi>
                  </p>
                        <p>I have been collecting all available information on gold market in China
                            but it is scanty and does not throw light on main question how much can
                            be absorbed at a price or prices which would make the project
                            worthwhile. Any further data that can be obtained will of course be
                            transmitted. The following is a summary of the main items of
                            interest.</p>
                        <pb n="432" xml:id="pg_432" facs="0442"/>
                        <p>1. Gold markets exist in Chungking, Kunming, Chengtu, Kweilin,
                                Kweiyang and Sian.</p>
                            <p>2. The current “agreed” price of gold in Chungking is CN dollars
                                    11,500 buying, CN 13,000 selling per <hi rend="italic">sueliang</hi> or Chinese oz. (which equals 1.00471 oz.
                                    troy). The price of gold in Kunming is about the same as in
                                    Chungking while in Kweilin it is lower. In Chengtu it is now CN
                                    12,000 buying and CN 15,200 selling per Chinese oz. There has
                                    consequently been a drain of gold from centers to Chengtu.</p>
                                <p>It can be safely assumed that the price of gold in Free China
                                    will continue to rise concomitantly with rising prices, unless
                                    and until either news leaks out of the impending import of
                                    sizeable amounts of gold or gold is actually imported for
                                    sale.</p>
                                <p>According to recent reports from Shanghai, the Japs have lately
                                    relaxed their control of the Shanghai gold market which has
                                    consequently become more active. The price of gold at Shanghai
                                    is CUB dollars 6500 per Chinese oz. The CRB dollar was last
                                    reported to be exchanging for CN dollars 1.4 in
                                Shanghai.</p>
                            <p>3. There are no estimates available on the amount of gold that is
                                traded in Free China, but it is quite small absolutely and
                                negligible in comparison to the amounts China contemplates
                                purchasing; nor are there any estimates on the actual supply of gold
                                in Free China.</p>
                        <p>A. The gold that has gone into the markets comes from private hoards
                                of gold bars and jewelry and from what can be smuggled from current
                                production. There has also been some smuggled from India.</p>
                            <p>B. According to an article by the head of the Chinese Geological
                                    Survey published in December 1942 in the magazine <hi rend="italic">Mining and Metallurgy</hi>, a translation of
                                    which is being forwarded by pouch,<note n="37b" xml:id="d354fn39">Not printed.</note> the gold production of
                                    Sikang, Szechwan, Kwangsi, Kweichow and Yunnan rose from 39,200
                                    Chinese ozs. in 1935 to 68,200 in 1939. In addition gold is
                                    purchased in Hunan, Kiangsi, Fukien, Hupeh, and the northwestern
                                    provinces. The author states that as a result of Government
                                    efforts to encourage gold production after 1937, annual gold
                                    production was reported to have reached 300,000 Chinese ozs. in
                                    1939 and 1940, but does not indicate whether this figure
                                    includes the production of Shanghai and Sinkiang where control
                                    of gold supply was and has remained the exclusive monopoly of
                                    the provincial governments. Since the outbreak of the Pacific
                                    war gold production has fallen off as a result of the
                                    maintenance of the official price of gold while all other prices
                                    were rising, but—the author suggests—with the lifting of the old
                                    official price annual production might again reach 300,000
                                    Chinese oz.</p>
                                <p>According to the same source, the Government banks have bought
                                    about 1,000,000 oz. of Chinese gold in the last few years which
                                    he <pb n="433" xml:id="pg_433" facs="0443"/>assumes to be at the
                                    Government’s disposal in China now. This assumption, however, is
                                    contrary to the statements of a number of responsible officials
                                    according to which the only gold now at the Government’s
                                    disposal is the 48,000 oz. in the Central Banking Division.
                                    According to these officials, the remainder of the gold was
                                    transported prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War, and little
                                    or none has since been purchased by the Government.</p>
                            <p>C. For your information I learn from a reliable source that Dr. Kung
                                feels quite confident that the Treasury will sell large amounts of
                                gold to China and that the basis of his confidence is that the
                                President is purported to have given his consent to Mme. Chiang
                                Kai-shek when she submitted the proposal to him that China purchase
                                large amounts of gold from the United States. [Adler.]</p>

                                    <item>Dr. T. F. Tsiang of Executive Yuan in informal
                                        conversation with me on 20th indicated that while a few high
                                        government officials regarded sale of gold in China as a
                                        panacea, in better informed government circles it was
                                        tentatively estimated that about 1 million oz. gold could be
                                        sold at roughly CN dollars 8,000 per oz. which would yield
                                        enough to cover approximately one fourth of probable deficit
                                        for 1943. Dr. Tsiang felt that in absence of definite
                                        knowledge as to scale on which gold will be absorbed at
                                        worth while prices sale of gold should be begun
                                        experimentally and that if experiment is unsuccessful it
                                        should be scrapped.</item>

                        <p>1270. For Department and Treasury only. 1. At the risk of giving matter
                            more emphasis than it perhaps merits at present, we report that <pb n="435" xml:id="pg_435" facs="0445"/>there appear to be mounting
                            evidence that not only is smuggling and trade at points between occupied
                            and unoccupied China expanding but that commercial intercourse by
                            Chinese travelers who proceed at will between main centers of the two
                            areas such as Shanghai and Chungking is on the increase. It is reliably
                            reported that frequently some of these persons use Japanese official
                            facilities such as Japanese military planes from Shanghai to Canton for
                            part of their journey in this direction. The informant<note n="41" xml:id="d358fn41">A Chinese with confidential connections both at

                            that this informant brought with him to Chungking from Shanghai CN
                            dollars 25,000,000 appears from a later conversation with him to have
                            been not entirely accurate. He states that in recent months he and his
                            associates in Shanghai have forwarded varying amounts totaling that sum
                            for the purchase of United States currency savings certificates and that
                            the certificates were actually purchased and in due course delivered in
                            Shanghai.)</p>
                        <p>From what he has told us and from other sources it appears that organized
                            trade in small bundles (“imports” into Free China consisting chiefly of
                            so-called luxury goods) as carried on over the Lunghai route with
                            regular stations along the way at which payment is made, that a lively
                            exchange business has grown up at these points. Trade is carried on even
                            in currency; he states that he brought with him 1 million dollars in CRB
                            notes which he disposed of at the rate of 1.06 to 1. According to a
                            leading informed banker here, the more “regular” trade in goods over the
                            Lunghai route alone amounts to some CN 30 million per month. There is
                            not available any estimate as to the value of the more sporadic trade
                            and the extensive smuggling in other areas but it must amount to a
                            figure several times that of the trade mentioned above.</p>
                        <p>2. According to the Consul at Kweilin<note n="44" xml:id="d358fn44">Arthur R. Ringwalt.</note> and to information said to have been
                            received by American military officers from a Kweilin banker, there has
                            reportedly organized a “semiofficial” company known as Yuhua Chuang,
                            capitalized at CN 100 million, under the direction of General Tai Li,
                            head of the principal Chinese Secret Service, to control and legalize
                            trade between occupied and unoccupied areas in south and southeast
                            China. We have been informed on good authority that some time ago Tai Li
                            was requested in the highest places <pb n="436" xml:id="pg_436" facs="0446"/>to organize a company for the purpose of bringing under
                            control smuggling operations and the profits therefrom; we know
                            definitely that Tai Li is operating transportation companies in areas
                            close to occupied China.</p>
                        <p>3. The Consul at Kweilin also reports that Japanese agents in recent
                            weeks have introduced into unoccupied China large sums in counterfeit
                            Bank of China notes printed from plates belonging to the former Chunghua
                            Book Company at Hong Kong. This report has been confirmed by
                            authoritative sources.</p>
                        <p>The Consul cites further reports at Kweilin that the counterfeit notes
                            brought into unoccupied China total 10 billion dollars (an amount which
                            seems to us fantastic and which should probably be reduced to say 100
                            million); that they entered China through Kwangchowan; and that with
                            them the Japanese are purchasing strategic materials in Free China at
                            many times the market prices and are in general accelerating economic
                            deterioration in unoccupied China. The Consul states also that,
                            according to a Chinese banker in a position to know, the Kweilin branch
                            of the Bank of China has received orders from its head office to accept
                            the bogus notes even [when?] they may be conclusively identified as
                            counterfeit.</p>
                        <p>The Chunghua Book Company previously manufactured bank notes for the
                            Central Government. We are authoritatively informed that at the time of
                            the capture of Hong Kong there fell into Japanese hands not only the
                            plates but a large number of bank notes bearing serial numbers but no
                            “chop” and also large number of notes that were completed except for
                            serial numbers and chops; and that there are now in circulation three
                            categories of these counterfeits: (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) bearing
                            proper serial numbers with counterfeit chop; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                            bearing correct serial numbers and counterfeit chop; and (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) newly printed by the Japanese from the plates.
                            It is believed that the notes being accepted by the Bank of China are
                            those of first and possibly second category and that acceptance is for
                            the purpose of taking them out of circulation. According to one report,
                            notes of the second category are being purchased by Chinese Government
                            bankers at half of their value.</p>
                        <p>4. The economic and political implications of the above, especially

                        <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_57">p. 57</ref>.</note> As regards the
                            current question of the free sale of gold, certain implications are
                            obvious. One political implication for the future may well be that with
                            the expansion of regularized trade secret or otherwise between occupied
                            and Free China there will develop progressively a significant measure of
                            cooperation between officials and others in the respective areas. This
                            may of course turn out to be of temporary benefit to the Central
                            Government when and <pb n="437" xml:id="pg_437" facs="0447"/>if the time
                            comes for the puppets to divert their nominal allegiance from the
                            Japanese to the Central Government. On the other hand, such development
                            will probably also entail taking back into the fold of Quislings, etc.,
                            with the corollary establishment of the latter’s factions and of
                            influence in political as well as commercial affairs.</p>
                        <p>It is of interest that the informant mentioned in paragraph 1 states that
                            one of his missions here is to obtain from highest quarters a promise of
                            “forgiveness” for certain puppets and that two of his closest personal
                            friends are Chen Kung-po, Mayor of Greater Shanghai and one time
                            Secretary to Sun Yat-sen, and Chou Fu-hai, Finance Minister in the
                            Nanking régime. It is possibly of interest that P. N. Chung who prior to
                            the capture of Hong Kong was H. H. Kung’s principal agent there and who
                            was subsequently taken to Shanghai by the Japanese is reliably reported
                            to be on his way to Chungking, apparently without Japanese
                            hindrance.</p>

                            inform you that I have just received from Dr. H. H. Kung, Minister of
                            Finance, the following telegraphic message, dated July 23, 1943, for
                            transmission to you: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“The Chinese Government greatly appreciates the financial aid
                                    accorded to China by the U. S. $500,000,000 credit of last year.
                                    Of this credit U. S. $240,000,000 have been allocated for
                                    special purposes. In order to strengthen China’s monetary
                                    situation and check inflation, which are included in the objects
                                    for which the credit was established, the Chinese Government now
                                    requests the transfer of an additional sum of U. S. $200,000,000
                                    from the credit for the purchase of gold. It is intended to
                                    transport the gold to China to be sold in order to withdraw
                                    currency from circulation and thus help to check the price
                                    increase. Prolongation of the war in China into the seventh year
                                    brings constantly growing strain and difficulty, and the Chinese
                                    Government will greatly appreciate your kindly acceding to this
                                    request. I have authorized Dr. P. W. Kuo and Mr. Hsi Te-mou to

                        <p>1294. As an example of the uncertainties and sometimes suddenly
                            disruptive aspects of the present inflationary process, it is reliably
                            reported that the prices of staple foods at Chengtu are now increasing
                            at the approximate rate of 10 percent per week. On July 6 the price of
                            rice was double that of June 1, of flour almost double, of vegetable oil
                            over one and one half times, of pork over one third as much. The cost of
                            living index (1937 equals 1) in July 1942 was 34.7, in January 1934 was
                            44.1, on June 7, 1943 was 96.3, on July 5, 150.6 and on July 12 was
                            164.7. (See first paragraph of Adler’s message to Treasury in our 1263,
                            July 23<note n="48" xml:id="d360fn48">Not printed.</note>).</p>
                        <p>While the causes of the recent sudden extraordinary increases are varied
                            and complex, an important circumstance is that the application of
                            repressive measures to control prices in Chungking where the
                            Generalissimo takes personal interest in endeavoring to enforce them has
                            driven many speculators in commodities from the provisional capital to
                            Chengtu and other interior places.</p>
                        <p>One possibly serious political aspect of the situation at Chengtu is that
                            it is not at all unlikely that there may result a recrudescence of
                            disturbances in revolt against Central Government authority there.</p>

                        <p>Responsible official Finance Ministry states insurance project still
                            vague. Proposal jointly drawn up by Office of Four Government Banks and
                            Central Trust is for company with CN $60 million capital to take over
                            insurance department of Central Trust and possibly other insurance
                            companies in which Government has an interest. Proposed company would
                            handle war risk insurance and might be given monopoly of reinsurance on
                            Government property but would not handle reinsurance on private
                            property. Capital would be subscribed by Central Trust and Government
                            banks with possibly some national treasury participation. American
                            participation not suggested <pb n="439" xml:id="pg_439" facs="0449"/>and
                            seems most unlikely. Impossible to say yet whether project will

                                replied story was utterly inaccurate, (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)
                                Local manager of Bank of China who was in Hong Kong when it fell
                                informs me that Bank of China’s copper plates and new notes with the
                                Chung Hua book coin, Hong Kong, had been destroyed during siege but
                                that he had heard that new notes printed for Bank of Communications
                                had fallen into Jap hands. In connection with the latter, according
                                to the same source the counterfeiting of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>
                                by the Japs is not systematically organized but carried on by
                                individuals as a private racket.</item>

                            <item>When I saw Dr. Kung on the 29th I asked him about the reports of
                                Jap counterfeiting and the counter measures his Government was
                                adopting. He replied that the amounts of forged <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> notes found in Free China was comparatively small
                                totalling not more than about CN dollars 10 million. He added that
                                Japs have counterfeited BS dollars, Hong Kong dollars and sterling
                                as well as <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>, all of which they have tried
                                to dispose of in occupied territory. The Government had adopted
                                stringent countermeasures, confiscating all counterfeit notes and
                                meting out severe punishment to large holders. Recently a group
                                including soldiers were found trying to smuggle in CN dollars 1.7
                                million of forged notes and all were sentenced, the soldiers by
                                military court.</item>

                            <item>On basis of available evidence, Japs have done much more damage to
                                Chinese economy by buying goods in Free China with bona fide <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> they had acquired—at no cost to
                                themselves in exchange for CEB dollars, FEB dollars, and military
                                yen—or confiscated in occupied territory than they have by
                                circulating bogus <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>. The Japs have used
                                substantial amounts of bona fide <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in this
                                way and are reported to have CN 2 billion left. The consequences of

                        <p>A–28. Embassy’s 1270, July 23, 8 p.m., paragraph 1.</p>
                        <p>1. A new and curious development along those lines, of which we
                                    have been informed by Admiral Yang, is that recently several of
                                    Yang’s agents and several of those of General Tai Li in the
                                    Shanghai-Nanking area were tracked down and seized by the
                                    Japanese but, instead of executing these agents, the Japanese
                                    lectured them on political philosophy from the puppet point of
                                    view and sent them back to Free China to persuade their
                                    colleagues and superiors here that Japanese intentions toward
                                    Chinese were benevolent and that there was no use in continuing
                                    the state of hostilities between Chungking and Japanese-Nanking
                                    troops. Whether this incident is merely symptomatic of Japanese
                                    opportunism in attempting to further Japan’s “soft policy”
                                    toward China or whether it has more far-reaching implications is
                                    an interesting matter for speculation.</p>
                                <p>Another instance of interest is the case of Wu K’ai-hsien, member
                                    of the CEC<note n="53" xml:id="d364fn53">Kuomintang Central

                                    Secret Police in Shanghai who was seized by the Japanese in
                                    March 1942 and who arrived in Chungking May 7, 1943 (section A,
                                    1, (<hi rend="italic">l</hi>), Embassy’s May political
                                    review—despatch no. 1255, June 12<note n="54" xml:id="d364fn54">Not printed.</note>) with, according to some rumors,
                                    Japanese peace proposals. A number of sources state that Wu was
                                    flown from Shanghai to Hong Kong in a Japanese military or naval
                                    plane; it is generally accepted that he made his way from Hong
                                    Kong to Kweilin in unoccupied China; he flew from Kweilin to
                                    Chungking by CNAC plane and was met at the airfield by a number
                                    of Government officials. Subsequently he was feted to some
                                    extent but the welter of rumors about him reportedly soon caused
                                    him to go into retirement. He is now reported by several fairly
                                    reliable sources to have returned to Shanghai or
                                Nanking.</p>
                            <p>2. With reference to paragraph 3 of our 1270 and to Adler’s report
                                for Treasury contained in our 1354, August 2, the Consul at Kweilin
                                states that his informant in regard to the counterfeit notes was a
                                Mr. <pb n="442" xml:id="pg_442" facs="0452"/>C. C. Chen, Kweilin
                                manager of the Bank of China. While the latter does not have a good
                                reputation, there would seem to be little point to his inventing
                                such a story and telling it to the American Consul. Mr. Adler
                                suggests that his own informant, general manager of the Central
                                Bank, might, by stating that the counterfeit or mutilated notes in
                                question are those of the Bank of Communications, be seeking to
                                protect the employees of his bank and of the Bank of China at Hong
                                Kong at the time of its capture who had responsibility for the Chung
                                Hua Book Company’s plates.</p>
                            <p>3. We concur in Mr. Adler’s opinions as expressed in the 3d paragraph
                                of his message contained in our 1354, August 2, referred to

                            in China to Combat Inflation.</p>
                        <p>On July 13 Mr. Berle wrote to Mr. White,<note n="57" xml:id="d366fn57">Letter not printed; it acknowledged Mr. White’s letter of July 10,

                        <p>FE has examined the correspondence on the matter and is impressed by the
                            following points: (1) that the project if well administered has
                            possibilities of helping to check inflation, and of being less wasteful
                            of the American $500,000,000 financial aid than the savings certificate
                            project, (2) that the Chinese Government should be entitled to use
                            proceeds of the $500,000,000 loan as it sees fit, (3) that the Treasury
                            has notified Dr. Kung that it agrees to the project, (4) that Dr. Kung
                            seems to think that the President as well as Mr. Morgenthau has agreed
                            to the scheme, (5) that the Chinese Government has formally requested
                            the sale to it of $200,000,000 of gold after having been told by the
                            Treasury that great costs, difficulties, dangers, and sacrifices of
                            foreign exchange are inherent in the project, and (6) that competent
                            Chinese as well as Mr. Adler favor the initiation of the project on an
                            experimental basis.</p>
                        <p>It has been noted that Mr. Adler believes that, with adequate controls,
                            an effective scheme for the use of gold in China would undoubtedly have
                            beneficial effects in checking inflation. Mr. Adler, however, does not
                            appear to believe the Chinese have yet worked out any such scheme and he
                            raises the question whether it would be possible for the Treasury
                            discreetly to ask them just what their plan is. Mr. Adler has some
                            apparently very good ideas on the subject, in particular, the
                            desirability of prohibiting the government banks from buying gold except
                            as intermediaries for resale to the public. Mr. Adler also makes what
                            seems to us a valuable suggestion, namely, that the scheme be put in
                            motion by the sale to the public of 48,000 oz. of gold now in the
                            possession of the Central Bank, this gold to be replaced by a like sum
                            from South Africa or Australia and the same amount to be earmarked for
                            such shipper in the Federal Reserve Bank in New York.</p>
                        <p>In the light of conditions in China, FE agrees with Mr. Adler that it
                            would be advisable for the Treasury discreetly to ask the Chinese to
                            explain to us precisely how they plan to use the gold for combatting
                            inflation and that the project should be begun experimentally.</p>
                        <p>With the foregoing points in mind, we have drafted a letter to Mr. White
                            for Mr. Berle’s signature.<note n="58" xml:id="d366fn58">Not sent; see

                        <p>Mr. Berle is on leave and not due back until August 16. Otherwise, I
                            think this letter would be all right to initial as a sequel to his
                            letter <pb n="444" xml:id="pg_444" facs="0454"/>of July 13 which stated
                            that he expected to communicate further with Mr. White with regard to
                            the entire matter at an early date. However, the actual content of the
                            letter is very slight. The stated purpose of China in importing gold
                            being to mop up surplus currency, the gold should not be sold to
                            government banks which might finance the purchase by issuing additional
                            paper currency. Similarly, the suggestion that the importation be
                            stopped if it proves not to be working well, is fairly self-evident.</p>
                        <p>Without inquiry, I assume that these ideas have been mentioned by the
                            Treasury in their conversations with the Chinese. How far the Treasury
                            can go in emphasizing them is another matter.</p>
                        <p>If Adler’s suggestion that no gold be sold at less than eight thousand
                            Chinese National dollars per ounce is followed, we have Dr. Tsiang’s
                            estimate in Chungking’s 1260<note n="59" xml:id="d367fn59">July 22, 8
                                p.m., <ref target="#pg_434">p. 434</ref>.</note> that the equivalent
                            of $35,000,000 American money in gold could be sold, leaving
                            $165,000,000 of gold which could be sold only at a lower price. China
                            may not work to Adler’s minimum price specification, or Tsiang’s
                            estimate may be wrong.</p>
                        <p>With Messrs. Berle and White away I think the Dept. might forego written
                            comment to the Treasury on this matter.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                            telegram no. 1184, July 14, 1 p.m., in regard to the rate of currency
                            expansion (which <pb n="445" xml:id="pg_445" facs="0455"/>in China
                            closely approximates the rate of inflation), and to enclose, for the
                            Department’s information, a copy of a report dated June 24, 1943<note n="61" xml:id="d369fn61">Not printed.</note> submitted to the
                            Ministry of Finance by Dr. Arthur N. Young, American adviser to that
                            Ministry, which was furnished us by Dr. Young in strict confidence.
                            While the report was written two months ago, the observations which Dr.
                            Young makes in it are as applicable now as then, especially as the
                            economic deterioration in China has continued to progress at about the
                            same rate as that of the time at which the report was written.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Young points out that the financial and economic situation in China
                            continues to worsen; that while at the time of writing there was no
                            apparent tendency for the general rate of price increase to grow, in
                            some areas the rate had lately increased under influence of bad crops or
                            other adverse events; that the steady rise averaging 7 or 8% monthly was
                            inexorable and that the average of retail prices was close to one
                            hundred times the pre-1937 level (a figure applicable to Chungking but
                            not, for example, to Kunming where the average rate has reportedly
                            reached almost two hundred times the pre-1937 level).</p>
                        <p>Included in the report is a table showing the upward course in China
                            compared with that in Austria from 1914 to 1923 and showing that so far
                            the pattern has been similar except that in 1943 the level in China had
                            risen in seven years to a greater height (9,680%) than after seven years
                            of inflation in Austria (5,552%) and that in the next three years in
                            Austria the level rose to 1,743,000%. Dr. Young does not predict a
                            similarly fantastic acceleration in China during the next three years
                            (he states that continuation of the recent trend will lead to a doubling
                            about every 8 or 10 months). In this connection it may be mentioned that
                            economic and financial experts seem in general to be in agreement that
                            inflation of itself will not result in economic collapse in the near
                            future because of the circumstance that the great majority of China’s
                            population is agricultural and lives off the land. In this sense the
                            British Embassy’s statement (Department’s instruction no. 351, July 27,
                                1943<note n="62" xml:id="d369fn62">Not printed, but see despatch No.
                                9973, July 6, from the Ambassador in the United Kingdom, <ref target="#pg_70">p. 70</ref>.</note>) that the present situation
                            in China seems “to depend more on crop prospects than on anything else”
                            is correct—provided other imponderable factors remain more or less as
                            they are.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Young considers that the determining factors as regards the future
                            are: the extent of the Government’s deficit; the state of confidence
                            which largely depends upon the military situation especially in and
                            adjoining China; and the crops.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Young mentions among the results of the price increase: insidious
                            undermining of China’s governmental structure; impairment <pb n="446" xml:id="pg_446" facs="0456"/>of the war effort; weakening of the
                            internal position of the Government; and serious adverse effects upon
                            the prospect for political and economic construction. He mentions that
                            many of the Chinese troops are undernourished and lack stamina and
                            reserve strength for serious fighting; that military officers are
                            tempted to engage in trade and other gainful activities, to collect
                            money upon the movement of goods, and to “squeeze” the troops under
                            them; that many civil employees suffer malnutrition with resultant
                            reduced efficiency; that many good Government employees are resigning;
                            that concurrent posts are being multiplied; that employees indulge in
                            partial absence from duty in order to engage in outside gainful
                            activities; and that in many cases there is recourse to corrupt
                            practices.</p>
                        <p>Beginning on page 3 of his report Dr. Young makes a number of suggestions
                            for remedial action, especially in the field of government including the
                            military service. These suggestions would seem to be largely of academic
                            interest only, as there does not appear to be any prospect that they
                            will be carried into effect.<note n="63" xml:id="d369fn63">In a
                                memorandum dated October 7, Troy L. Perkins of the Division of Far
                                Eastern Affairs observed: “Dr. Young makes a number of sensible
                                suggestions to remedy the situation, most of which have been made
                                before and, as the Embassy indicates in its comment, are not likely
                                to be followed. Most of the suggested reforms are not impractical
                                even under the present war conditions: postponement of long-range
                                public works which do not contribute to the war effort, economies in
                                civil government, rationalization of the tax system, and removal of
                                onerous restrictions on the movement of goods. Remedial action
                                related to the Army would probably be more difficult to carry out,
                                although equally simple measures in this direction would benefit the
                                economic situation enormously.”</note>

                            had opportunity to make desired inquiries. From what we have been able
                            to learn from several well-informed banking and other sources,
                            approximately 50% of the purchases were by private individuals (we have
                            heard of one individual $1,000,000 purchase) and very little purchase by
                            Government banks because of their strict instruction not to purchase
                            certificates for speculative purposes. Two reasons are given by our
                            informants for the recent large sale: that it became known that the
                            Government intended to stop sales and that it was rumored at that time
                            that the Chinese-U. S. dollar rate was to be changed to 30 to 1.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>In connection with the two hundred million dollar gold sale to China, Mr.
                            Friedman of the Treasury Department telephoned to inform me that
                            Treasury was proposing to mint approximately $10,000,000 (US) of the
                            gold into coins which he described as follows: Profile of Sun Yat-sen on
                            one side; American eagle on the other. On the face with the American
                            eagle would be the inscription “United States Mint”, or words to that
                            effect, and a statement of the gold content of the coin (one ounce). On
                            the other face of the coin there would be Chinese characters giving the
                            same information. Mr. Friedman said that the Chinese Government had not
                            agreed to this proposal but that it was hoped that an agreement could be
                            obtained in as much as the Government’s original objection to coins was
                            based on the fact that it would be necessary to state a value in terms
                            of currency which the Chinese Government desired to avoid.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Friedman said that it was anticipated that these coins would
                            circulate more widely than gold bars by furnishing the small investor
                            with a savings or hoarding medium, thus widening the area of
                            effectiveness in retarding inflation.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Friedman asked me whether I thought there would be any objection in
                            the Department to the idea. I told him I thought it a good one and that
                            I would speak to Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Feis. Mr. Hornbeck approved and
                            Mr. Feis interposed no objection. When Mr. Friedman called back I told
                            him of the attitude of Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Feis.</p>

                        <p>1800. A prominent informed Chinese banker tells us in confidence that
                            Kung is now considering not selling to the public the gold to be
                            received from the U. S. but retaining it in the possession of the
                            Chinese Government to constitute a factor in stabilizing public
                            confidence in the currency. The informant states his private opinion
                            that in any case the sending of gold to China will not affect materially
                            the continuing inflationary rise because, even if <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in appreciable amounts is drawn in through its sale, the
                            continuing budgetary deficiency is the primary cause of the inflationary
                            spiral; that to make successful any program of sale of gold to the
                            public it would be necessary to cut the bars into small pieces and
                            probably to make them into ornaments such as rings in order to put gold
                            within the reach of the majority of prospective individual purchasers;
                            and that the Japs will offer a price higher than the Free China price
                            and most of the gold sold will inevitably flow into the occupied areas
                            and into Jap hands.</p>
                        <p>The informant said also that the only effect which the announced program
                            in regard to gold had so far had is that some commodity prices have
                            lowered in terms of gold but not in terms of the currency; and that it
                            was his opinion that the only means of materially effecting the price
                            situation would be, if that were possible, to announce that consumers
                            goods, notably piece goods, were being brought into China from India—a
                            step which would force hoarders to put on the market their stocks which
                            probably amount to a year’s ordinary supply.</p>

                            p.m. A responsible official of the Finance Ministry now <pb n="449" xml:id="pg_449" facs="0459"/>states that the insurance project has
                            been set aside at least temporarily, due to fear that it might be
                            regarded as a step in the direction of Government monopoly. He says that
                            if it should again be brought up for consideration, it will be in such
                            form as to cause no concern to foreign capital; and that the Government
                            is conscious of need for foreign capital and is aware that investors are
                            timid and must be reassured by actions as well as by laws.</p>

                        <p>1847. Following published by Central News Agency, Chungking, October 1:
                                <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“‘The Chinese Government would use 200 million of the U. S.
                                    dollars 500 million loan to buy and bring gold here for the
                                    purpose of combating inflation and stabilizing prices,’ said Dr.
                                    P. H. Chang, Counsellor of the Executive Yuan, at the press
                                    conference held on September 20.</p>
                                <p>Asked how the gold will be used, Dr. Chang replied that the
                                    Ministry of Finance will devise ways and means which however
                                    cannot yet be told.</p>
                                <p>A correspondent asked Dr. Chang ‘when people here are just as
                                    ready to buy gold savings certificates and gold bonds why should
                                    gold be actually imported at all?’ Dr. Chang replied that there
                                    may be some people who prefer to have more tangible things than
                                    bonds and certificates.</p>
                                <p>The same correspondent raised another question as follows: ‘In
                                    view of the difficult transportation, don’t you think that the
                                    available airplane space should be better used for carrying
                                    ammunition which has a direct bearing on your war effort?’ In
                                    reply Dr. Chang said, ‘To combat inflation and to stabilize
                                    prices is also to strengthen our war effort for sound economic
                                    conditions inside the country are as important as supplies of
                                    arms to our fighting forces.’ When the same correspondent
                                    pointed out that whereas gold is bought in America at U. S.
                                    dollars 35 or CN dollars 700 per ounce, it is sold in China for
                                    much more than CN dollars 700 per ounce and therefore it seems
                                    that the Chinese Government is making profit, Dr. Chang
                                    emphatically declared that that is a wrong conception. In this
                                    war, he said, we United Nations must not calculate profit and
                                    loss in dollars and cents; it is cooperation and mutual aid
                                    which will bring about the final victory that really counts. He
                                    asked if, by selling gold, the United States can help China
                                    most, why she should not do so. He further contended that since
                                    the prevailing price for gold in New York is U. S. dollars 35
                                    per ounce and China pays it, there is no loss on the part of the
                                    sellers at all.”</p>

                                Affairs<note n="66" xml:id="d376fn66">Wong Wen-hao.</note>
                            confidentially affirms that Government has not yet reached decision as
                            to utilization of gold. He is privately doubtful whether sale here will
                            materially retard inflation because (1) comparatively few Chinese will
                            be able to purchase even a small amount and (2) even considerable sale
                            would not result in sufficient reduction in currency circulation to be
                            greatly beneficial, especially as the currency issue will necessarily
                            continue to expand by over 3 billion per month. He believes, however,
                            that gold could be used to some extent to stabilize commodity prices by
                            emphasizing it for Government purchase of commodities to be sold at
                            fixed prices.</p>
                        <p>In general he appeared to envisage no solution for China’s inflation
                            problem. He said the tax system, especially collection in kind, was
                            ineffective because of corruption on the part of poorly paid tax
                            officials and was unbearable on the part of the people as evidenced by
                            the result and peasant revolts against it. He said Chiang Kai-shek’s
                            optimistic utterances before the CEC (Embassy’s 1693, September 12<note n="67" xml:id="d376fn67">
                        <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_332">p. 332</ref>.</note>) were made because Chiang
                            wanted to encourage the people and also because the Generalissimo “liked
                            to be an economist.” He said it would be impossible to predict how long
                            the disheartening situation could continue but he thought a bad crisis
                            was unlikely within a year or a year and a half.</p>

                                instructions, Ministry of Finance had drafted a measure according to

                                month would receive official rate plus 50% which he was submitting
                                for Board’s consideration. Board replied taking note of proposal and

                                will indicate the anomalous situation arising from the fact that
                                with going into effect of proposed new arrangement for overseas
                                remittance almost all foreign exchange in payments will receive 30
                                to 1 and will not go to Board while Board will continue to sell
                                foreign exchange under November agreement and on current
                                applications at 20 to 1 and will suggest that it would be much
                                simpler if all China’s foreign exchange transactions were handled at
                                one rate. [Adler.]</item>

                        <p>1474. For Adler from Secretary of the Treasury. Please discuss the
                            following matter with Dr. Kung.</p>
                        <p>The Treasury has received a number of complaints from missionary
                            societies regarding losses resulting to these societies from the
                            existing official exchange rate. The latest complaint received has been
                            from the Maryknoll Fathers.</p>
                        <p>These missionary societies indicate that most of their remittances are
                            for relief purposes. Would it not be possible for Dr. Kung to grant
                            these missionary societies the special rate which is reportedly being
                            given to other relief organizations, at least for that portion of their
                            remittances which are for relief purposes?</p>
                        <pb n="452" xml:id="pg_452" facs="0462"/>
                        <p>It should be pointed out to Dr. Kung that these missionary organizations,
                            like the other charitable and relief organizations which have been
                            sending funds to China, not only make significant contributions to
                            China’s dollar earnings but also are important in educating the American
                            people regarding China and in building good will in the United States
                            for the Chinese people. On numerous occasions these missionary, relief,
                            educational and similar organizations have indicated that they may be
                            forced to discontinue all of their activities on behalf of China because
                            of the artificially high character of the existing exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>Treasury does not desire to raise at this time the general question of a
                            reduction in China’s foreign exchange rate to a realistic level.
                            Therefore, limit your discussion with Dr. Kung to the problems of
                            missionary and similar organizations. [Morgenthau.]</p>

                            from despatch no. 72, October 6, 1943, from the Consul at Kweilin,<note n="69" xml:id="d380fn69">Not printed.</note> on the subject of
                            political and economic conditions in Wuchow, Kwangsi Province. A summary
                            is included in the excerpt from the despatch.</p>
                        <p>Reports of smuggling between free and occupied China have been frequent
                            and apparently well-founded. This illicit trade generally involves the
                            export of strategic materials and foodstuffs from free China and the
                            import of cotton textiles and luxuries from occupied China. The Japanese
                            have been reported in the past to have made substantial purchases in the
                            southeastern part of free China with <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>
                            (Chinese national paper currency) with the triple purpose of obtaining
                            needed goods, reducing the supply of goods in free China and adding to
                            the currency inflation in that area. The Japanese and followers of the
                            puppet Nanking regime have recently shown increasing interest in gold,
                            and the flow of gold, which was formerly reported to have been from
                            Canton and Hongkong to free China, is said to have been reversed. A
                            Chungking banker recently stated to an officer of the Embassy that there
                            is also an increasing interest in <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> in
                            occupied China and that substantial quantities of goods, chiefly cotton
                            goods and luxuries, are coming into free China in exchange for that
                            currency.</p>

                        <p>2041. Embassy’s 1858, October 4. Government spokesman announced about
                            middle of month that some of the gold has already reached China and
                            while no announcement has been made of gold being sold or offered for
                            sale we have been informed in strict confidence by authoritative source
                            that small amounts are actually being sold by Government in order to
                            test the market.</p>
                        <p>We understand, however, that consideration is still being given to
                            question whether the gold might be retained by Government as a reserve
                            to help maintain confidence in the continuously expanding currency and
                            some observers are of opinion that Government is considering retention
                            of the gold for the purpose also of accumulating stock for use in
                            connection with postwar international monetary arrangement.</p>

                            articles by Dr. Chao Shou-yu of Yenching University and Dr. J. Lossing
                            Buck of Nanking University on the subject of China’s obtaining 5,700,000
                            ounces of gold from the United States announcedly for sale in China to

                        <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> Professor Chao and Dr. Buck agree
                                that there is no evidence of a substantial demand for gold as an
                                investment or as a medium of speculation. Professor Chao contends
                                that sale of gold can be no more than a temporary palliative in
                                itself and that strict enforcement of the “Revised Emergency
                                Measures for Control and Regulation of Banks” would be a more
                                effective means of stabilizing prices. Price control measures, he
                                states, have failed because of the craftiness of merchants and the
                                lack of established moral standards among officials. He expresses
                                the hope that the Central Bank will not make loans against gold, as
                                it has against U. S. dollar savings certificates. Dr. Buck points
                                out that the price of gold has consistently <pb n="454" xml:id="pg_454" facs="0464"/>lagged behind commodity prices
                                since the middle of 1940 and that in August, 1940, the purchasing
                                power of gold reached its lowest point since the start of
                                hostilities in China. Sale of a large amount of imported gold might
                                be expected to reduce its purchasing power still further. Gold, he
                                believes, is unattractive as a hedge against a break in commodity
                                prices, as gold prices would inevitably fall along with other
                                commodity prices. It is currency therefore, rather than gold that
                                would be likely to be hoarded as a hedge. The price of gold in
                                Chengtu, according to Mr. Smith, has declined from CN $12,000 a
                                liang (1.00471 oz) to CN $9,000 since the announcement of the
                                government’s gold sale plan. <hi rend="italic">End of

                        <p>Professor Chao’s statement that sale of gold can be only a palliative and
                            must be accompanied by other measures to control prices is in agreement
                            with opinions of officials of the Ministry of Finance. His assumption
                            that the gold will be sold through the Central Bank does not appear to
                            be well founded, as Ministry of Finance officials have privately stated
                            that, while it has not been decided how the gold will be sold, it
                            definitely will not be sold through the government banks. He points to a
                            real danger in his caution against permitting speculators to borrow from
                            the Central Bank against gold, as they already do against U. S. dollar
                            savings certificates.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Buck’s contention that the market for gold is limited and that its
                            purchasing power will decline still further if large quantities are
                            offered for sale appears to be well founded. Many writers in local
                            periodicals proceed on the assumption that it would be possible to sell
                            5,700,000 ounces of gold to the public in a short period at CN $10,000
                            an ounce. It is notable that gold prices in centers near Japanese
                            occupied territory, such as Kweilin and Loyang, have continued firm
                            despite the announcement of the government’s plan, whereas in interior
                            centers they have declined materially.</p>

                        <p>2231. To Secretary of the Treasury from Adler. Raised question with Dr.
                            Kung in accordance with your instructions in conversation yesterday. He
                            replied that missionaries had been receiving 30 to 1 for missionary
                            expenditures since May 1 and that all famine relief expenditures had
                            been receiving 40 to 1 from same date. He was in <pb n="455" xml:id="pg_455" facs="0465"/>course of negotiating with foreign
                            missionary philanthropic and cultural organizations about further
                            adjustment in rate they receive (re your 1474, October 13).</p>
                        <p>Above confirmed by reliable source according to which missionaries had
                            been receiving 40 for famine relief expenditures. According to same
                            source, Dr. Kung will probably give above organizations 40 for all their
                            expenditures in China. [Adler.]</p>

                                think of me and I am delighted to have that delicious Chinese
                                tea—especially because I am more and more substituting tea for
                                coffee.</p>
                            <p>Our visit here in Cairo with the Generalissimo and Madame Chiang has
                                been not only very delightful but it has been a true success. It is
                                the beginning of many such conferences, I hope. They have spoken to
                                me in regard to the inflation problem and when they get back to
                                Chungking they will speak with you in regard to a suggestion which I
                                have made. I have not, of course, had a chance to talk with the
                                Secretary of the Treasury about it but I will do so just as soon as
                                I get home.</p>
                            <p>I do hope that I shall have the pleasure of seeing you one of these
                                days very soon. My warm regards,</p>

                        <p>2335. For account of course of prices September, October, see section 1,
                            paragraph 1 of my 2297, of December l.<note n="72" xml:id="d387fn72">Not
                                printed.</note> Ambassador Wei’s statement like report of Mark
                            Twain’s death. True that prices of a few individual commodities fell in
                            this period due to a number of factors, but this fall was insufficient
                            to reverse upward trend. While preliminary retail price data for
                            Chungking [in] November also reveal maintenance of comparatively gradual
                            upward trend, price of only one commodity, tea, actually declined. Most
                            competent observers believe that upward trend of prices will become more
                            marked before Chinese New Year.</p>
                        <p>From Adler for Secretary of Treasury. Clear that largely psychological
                            beneficial effects of Chinese Government purchase of gold have already
                            worked themselves out and that only further sales to public on a
                            significant scale would yield additional results. (Re your 1731,
                            December 2.) In this connection Kung, in a recent conversation, repeated
                            that Chinese Government would probably call a halt to large scale
                            importation of gold owing to high cost of insurance and transportation
                            and sell gold certificates instead. (Cf. end of paragraph 3, of my 2228,
                            November 24.<note n="72" xml:id="d387fn1">Not printed.</note>) Safe to
                            predict that sale of claims on gold would neither find as ready a market
                            nor yield as high a return per unit as would sale of gold itself.</p>

                                the renewal or at most the revision of the existing agreement. I am
                                reliably informed that Dr. Kung has frequently asserted that the
                                existing agreement was not a good one and has particularly objected
                                to the first sentence of paragraph 9 of the agreement according to
                                which you can terminate the agreement unilaterally at 30 days’
                                notice. While he himself has on several occasions mentioned that he
                                wished to retain foreign representatives on the Board, in more
                                nationalistic circles, their presence on the Board is considered a
                                derogation of Chinese sovereignty. Dr. Kung informed me yesterday
                                that if negotiations for a new agreement are initiated, China will
                                ask for terms of <pb n="458" xml:id="pg_458" facs="0468"/>repayment
                                identical with or similar to those of the Lend-Lease

                            <item>There is reason to believe that Dr. Kung is partly actuated by
                                personal motives in his desire to negotiate a new agreement.
                                Apparently Dr. T. V. Soong<note n="79" xml:id="d388fn79">Chinese
                                    Minister for Foreign Affairs since December 1941.</note>
                                recommended that the 1941 Agreement be renewed, but Dr. Kung wishes
                                to demonstrate that he can obtain a better agreement than could Dr.
                                T. V. Soong, and one which moreover will be free from any of the
                                “stigmas” of the unequal treaties. Another possible factor is the
                                desire to find a job for T. L. Soong<note n="80" xml:id="d388fn80">Brother of T. V. Soong.</note> who has just been appointed a

                                Transportation Company which monopolized traffic on the Burma Road.
                                If such a job were given him, he would presumably replace K. P. Chen

                                should be preserved in essentially its present form. [Adler.]</item>

                            <item>Treasury’s position on the extension of the 1941 Agreement is that
                                if China wishes to renew the 1941 Agreement, the Treasury will be
                                glad to give favorable consideration to a request to this effect. It
                                seems to us that the present form of the Agreement has worked out as
                                satisfactorily as could be expected under existing conditions.
                                However, any question as to whether the Agreement should be renewed

                            the vicious stage and that the President has asked him what the Chinese
                            Government was doing about it.</p>
                        <p>As a result of the President’s observations, the Generalissimo discussed
                            with Kung possible steps to counteract the inflation. Generalissimo
                            raised the possibility of China’s buying U. S. dollars 300 million of
                            gold from the Treasury with the unused portion of the American U. S.

                            informed me that he had told the Generalissimo that U. S. dollars 300
                            million of gold was too much and that China should ask for U. S. dollars
                            200 million. He was therefore asking me to sound you out on feasibility
                            of your selling U. S. dollars 200 million of gold to China, China to
                            purchase the gold out of unused portion of the U. S. dollars one-half
                            billion loan and the gold to be gradually transported to China and sold
                            to the Chinese public.</p>
                        <p>Kung said that from viewpoint of Chinese Government sale of gold to the
                            public had several advantages over sale of savings certificates: <list>

                            <item>On June 29 Dr. Kuo Ping-wen and Mr. Hsi Te-mou approached the
                                Treasury with regard to the revision of the 1941 Agreement. They
                                indicated to the Treasury that they had been informed by Dr. Kung
                                that Dr. Kung wished to place the Agreement on a Lend-Lease basis
                                and indicated that this probably meant advancing funds to China on a
                                Lend-Lease basis. They were informed that the Treasury could not use
                                any part of the U. S. Stabilization Fund in this manner.</item>

                            <item>On July 6 Dr. Kuo Ping-wen and Mr. Hsi Te-mou again called at the
                                Treasury to say that they had now been informed by Dr. Kung that Dr.
                                Kung wished the 1941 Agreement to be revised in accordance with the
                                spirit and principles of Lend-Lease. They indicated that this
                                probably meant that Dr. Kung wished to revise such provisions in the
                                Agreement which the Chinese felt were not in accord with the spirit
                                of complete equality such as the provision of Paragraph 9 of the
                                Agreement which provides that the Secretary can unilaterally
                                terminate the Agreement at 30 days’ notice. Dr. Kuo and Mr. Hsi also
                                indicated that Dr. Kung’s reference to spirit of Lend-Lease might
                                include objection to the present provision in the Agreement for
                                payment of interest. The Treasury indicated to them that the funds
                                provided under a stabilization agreement could not be advanced on
                                the same basis as Lend-Lease aid but that the Treasury would be
                                willing to consider revisions in the Agreement which Dr. Kung might
                                wish to suggest which are compatible with our stabilization

                            <item>For your information there is given herewith some of the
                                background in Washington to the Chinese request. When in Washington,
                                Madame Chiang Kai-shek raised with Secretary Morgenthau the
                                possibility of China’s purchasing very large amounts of gold from
                                the United States to be imported into China for sale to the public
                                as a means of helping to check inflation. The Secretary indicated to
                                her that the Treasury was willing to give the matter maximum
                                consideration. As a result of further discussions, in which Dr. Kuo
                                and Mr. Hsi represented the Government of China, the Treasury is
                                probably prepared to acquiesce in principle to the Chinese request.
                                The details, however, have not as yet been worked out and no
                                definitive decision has been made.<note n="86" xml:id="d395fn86">For

                        <p>1211. State Department’s 882, July 9, part I. In accordance with your
                            suggestion, [I] took the opportunity during a call on Dr. Kung on the
                            15th to have an informal discussion with him to make sure that he fully
                            understands the Treasury position with respect to revision of 1941
                            Agreement. He gave the impression—I think deliberately—that China was
                            not particularly anxious to have a stabilization loan; presumably this
                            is largely jockeying for bargaining position. At the same time he
                            intimated that China would ask for certain specific changes in 1941
                            Agreement without indicating what they would be.</p>

                            <item>Learn from reliable sources that Dr. Kung called a meeting of
                                monetary experts early in week to consider what revisions China
                                should propose to 1941 Agreement. Consensus of meeting favored
                                maintenance of Board. Dr. Kung suggested that China should propose
                                only a few revisions, one [<hi rend="italic">none?</hi>] of them
                                drastic. There is strong ground for believing that Kung’s attitude
                                is due to his desire to obtain Treasury consent to proposed purchase
                                of gold. For your information, Kung does not realize that 1941
                                Agreement has elapsed.</item>

                                1941 Agreement subject to specific revisions it had been preparing
                                for your consideration. Have submitted my resignation as of August

                        <p>1392. For Secretary [of] Treasury from Adler. TF–150. Have just received
                            a reply to my letter of August 2 to Dr. Kung in which I formally
                            submitted my resignation. Dr. Kung neither accepts nor rejects my
                            resignation but writes he has cabled Chinese representatives in
                            Washington asking them to ascertain Treasury’s views with respect to
                            bearing of your instructions to me upon possible negotiation of an
                            altered agreement and also to proposed international monetary
                            arrangements. He concluded that he will communicate with me further
                            after receiving a reply to this inquiry. [Adler.]</p>

                        <p>1088. From Secretary of the Treasury for Adler. Your 1373, August 4, and
                            TF–150, August 6. Please tell Dr. Kung that:</p>
                        <p>The reason the Treasury instructed Mr. Adler to submit his resignation is
                            that, since no request was received for the renewal of the 1940 [<hi rend="italic">1941</hi>] agreement as provided in paragraph 9
                            thereof, the agreement had lapsed. We have just been informed by Dr. Kuo
                            and Mr. Hsi that, as the Ministry of Finance is now considering
                            revisions of the 1941 agreement for submittal to the Treasury, Dr. Kung
                            wishes Mr. Adler to withdraw his resignation. In view of this the
                            Treasury is asking Mr. Adler to withdraw his resignation temporarily.

                            confidentially Chairman some 10 days ago submitted his resignation,
                            which Dr. Kung rejected. Chairman, who appears determined to quit, has
                            again submitted resignation, though agreeing to carry on until successor
                            is appointed. While stated ground for resignation is health, his actual
                            grounds are undercurrent of friction with Dr. Kung and dissatisfaction
                            with Board’s lack of power. [Adler.]</p>

                            resignation has not been accepted, that he again told Dr. Kung he would
                            carry on until successor is named and that he accordingly expects to
                            continue in the post for some time. He stated also that question of
                            revision continues to be discussed and he intimated that he was strongly
                            opposing revision, including any revision which would eliminate foreign
                            members of the Board. He mentioned several times that the “Board has no

                            has been no change in the situation and that the Ministry of Finance is
                            awaiting “the American reply” to suggestions in regard to revision of
                            the Stabilization Agreement sent some time ago by Kung to Hsi Te-mou.
                            Please inform Treasury.</p>

                        <p>1801. Embassy’s 1624, September 2. We are informed by a reliable
                            authoritative source that pending definitive action in regard to the
                            Stabilization Board, the Board’s activities have deteriorated to
                            practically nothing as the Board itself does not know what its status is
                            and lacks any real power. According to this source, who is very close to
                            the chairman, K. P. Chen will probably continue as chairman until the
                            Board in its present form “is shelved and Chen is shelved with it.”</p>

                        <p>At a meeting called by the Treasury Department on October 6, Mr. White
                            brought up the question of the renewal with China of the Stabilization
                            Agreement of 1941.</p>
                        <pb n="469" xml:id="pg_469" facs="0479"/>
                        <p>Mr. White stated that the Chinese Government about two months ago had
                            indicated through Dr. TV V. Soong, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was
                            in Washington at the time, a desire to revise the Stabilization
                            Agreement of 1941 which has expired. About three weeks ago the Chinese
                            had finally submitted specific proposals indicating the manner in which
                            they desire the agreement revised. The most important proposal made by
                            the Chinese was that the 1941 rate of exchange between Chinese yuan and
                            U. S. currency should continue to govern the revised agreement. Mr.
                            White stated that the Treasury which was responsible to Congress for the
                            utilization of the American portion of the Stabilization Fund, amounting
                            to $50,000,000, was not prepared to conclude an agreement on the basis
                            of the 1941 rate of exchange which at the present time has little
                            relation to the actual value of Chinese currency. He remarked that as we
                            all knew Chinese currency had depreciated rapidly during the past year.
                            Mr. White said that the Treasury was therefore inclined to “stall” and
                            to indicate to the Chinese merely that this question was under
                            consideration. Mr. White said the Treasury desired to know, however,
                            whether in the opinion of the State Department there were any important
                            political reasons or considerations which would make it inadvisable for
                            the Treasury to pursue the policy indicated.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine inquired what economic issues were involved in the renewal
                            of the agreement on the basis of the 1941 rate of exchange. Mr. White
                            replied that the Treasury felt renewal on such a basis was, so far as
                            the United States was concerned, economically and financially unsound
                            and that the Treasury did not believe further appropriations for this
                            purpose on the basis of the 1941 rate would receive Congressional
                            approval.</p>
                        <p>There ensued some discussion in regard to the possible connection between
                            this matter and the conclusion of a reverse Lend-Lease agreement<note n="88" xml:id="d408fn88">For correspondence on this subject, see
                                    <ref target="#pg_515">pp. 515</ref> ff.</note> with the Chinese.
                            Mr. White indicated that the absence of a stabilization agreement with
                            the Chinese Government, fixing a specific rate of exchange between
                            Chinese yuan and U. S. currency, would eliminate certain technical
                            difficulties which would otherwise confront the Treasury in a reverse
                            Lend-Lease agreement such as contemplated. Mr. White said he thought
                            that the Treasury’s lack of interest in a renewal of the Stabilization
                            Agreement on the old basis might cause the Chinese Government to take
                            favorable action in regard to reverse Lend-Lease. He also remarked that
                            in the absence of a stabilization agreement fixing the rate of exchange
                            between Chinese yuan and U. S. currency, there would be no legal
                            obligations, in so far as our official personnel in China was concerned,
                            to refrain from use of the “black market” if they should choose to do
                            so.</p>
                        <pb n="470" xml:id="pg_470" facs="0480"/>
                        <p>Mr. Ballantine stated that he would bring this matter to the attention of
                            interested officers of the Department and that he would expect to
                            communicate informally to Mr. White our reactions to the Treasury’s
                            proposed course as soon as possible. Mr. White said Treasury would of
                            course keep the Department fully informed of any developments.</p>

                                <item>Information received by the Department from Chungking would
                                    indicate that this matter is not one of pressing concern to the
                                    Chinese authorities. The fact that the Chinese were slow in
                                    taking any action when the agreement expired, that the Chinese
                                    requested a revision of the agreement on the basis of the 1941
                                    rate of exchange which they know is unrealistic and not likely
                                    to be viewed favorably by the Treasury, would tend to confirm
                                    the impression that this matter is not of serious concern to the
                                    Chinese Government. It is not believed, therefore, that failure
                                    of the Treasury Department to proceed immediately with
                                    negotiations regarding this matter would have any adverse
                                    political repercussions or affect the very friendly relations
                                    now existing between China and the United States. Our military
                                    and material aid to China which is slowly increasing will in no
                                    way be affected.</item>

                                <item>In as much as the Stabilization Agreement of 1941 merely
                                    stabilized and fixed the rate of exchange between Chinese yuan
                                    and U. S. currency, it had little effect on the inflationary
                                    situation which has steadily deteriorated. It is believed that
                                    the conclusion of a revised or new stabilization agreement would
                                    have equally little effect on the present financial situation in

                                    will perhaps induce them to give favorable consideration to the
                                    conclusion of a reverse Lend-Lease agreement. The conclusion of
                                    a reverse Lend-Lease agreement is all the more important to our
                                    military and official personnel in China, whose difficulties

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Feis</hi>: I talked to Mr. Friedman at Treasury
                            and he said that the Chinese have not yet submitted specific proposals
                            for revision of the 1941 “Stabilization Agreement” in writing. Chinese
                            representatives submitted some proposals orally to Harry White, in
                            Friedman’s presence. Friedman assured me that the proposed changes were
                            on “minor points”, e. g. giving the right of termination to both parties
                            etc. Contrary to Mr. Stanton’s report on Mr. White’s statement during
                            the conversation of October 6, to the effect that “the most important
                            proposal made by the Chinese was that the 1941 rate of exchange …<note n="92" xml:id="d411fn92">Omission indicated in the original.</note>
                            should continue to govern the revised agreement,” Mr. Friedman said that
                            it was his impression that the Chinese did not discuss exchange rates
                            specifically, though probably their silence on this point implied that
                            they did not contemplate any change in the 1941 rate.</p>
                        <pb n="472" xml:id="pg_472" facs="0482"/>
                        <p>Until the Chinese submit written proposals, they can hardly be said to be
                            actively interested in renewal, and this Government probably need not
                            feel called upon to take the initiative. Due to China’s present trade
                            isolation, the stabilization board has been inactive, and a debate over
                            exchange rates at this time would be highly academic. It would seem
                            advisable to wait until the need for stabilization operations arises,
                            and then draw up a new arrangement meeting the requirements of the
                            situation. Arrangements for dollar loans and gold sales are more
                            appropriate means for meeting China’s present financial needs, while the
                            existence of an exchange stabilization arrangement merely gives a false
                            appearance of recognition and support to the unrealistic official
                            exchange rate established by the Central Government, and handicaps our
                            negotiations for reciprocal lend-lease and fairer conversion rates on
                            diplomatic salaries and charitable remittances.<note n="93" xml:id="d411fn93">Marginal notation by Mr. Feis with respect to the

                            <item>Mr. T. L. Soong and Mr. Hsi Te-mou have been informed that the
                                Treasury feels that the 1941 Agreement should not be renewed under
                                present circumstances and that you are being asked to resign from
                                the Stabilization Board. They were told that it is the Treasury’s
                                feeling that a stabilization agreement should not be entered into on
                                    <pb n="473" xml:id="pg_473" facs="0483"/>the basis of the
                                present exchange rate and that China does not at this time need the
                                financial assistance. If it so desires, China could raise the
                                question of a new agreement with the Treasury at some future
                                time.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>It was therefore the Treasury’s intention to instruct you to
                                submit your resignation to Dr. Kung as of December 31, this giving
                                you some time to be of assistance to the Board. However, Mr. Hsi
                                Te-mou has requested the Treasury not to ask you to resign at this
                                time but instead to wait a few weeks until he shall have received
                                from Dr. Kung a reply regarding the Treasury’s position. You will
                                therefore not submit your resignation at this time. The feeling
                                here, however, is that the Treasury is unlikely to change its views
                                regarding your resignation. It is anxious that the financial
                                position of the Board, when you leave it, should be such that it
                                will be impossible to suggest that inability of the Board to meet
                                its obligations was the reason the American member resigned.
                                Information regarding this is requested. [Morgenthau.]</item>

                        <p>Sir George Sansom had called on Mr. Hornbeck in connection with several
                            matters other than the topic under reference. When Sir George raised the
                            question of the Stabilization Board Mr. Hornbeck, who at about that time
                            was called to the Secretary’s office, referred Sir George to Messrs.
                            Ballantine and Hiss.</p>
                        <p>Sir George said that instructions had been received from the British
                            Foreign Office to mention to the Department of State the view of the
                            Foreign Office that the continuance of the Stabilization Board on a
                            three-power basis had political aspects which the Foreign Office
                            considered of some importance.</p>
                        <p>In the course of a general informal discussion of the status of the
                            Stabilization Board Messrs. Ballantine and Hiss stated that in their
                            opinion, speaking personally and not officially, the matter from a
                            political point of view was not of very great moment. Sir George said
                            that he did not perceive any very great political issue but that he was
                            not sure just what the Foreign Office had in mind. Messrs. Ballantine
                            and Hiss suggested that Sir George might wish to talk directly with Dr.
                            White of the Treasury Department in order to be sure that he had full
                            understanding of the Treasury’s position in the matter. Sir George
                            replied that Sir David Waley, the British Treasury’s representative in
                            Washington, had talked with Dr. White of <pb n="475" xml:id="pg_475" facs="0485"/>the Treasury and said that he could do no more. Sir
                            George indicated that he himself would be reluctant to talk the matter
                            over with Dr. White in view of his own lack of knowledge of the details
                            of the matter and in view of the fact that Sir David who was an expert
                            on such matters had not accomplished anything.</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Ballantine and Hiss pointed out that so far as they knew the
                            Treasury had at no time taken any rigid attitude with the Chinese on
                            this matter and that the door was always open to the Chinese to suggest
                            some new approach to the matter. It was pointed out to Sir George that
                            the Stabilization Board is not in position at present to accomplish very
                            much, that the American-Chinese Stabilization Agreement has expired and
                            that the Chinese have not proposed any renewal of the agreement which
                            seemed feasible to the Treasury Department. In the absence of any
                            indication that the Chinese were sufficiently desirous of continuing the
                            Board to offer to consider any revision of the agreement so as to make
                            it more acceptable to us, it would seem that it would place us in an
                            awkward position to express a desire to continue representation on the
                            Board. Sir George was told that Mr. Adler continues to remain in
                            Chungking and that we are not aware of any decision to recall him. It
                            was also pointed out to Sir George that it may be somewhat anomalous for
                            this Government, under the circumstances, to continue participation in
                            an agency whose primary duty is to stabilize Chinese currency at the
                            existing official rate of twenty to one when at the same time, as Sir
                            George knew, this Government is expressing directly and indirectly the
                            view that the official rate results in very considerable hardships to
                            American official personnel in China and even interferes with the full
                            conduct of our military effort in China.</p>
                        <p>Sir George seemed inclined to drop the matter and, in any event, it would
                            appear that no further action is called for unless the British Embassy
                            take some further initiative in the matter.</p>

                        <p>2361. For the President and the Secretary and Under Secretary.</p>
                        <p>1. The Embassy has recently had several intimations that China
                                    proposes soon to ask the United States for another substantial
                                    political loan.</p>
                                <p>We here perceive no sound basis, political or economic, for
                                    supporting any such loan proposal at this time.</p>
                                <p>China does not lack substantial United States dollar resources,
                                    Government and private. Including the [$]200,000,000 included
                                    for the purchase of American gold, Government balances in the
                                    United States are believed to be in excess of [$]300,000,000 and
                                    to be mounting very substantially each month. Private holdings
                                    are estimated at between 4 and 500,000,000 [dollars].</p>
                                <p>It is not feasible for China to mobilize her United States dollar
                                    resources to combat internal inflation, and the manner in which

                                    handled. Further, China has not yet begun to use the British
                                    sterling credit granted at the same time as the American
                                    loan.</p>
                                <p>Even if the Burma Road is re-opened, China has adequate resources
                                    to finance purchase of such commercial goods as could be
                                    permitted to be brought in. While the war continues, the Burma
                                        <pb n="477" xml:id="pg_477" facs="0487"/>Road would need to

                                <p>From the political angle, there is now no need for any further

                                    logistics of the military situation in the China theater could
                                    expect any substantial major military effort by China against
                                    Japan. But there is nevertheless a great deal that China can and
                                    should do but is not doing, within the scope of Chinese
                                    resources and ability, to help herself and thus further the war

                                    [pressure?] in political quarters to impress upon China the
                                    necessity of getting on with such works as the construction of
                                    new air fields, construction and improvement of roads for
                                    military transport and communication purposes, etc.
                                    Investigation has shown that Chinese budgets for such purposes
                                    have been cut and have only been restored under pressure and
                                    that funds appropriated have been long delayed in being issued
                                    by the Treasury, thus delaying the work. Quiet confidential
                                    investigation in assistance to our Army has disclosed
                                    indications of extensive corruption, jealousies, delays and
                                    sabotage of honest effort.</p>
                                <p>Our Army is paying out large sums monthly in financing airfield
                                    installations, paying transportation charges, etc. These
                                    payments run to 20 or more million American dollars monthly and
                                    are constantly rising. Our costs are stated to be from 8 to 10
                                    times those which would be incurred in the United States for
                                    similar facilities and services due to Chinese insistence on
                                    maintaining a fantastically arbitrary exchange rate for Chinese
                                    dollars against United States dollars. With the runaway
                                    inflation in China, prices of commodities and services have
                                    increased 16 to 18,000 percent (160 to 180 times) over 1937
                                    levels and are continuing to increase at a rate of about 10
                                    percent monthly. But the Chinese dollar has been pegged at 5
                                    cents United States currency against a prewar rate of 33 cents.
                                    In relation to price levels and prewar exchange rates the
                                    Chinese dollar should not now be worth more than one half cent
                                    to one cent. Proposals made for some exchange adjustment or
                                    arrangements under reverse Lend-Lease have been evaded. The army
                                    continues its heavy and increasing monthly expenditures at the
                                    arbitrary rate and China meanwhile is quietly building up a
                                    substantial United States dollar reserve at our expense.</p>
                                <p>Some may argue that in her present deplorable economic position
                                    China is unable to assist the United States financially in our
                                    war <pb n="479" xml:id="pg_479" facs="0489"/>expenditures in
                                    this country. I do not suggest that China should bear such
                                    expenses but I suggest that China should not exploit the United
                                    States in the matter. China should be encouraged to realize that
                                    it is blessed to give as well as to receive and that by helping
                                    us she will be helping herself.</p>
                                <p>In the face of all the foregoing I am of opinion that no further
                                    American political loan to China can be justified at this
                                    time.</p>
                            <p>3. I am convinced that there should be a quiet but persistent forming
                                of our attitude toward China, that it should be emphasized that
                                mutual benefit is requisite in all our inter-governmental
                                arrangements and exchanges, that Chinese should be impressed with
                                the necessity of an all out effort within the limits of her
                                resources and ability toward winning the war, toward helping herself
                                by helping us in our war effort in the China theater, and that a
                                more realistic and equitable attitude must be insisted upon from
                                China in reference to the exchange financing of our American
                                expenditures for military and Government purposes in this
                                theater.</p>
                            <p>4. On the subject of Chinese tendency toward a closed economy in the
                                postwar period [I] strongly recommend that we should without further
                                delay quietly put China on notice as to our expectations before she
                                adopts policies which for reasons of oriental face she may not later
                                be willing to alter, by opening negotiations for our commercial
                                treaty, advancing our proposals regarding the treatment of American
                                commerce and American financial and industrial interests,
                                emphasizing the necessity for mutual consideration and mutual
                                benefit and insisting that Americans and American interests in China
                                all enjoy rights and privileges comparable to those enjoyed by
                                Chinese in the United States.</p>

                            <p>You have spoken of the request of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek for
                                an additional $1 billion of financial aid to China to be used to
                                help control inflation and for postwar reconstruction.</p>

                            <p>The facts regarding inflation in China and the possibility of its
                                control through the use of dollar resources are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Inflation in China, as you well know, arises from the grave
                                inadequacy of production for war needs and essential civilian
                                consumption. Supplies have been drastically reduced by enemy
                                occupation and the cutting off of imports except the small amounts
                                that come by air or are smuggled from occupied territory.</p>
                            <p>The Chinese Government cannot collect sufficient taxes or borrow from
                                the people in adequate amounts. As a consequence, the Government has
                                been issuing 3.5 billion yuan a month, twice the rate of a year
                                ago.</p>
                            <p>The official exchange rate for yuan is now 5 cents; before China
                                entered the war it was 30 cents. The open market rate for yuan in U.
                                S. paper currency is one cent and in terms of gold one-third of a
                                cent.</p>
                            <p>You have suggested the possibility of our selling dollar currency for
                                yuan to be resold to China after the war at no profit to us. No
                                doubt something could be done to alleviate inflation through the
                                sale of gold or dollar currency in China. I have received the
                                following message from Dr. Kung<note n="6" xml:id="d419fn6">H. H.

                                    <p>“You will be pleased to hear that the recent gold shipment is
                                        one of the outstanding factors contributing to the
                                        strengthening of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi>, because people
                                        believe that the arrival of gold has increased the much
                                        needed reserve of our currency, thereby influencing the
                                        stability of prices. The action of the United States
                                        Government re-affirms to the Chinese people that, despite
                                        difficulties arising from the blockade and the cumulative
                                        effects of over six years of war against the invasion, China
                                        has a powerful friend desirous of strengthening China’s
                                        economy as conditions permit.”</p>

                                the only real hope of controlling inflation is by getting more goods

                            <p>China has tried two similar monetary remedies for alleviating

                                <item>The Chinese Government issued and sold dollar securities for
                                    yuan, setting aside $200 million of the aid granted by this
                                    country for the redemption of the securities. (These securities
                                    were sold at exorbitant profit to the buyers. For instance, a
                                    person holding $100 in U. S. currency could have quadrupled his
                                    money in less than two years by selling the currency for yuan on
                                    the open market and buying the dollar securities issued by the
                                    Chinese Government.) I believe that the program made no
                                    significant contribution to the control of inflation.</item>

                                <item>The Chinese Government has recently been selling gold at a
                                    price in yuan equivalent to $550 an ounce, about fifteen times
                                    the official rate. We have shipped to China more than $10
                                    million of gold and they have sold about $2 million of gold for
                                    yuan. This program has not been tried sufficiently to warrant
                                    any definite conclusion as to its possible effect.</item>
                            </list>
                            <p>China now has $460 million of unpledged funds in the United States
                                and is getting about $20 million a month as a result of our
                                expenditures. China could use these funds in selling gold or dollar
                                assets for yuan, although in my opinion such schemes in the past
                                have had little effect except to give additional profits to
                                insiders, speculators and hoarders and dissipate foreign exchange
                                resources that could be better used by China for reconstruction.</p>
                            <p>Under the circumstances, a loan to China for these purposes could not
                                be justified by the results that have been obtained. It is my
                                opinion that a loan is unnecessary at this time and would be
                                undesirable from the point of view of China and the United States.
                                Large expenditures on ineffective measures for controlling inflation
                                in China would be an unwise use of her borrowing capacity which
                                should be reserved for productive uses in other ways. On
                                reconstruction, it is too soon for us to know the best use or the
                                best form of the aid we might give to China.</p>

                            <p>For the past five years I have had a deep admiration for the valiant
                                fight that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chiang

                                        of yuan with gold or dollar currency at whatever price we
                                        can get them for in the open market. This is equal to more

                                        month to about $12 million. At the present price for gold in

                        <p>2478. At their request I called with Atcheson<note n="7" xml:id="d420fn7">George Atcheson, Jr., Counselor of Embassy in China.</note> on
                            President and Madame Chiang last evening. Wang Chung-hui<note n="8" xml:id="d420fn8">Secretary General of the Chinese Supreme National

                            but no others. Chiang asked significantly whether I had recently
                            received any telegrams. I replied none of importance. He then inquired
                            what I thought of situation in China, especially economic situation, and
                            said he would be glad to receive my advice and to hear any plan I might
                            propose. He spoke of seriousness of economic conditions, repeated
                            suggestion that I offer any plan for improvement; and went on to say
                            that the coming year will be most critical in China and that economic
                            collapse has so far been avoided because of the faith of Chinese people
                            in the national currency. He said it is essential that the Burma Road be
                            opened soon and that so long as Burma Road remains closed China’s
                            desperate economic condition makes it necessary to support value of
                            Chinese currency and maintain the exchange rate.</p>
                        <p>He inquired whether I had studied problem of China’s financial
                            difficulties. I replied that we endeavor to follow financial situation
                            with such information as is available and that one aspect, from the
                            American point of view, which had of late given me much concern was the
                            effect of the exchange rate on American official expenditures to service
                            the military forces with which we are aiding China; those expenditures
                            are now reaching heavy figures and, converted at the <pb n="483" xml:id="pg_483" facs="0493"/>artificial exchange rate, are costing
                            our Government 20 or more million XL S. dollars monthly which, while
                            beneficial to China in building up currency reserve in XL S. represent
                            costs to XL S. from 8 to 10 times what we should have to pay in America
                            or anywhere else for comparable facilities and services, such as
                            urgently needed advance air base facilities for our forces. I expressed
                            concern that this becoming known in the XL S. might lead to serious
                            criticism that the American Army and Government are being exploited and
                            such criticism would work to the harm of China as well as to the injury
                            of our war effort in this country.</p>
                        <p>Chiang indicated with firmness that exchange rate for Chinese dollars
                            cannot be changed. I said I fully appreciated his attitude on that
                            question but suggested that other proposals looking to solution of the
                            problem, such as reverse Lend-Lease or suggestion Morgenthau had made to
                            Kung regarding sale of gold, might be adopted without necessitating a
                            change in exchange rate. Mme. Chiang said that Chinese Government’s
                            efforts to sell gold had been a failure; there was no market for gold.
                            Chiang said he had been studying the matter) of reverse Lend-Lease, that
                            he and Kung were much worried over whole financial situation, that it is
                            impossible to alter exchange rate and imperative that value of national
                            currency be supported. He requested me to see Kung again and, just
                            before retiring from the room in his customary way, asked with a show of
                            some emphasis and exasperation that I inform our military and Treasury
                            people that failure to support China’s currency would result in both
                            economic and military collapse of China.</p>
                        <p>During conversation Mme. Chiang indicated that Chiang’s views in regard
                            to seriousness of the situation had been presented to the President at
                            Cairo. After Chiang’s departure she spoke with great emphasis of China’s
                            economic difficulties, said somewhat bitterly that China was paying
                            about 200 Chinese dollars daily for maintaining every American soldier
                            in China, indicated that as our forces increase the cost would become
                            unbearable and added that it was becoming more and more impossible to
                            find enough cows, pigs and chickens to feed American troops (to
                            supplement the quantities of supplies we ourselves ship in). She said
                            that it was absolutely essential that Chinese currency receive
                            sufficient backing.</p>
                        <p>(2) I am of the opinion that stage had been set last evening for
                                    seeking State Department support for request for further
                                    American loan and that such request was not made because of the
                                    diversion to subject of our military expenditures. Stilwell
                                    informed me December 20 that Chiang had asked for a billion
                                    dollar loan<note n="9" xml:id="d420fn9">For President

                                    and no more. I assume request was made in connection with
                                    military discussions and through military channels.</p>
                                <p>It is unfortunate that Embassy is not kept fully informed of what
                                    transpires in Sino-American relations.</p>
                                <p>Embassy’s opinion regarding further loan to China at this time
                                    was carefully set out in my 2361, December 9. I am strongly of
                                    opinion that we should stand firm on the subject at this
                                    time.</p>
                            <p>(3) I have no information regarding military plans for a Burma
                                    campaign designed to restore land transportation to China which
                                    experts here consider the only possible measure for amelioration
                                    of fantastic economic situation. I am prepared to believe that
                                    while the masses of the people are not concerned by the foreign
                                    exchange rate, any substantial change therein would be availed
                                    of by hoarders and speculators still further to accelerate
                                    rising prices.</p>
                                <p>Chinese Government has actually done nothing substantial to seek
                                    out and deal with these hoarders and speculators. I believe,
                                    however, that China has substantial U.S. currency reserves at
                                    this time and that reasonable measure to meet the situation
                                    affecting our military expenditures in China might be taken
                                    without reference to Exchange rate as such, probably within the
                                    structure of reverse Lend-Lease and sale of gold.</p>
                                <p>While I do not pretend to pass judgment in military matters, I
                                    should emphasize what we have previously and repeatedly
                                    reported: that the military and economic situations in China are
                                    so fast deteriorating that early military measures to reopen the
                                    Burma Road and restore land transport to China are imperative to
                                    prevent collapse of this country in due course. An American loan
                                    will not help the economic situation in China at this time;
                                    extensive successful military operations alone will do
                                so.</p>

                            Secretary of State of December 20, and Mr. Gauss’ “Strictly Confidential

                                original.</note> Not for Distribution” telegram 2361, December 9, 3
                            p.m.: all bearing on the subject of an intimated request by the Chinese
                            Government for a loan by the United States Government of
                            $1,000,000,000.</p>
                        <pb n="485" xml:id="pg_485" facs="0495"/>
                        <p>The indications are that the Chinese Government has applied to this
                            Government for a loan of $1,000,000,000, and this memorandum will be
                            posited on an assumption that such is the fact.</p>
                        <p>The problem which is thus presented is one of very wide and very serious
                            import. It is important in economic, in political and in psychological
                            aspects. It calls for most careful consideration both as regards the
                            substance of the decision at which this Government may arrive and as
                            regards the handling of the decision in the field of diplomatic action.
                            The economic features of the question presented are of substantial
                            importance, but comparatively speaking the political and psychological
                            features are capable of being, from the long-swing point of view, of
                            considerably greater ultimate consequence.</p>
                        <p>In its telegram of December 9, the Embassy at Chungking, in anticipation,
                            stated: “We here perceive no sound basis, political or economic, for
                            supporting any such loan proposal at this time”; and the Embassy
                            expressed itself vigorously and categorically in support of that view as
                            regarded political and psychological considerations reflective of its
                            appraisal of the present situation within China. In his memorandum for
                            the President of December 18, the Secretary of the Treasury discussed
                            the question from the economic point of view and, in the light
                            especially of experience of recent years, advanced the opinion “that a
                            loan is unnecessary at this time and would be undesirable from the point
                            of view of China and the United States.”</p>
                        <p>In its telegram of December 23, the Embassy at Chungking, reporting on a
                            conversation with President Chiang and Madame Chiang, reaffirms the
                            position which it took in its telegram of December 9, expresses the
                            opinion that “An American loan will not help the economic situation in
                            China at this time”, and emphasizes the view that “extensive successful
                            military operations alone will do so.”</p>
                        <p>There are indications that the subject of this loan was broached by
                            Chiang at the Cairo Conference. There have been heard rumors to the
                            effect that Chiang was given encouragement to believe that the requests
                            by China for such a loan would meet with favorable response. There are
                            indications, also, that Chiang strongly urged that a campaign for the
                            reopening of the Burma Road be embarked upon at once; and rumors have
                            been heard and have been seen in print to the effect that Chiang was
                            told that this could not be done. Whatever the facts may be so far as
                            the Cairo Conference is concerned, China’s desire for a loan has
                            apparently been formally expressed and operations for the reopening of
                            the Burma Road have not been embarked upon.</p>
                        <p>Granting that a loan by the United States to China at this time, if made,
                            could not be defended and would not be justified on economic grounds,
                            and accepting at face value—for purposes of this discussion—the <pb n="486" xml:id="pg_486" facs="0496"/>appraisal given by the Embassy
                            of the present political and military situation within China, there
                            remains imperative need to consider the broad and the long-swing
                            political and psychological aspects of the problem which is presented by
                            President Chiang’s approach and China’s request.</p>
                        <p>During the past two years, and especially within recent months, the
                            Chinese have been given, in appearance at least, a preferred position
                            among the United Nations; they have been accorded a place as one of the
                            four powers among and by whom leadership is assumed and of whom
                            leadership is expected toward the winning of the war and establishing of
                            an international organization for the safeguarding of the security and
                            the advancing of the welfare of the United Nations. During a longer
                            period, the Chinese, in their resistance to Japan have received
                            encouragement and support from the United States. In the according to
                            the Chinese by official action of their new position in world affairs
                            the United States has taken a leading part. In regard to the problem of
                            victory over Japan and the problem of security arrangements thereafter
                            in Southeastern Asia and the Pacific, China and the united have, greater
                            concern than have any other powers, and, the concepts and desires of
                            China and of the United States more nearly coincide than do those of any
                            other powers. China and the United States take china seriously and we
                            evaluate China’s potentialities more highly than do any other powers.
                            The Chinese have come to expect of the United States sympathy, friendly
                            cooperation and generous support.</p>
                        <p>In the postwar world the attitude of and the position taken by the
                            Chinese is going to be of importance in the alignment of the powers. In
                            the relations of the United States, Great Britain and the Soviet Union
                            there are bound to be stresses and strains. The Soviet Union is in all
                            probability going to be powerful. The Soviet Union is in all probability
                            going to create problems for Great Britain, create problems for the
                            United States, and create problems for Great Britain and the United
                            States. There is in all probability not going to be clear sailing in
                            relations between Great Britain and the United States: there will be
                            competition and controversy in regard to matters economic and in regard
                            to matters political. The attitude of China vis-à-vis Great Britain and
                            the United States and the Soviet Union will be of importance. That China
                            be a well-disposed member of the “Big Four” combination is desirable.
                            But, that, when there comes stresses and strains in the relations of the
                            United States with, on the one hand Great Britain and with, on the other
                            hand the Soviet Union, China be well disposed toward the United States
                            is, from point of view of United States interests and concerns, even
                            more imperatively desirable.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the fact that Great Britain and the Soviet Union have
                            assented—though somewhat grudgingly—to the giving to China <pb n="487" xml:id="pg_487" facs="0497"/>of a place in the “Big Four” group, the
                            Chinese have been and continue to be suspicious of Great Britain and
                            apprehensive of the Soviet Union. The Chinese have been and are very
                            little suspicious of the United States and not at all apprehensive of
                            the United States; they have, comparatively speaking, confidence in us
                            and they are, comparatively speaking, well disposed toward us. As
                            friendship between nations goes, it can accurately be said that the
                            United States and China are natural and actual friends and allies. As
                            community of interest between nations goes, it can accurately be said
                            that in regard to the defeat of Japan and in regard to establishing
                            conditions of security and welfare in and around the Pacific Ocean the
                            United States and China have a primacy of common interest.</p>
                        <p>It is important, especially for postwar purposes, that the present
                            attitude of the Chinese toward the United States be maintained. It is
                            important that nothing be allowed to develop from which it might result
                            that China withdraw from confidence in and reliance upon the United
                            States, and move into a position of reliance upon the Soviet Union or
                            acceptance of the Japanese thesis that oriental peoples must-combine in
                            opposition to the influence of occidental peoples. In the postwar
                            period, the United States will need, in connection with relations with
                            Great Britain and in connection with relations with the Soviet Union the
                            good will of China toward her major associates and particularly toward
                            the United States.</p>
                        <p>We and our allies are still at war. The military experts say that we have
                            a considerable distance to go before victory over the Nazis and a long
                            distance to go before victory over Japan. So long as we remain at war,
                            military considerations come first, political considerations second and
                            economic considerations third in order of assessed importance. That
                            being the case, the military and political aspects of the question of a
                            loan now to China take precedence over the economic aspects. In
                            connection with the military and political considerations, psychological
                            factors are of substantial importance.</p>
                        <p>It therefore is imperatively desirable that the military, the political
                            and the psychological aspects of this Chinese request for a loan be
                            examined from every angle and in all their bearings, both short-swing
                            and long-swing.</p>
                        <p>Should a decision be made not to respond favorably to the Chinese
                            request, the problem how most diplomatically to say “no” should be
                            carefully considered and skillfully handled.</p>
                        <p rend="center">II</p>
                        <p>There is warrant for serious doubt whether we should under any
                            circumstances give to this Chinese request a flat refusal. It is
                            believed <pb n="488" xml:id="pg_488" facs="0498"/>that we might to
                            advantage explore and act upon the possibility of taking advantage of
                            this request as a springboard or even a foundation for a negotiation
                            with the Chinese envisaging a meeting by them of certain needs and
                            desiderata of ours in exchange for a loan by us to them of a part at
                            least of the amount which they request. We should keep in mind the fact
                            that at the time when the loan which we made them some time ago of
                            $500,000,000 was under discussion point was made on both sides that in
                            all probability there would arise a need and a request on the part of
                            the Chinese for another loan, and that then and subsequently there has
                            been consideration of ways and means whereby further assistance by this
                            country to China might be afforded. It should also be kept in mind that
                            in order to be in position to grant such a loan to China, in any amount,
                            the executive branch of this Government will have to go to the
                            legislative branch—which fact gives us the basis on which to explain to
                            the Chinese the necessity for taking time to consider the matter.</p>
                        <p>Even in this period of large financial outlays, a request by China for a
                            loan of $1,000,000,000 is a large request and, as a proposal, should be
                            scrutinized in a large way. Were a proposal comparable to this made to a
                            private banking firm, it may be assumed that in all probability the firm
                            thus approached would assign to several of its best men the task of
                            making an exhaustive study of the proposal. Our problem is by no means
                            exactly analogous to that with which those men would be dealing—for,
                            they would be considering their problem almost exclusively from a
                            financial point of view; yet, they would be taking into consideration
                            political as well as economic factors; our concern, however, is broader
                            than would be theirs and, for that reason, the study which we should
                            make of the question should be even more careful than that which they
                            would make were the problem theirs. This leads to a query of whether a
                            practical way of going about dealing with this question might not be
                            that of choosing and sending to China to look into this matter a
                            commissioner or a group of commissioners who might confer with Chinese
                            officials and with American authorities on the spot, make as thorough a
                            study as time and conditions would permit of the situation, and make
                            recommendations both to us and to the Chinese in the premises. A variant
                            might be the establishing of a joint American-Chinese commission to
                            study the question and make recommendations. An additional but very
                            important function of a joint American-Chinese commission might be a
                            study of China’s post-war reconstruction problems and a formulation of a
                            detailed and balanced program containing an analysis of China’s
                            transportation, industrial and agricultural needs and suggesting methods
                            of providing funds and matériel to meet those needs. <pb n="489" xml:id="pg_489" facs="0499"/>A loan, if granted, would thus be
                            linked with the important objective of American collaboration in the
                            post-war reconstruction of China, and the joint commission might perhaps
                            be used as an agency for initiating such collaboration.</p>
                        <p>In any event, from the political point of view, it is strongly urged that
                            in our consideration of this Chinese request we go beyond mere
                            consideration of the question whether China at this moment needs such a
                            loan and whether such a loan now would serve useful immediate economic
                            and political ends, and that we address ourselves to the question
                            whether we might not make the fact of this Chinese approach become of
                            service to us in pursuit of important ends which are both of short-swing
                            and of long-swing concern to us; and that we by all means endeavor to
                            avoid having to give the Chinese anything in the nature of a flat
                            refusal.</p>

                        based on careful exploration with General Stilwell,<note n="5" xml:id="d424fn5">Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding General, United
                            States Army Forces in China, Burma, and India.</note> Dr. Soong,<note n="6" xml:id="d424fn6">T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> Embassy, other relevant authorities.</p>
                    <p>1. Preparations now underway for Burma campaign to be launched at
                            specified date. These preparations plus requirements of Air Force are
                            using every pound of every ton Air Transport Command can carry. Military
                            pressure for space on air transports into China will increase
                            geometrically until China operation finishes. With most minor exceptions
                            none of our goods have slightest chance of being brought into China by
                            air in wartime.</p>
                        <p>2. Northwest highway via Iran, Russia and Sinkiang seems increasingly
                            dubious means of bringing substantial quantities of goods into China.
                            Adequacy of existing transport facilities through Iran now in grave
                            doubt. Chinese authorities taking position that in any case highway
                            should primarily supply armies near Sian although prospect these will
                            soon fight Japanese is most remote. Finally General Stilwell privately
                            informs me he will probably have to take for his own uses most trucks
                            intended for northwest highway.</p>
                        <p>3. Betting even, Burma offensive cannot be immediately initiated.
                                Delay will entail further wait for monsoon season deferring action
                                until January 1944. If begun tomorrow fighting will require several

                                wholly in Army hands and General Stilwell is unshakably determined

                                will be inadequate supply line even with most stringent
                                restrictions.</p>
                        <p>4. Under circumstances feel strongly that reconsideration of our China
                            program is urgently desirable. Many items intended for wartime use in
                            China cannot possibly be imported. Conversely have learned of need for
                            certain categories of items which will be approved for wartime
                            importation and should be sponsored by Lend-Lease but are not in
                            program. Had hoped carry work through primary stages here with aid of
                            data requested in my number 1539, December 23<note n="7" xml:id="d424fn7">Not printed.</note> but am now fully convinced this
                            impossible owing my lack background and almost total ignorance of all
                            civilian Lend-Lease projects among General Stilwell’s staff. Moreover
                            feel questions of policy involved too serious and farreaching for me to
                            handle without prior consultation with you. Think satisfactory policy
                            can be laid down and machinery organized to implement it with reasonable
                            ease after consultation but consider consultation absolutely necessary
                            prerequisite.</p>
                        <p>5. Therefore convinced should return promptly to Washington for
                            consultation. Have talked with Doctor Soong, General Stilwell and
                            Embassy and all agree this is wisest course. Doctor Soong has offered me
                            place in his plane if he returns soon. Impossible summarize situation
                            adequately in cable but earnestly hope you will accept my
                            recommendation. In any case am positive usefulness here nil until after
                            Washington talks. Consequently trust response will be early and
                            favorable. Also request authority return by Army transport if Doctor
                            Soong’s departure delayed as his plans most indefinite. Regards.

                        <item>The Treasury and other interested agencies have been considering the
                            possibility of lend-leasing silver to members of the United Nations for
                            coinage purposes. The terms on which the United States would be willing
                            to lend-lease silver have not yet been completely determined but it is
                            probable that the lend-leased silver will have to be returned on an
                            ounce-for-ounce basis within a fairly reasonable period after the war.
                            The lend-leasing of silver to members of the United Nations for coinage
                            purposes is designed chiefly to overcome difficulties created by the
                            presence of large numbers of American troops in certain
                            countries.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Hsi was informed that the Treasury felt that under present
                            circumstances the lend-leasing of silver would not seem to be practical
                            and feasible largely because of shipping and minting difficulties
                            involved. The United States minting facilities are already overtaxed and
                            the trend here is to decrease as much as possible the minting of coins
                            requiring silver and other metals needed for the war effort.</item>

                            <item>In order to have any effect on the situation in China, China would
                                probably require very large amounts of silver. This raises problems

                                        already overtaxed. Furthermore, the minting of silver coins
                                        requires alloys which are in short supply at present and the
                                        trend here is to decrease as much as possible the minting of

                            <item>It is likely that any coins released for circulation in Free China
                                would practically immediately go out of circulation into hoarding.
                                Furthermore, it could be expected that the silver content of the
                                coins would soon be worth more than their face value, and,
                                therefore, the coins would be melted down for their silver content.
                                Unless coins were issued in very large amounts, it could not be
                                expected that the hoarding of such silver coins would have any

                    <p>211. 1. A radio transmitter requested by the Chinese in November 1941 under
                        Lend Lease and approved by the appropriate agencies of this Government has
                        been completed and is ready for shipment. During the latter part of 1942 the
                        question of diverting this transmitter for the use of agencies of this
                        Government arose. At that time inquiry was made of Dr. Alfred C. Sze,<note n="21" xml:id="d427fn21">Sao-ke Alfred Sze, former Chinese Ambassador in
                            the United States.</note> in the absence of Dr. Soong, in regard to the
                        importance attached by the Chinese Government to this equipment. Dr. Sze
                        informed the Department that the transmitter was intended for use partially
                        for broadcasting within China and also to maintain continuous communication
                        with the United States and that the need for the transmitter was both
                        important and immediate. These and other factors were given careful
                        consideration by the appropriate departments of this Government, including
                        the War Department, and it was unanimously agreed that this equipment should
                        not be diverted but be shipped to Chungking with as little delay as
                        possible. The Department has now been informed that in a message dated
                        January 26 received by the War Department, General Stilwell stated that
                        shipment of this equipment, which he referred to as a psychological warfare
                        radio transmitter, would mean the abandonment of various vital projects and
                        he strongly recommended, in view of air transport limitations, the
                        indefinite postponement of the shipment until such time as land
                        communications are reopened.</p>
                    <p>2. While the Department is fully aware of the limitations imposed on the
                        shipment of supplies by air and of the consideration that other supplies may
                        be more vital and necessary, it believes, in view of the delicacy at the
                        present time of the question of the shipment of supplies to China, that it
                        would be advisable, if the Embassy perceives no objection, to bring to the
                        attention of Dr. Soong or to a member of the Generalissimo’s staff the
                        difficulty of shipping this transmitter into Chungking in the immediate
                        future in view of the considerations mentioned by General Stilwell. It is
                        also suggested that the Embassy ascertain whether the transmitter is
                        urgently needed, the relative importance attached by the Chinese authorities
                        to this equipment and, having in mind the Embassy’s 845, July 16, 1942, 10

                    <p>212. Department’s 211, February 10, 10 p.m. in regard to radio transmitter.
                        Department is now in receipt of a communication from the Munitions
                        Assignment Committee stating that in view of General Stilwell’s
                        recommendation that shipment of transmitter be postponed to the indefinite
                        future, the Committee has unanimously recommended to the Munitions
                        Assignment Board that assignment of the transmitter to China be cancelled;
                        that the Chief Signal Officer retain control of this equipment but be
                        instructed to permit the Office of War Information to use transmitter until
                        such time as further action is taken by the Committee in regard to
                        assignment to China; and that when shipping is available to Chungking
                        reconsideration be given by the Committee to matter of assignment of
                        transmitter to Chungking.</p>
                    <p>Unless you perceive urgent reasons for discussing the question of the radio
                        transmitter with General Stilwell and Chinese officials the Department
                        desires, in view of the foregoing, that this matter be held in suspense
                        pending Dr. Soong’s return to Washington.</p>

                    <p>With particular reference to item 4 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Mr. Ray stated
                        that he had been informed yesterday by the Air Transport Command that the
                        schedule for large increases in air freight capacity on the Chinese-India
                        run in 1943 has already been postponed for three months. Specifically he
                        said that it had been planned beginning in March to send to India 10
                        transport planes a month. This has now been postponed until June. Mr. Ray
                        said that he believed additional whittling down of the proposed schedule was
                        under consideration. In discussing this matter with Mr. Stanton and me Mr.
                        Ray said that he thought that a letter from this Department to the Secretary
                        of War on the subject might be helpful and that he thought the Department
                        could verify his statements by conferring with Colonel Mason of the Air
                        Transport Command who, he believed, would not hesitate to inform the
                        Department of the above developments. Mr. Hornbeck, who came in for a moment
                        while Mr. Ray was present said, in this connection, that he thought
                        consideration of this whole matter would now have to await General
                            Arnold’s<note n="25" xml:id="d429fn25">Henry H. Arnold, Commanding
                            General of United States Army Air Forces.</note> return to this
                        country.</p>
                    <p>Without further reference to item 4 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Mr. Ray said
                        that the supplies he had in mind included arsenal material, actual
                        munitions, spare parts for motor vehicles and the like. It might well also
                        include, he said, items in which the Chinese expressed special interest such
                        as the radio transmitter which has been the subject of recent consideration.
                        Many of the supplies he has in mind are, he said, already in India. In
                        answer to questions, Mr. Ray seemed to indicate that, short of consultation
                        with Dr. T. V. Soong upon Dr. Soong’s arrival in this country, there is no
                        way of being sure that we know what items the Chinese wish assigned
                        priority. He agreed that there are in general three important categories of
                        supplies which the Chinese themselves desire to have flown into China: (1)
                        supplies which General Stilwell considers essential for his planned
                        offensive in Burma; (2) supplies needed for maintaining and increasing the
                        activities of General Chennault’s air force in China and (3) Lend-Lease
                        supplies destined for the Chinese themselves. So far as Mr. Ray knew there
                        is no authoritative indication as to the proportion of total air freight
                        space which the Chinese desire to be accorded to each of these three
                        categories of supplies. Presumably the Chinese want more space for each of
                        the three. However, when the issue is one of relative priority as between
                        these three categories, it is probable that only Dr. Soong or the
                        Generalissimo can speak with authority and in any particular case the
                        authoritative views of the Chinese Government may likely raise delicate
                        questions as to the appropriate jurisdiction in this field of various United
                        States authorities such as General Stilwell, General Chennault,<note n="26" xml:id="d429fn26">Brig. Gen. Claire L. Chennault, commanding United

                    <p>In his report of January 25, 1943 to the Congress of the United States, the
                        Lend-Lease Administrator, Mr. Stettinius, made this statement: <quote rend="blockquote">

                            <p>“Lend-lease aid to China in 1941 was aimed especially at improving
                                transport over the Burma Eoad. It resulted in more than doubling
                                monthly tonnage carried over the route. Even then, however,
                                transportation difficulties kept total shipments comparatively
                                small. Following the loss of Burma, shipments to China were reduced
                                to a trickle, carried principally by cargo planes from India. We
                                have now taken measures which are considerably increasing these
                                plane shipments and we shall also find other means to get to China
                                the arms she needs.” What, in the light of the fact that at the time
                                when lend-lease program include some planes, most of them fighters
                                and trainers, several thousand trucks and some ordnance, ammunition,

                    <p>369. Chinese press welcomes extension of Lend-Lease program and urges
                        American Government to do its best to aid China despite transportation <pb n="502" xml:id="pg_502" facs="0512"/>difficulties. <hi rend="italic">National Herald</hi> says value of Lend-Lease Act should not be
                        appraised merely in terms of material supplies, for psychological effect has
                        also been extremely beneficial. It is arranged under which United Nations
                        are assisting one another both materially and spiritually. It is common
                        knowledge that China has not been given aid commensurate with her
                        requirements, a fact openly admitted by Lend-Lease Administrator Stettinius,
                        but there are now unmistakable indication[s] that United States will lose no
                        time in rushing aid to China. One sign is formation of Fourteenth Air Force
                        under General Chennault which indicates that more American planes will be
                        sent to China to attack Japanese invaders and Japan proper.</p>

                        Lend-Lease aid to China is essentially one of more transport planes.
                        Editorial states China has made valuable contributions to Allied war effort
                        and to American national defense in her war of resistance.; that China has
                        not received amount of Lend-Lease aid to which she is entitled; that
                        gratification is felt at popular demand in United States for greater aid to
                        China although no improvement has been made so far; that it is easier to
                        provide transport planes than to recover Burma and reopen highway; and that
                        responsibility for piling up of Chinese supplies in India does not lie with
                        China or difficulty in transportation but with failure of United States to
                        send adequate transport planes and to utilize fully Sino-India air
                        route.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are most anxious to do all in
                        their power to assist the Chinese Government to obtain the non-military
                        supplies which they require in order to maintain their war effort and have
                        lately been considering whether there were any steps which could usefully be
                        taken to facilitate the flow of such supplies to China. Hitherto the
                        difficulties of transportation have greatly limited the amount of
                        non-military supplies which it has been possible actually to deliver to
                        China. However the increase in the carrying capacity of air transport
                        between India and China and the prospect that it may at a not too distant
                        date, be possible to deliver up to 1,700 tons of goods by the overland
                        route, should, it is to be hoped, enable appreciably larger quantities of
                        such stores to reach China in the future.</p>
                    <p>In any case it is to be anticipated that the Chinese authorities, encouraged
                        by the prospect of improved methods of transportation, will endeavour to
                        obtain very considerable quantities of non-military stores from the United
                        States and to a lesser extent from the United Kingdom and other sources of
                        supply. It will, however, be some time before the transportation position
                        can be improved to any very appreciable extent and indeed, until a radical
                        change in the military situation takes place it is to be feared that
                        transportation facilities will always be inadequate to carry all the
                        non-military supplies which the Chinese Government would wish to obtain.</p>
                    <p>In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government feel that it is very
                        desirable that some kind of machinery should be set up with the object of
                        ensuring that the delivery of Chinese goods to India (where there are said
                        to be at the moment 75,000 tons of Chinese supplies lying awaiting
                        transport) should be appropriately related to the capacity for on-carriage
                        to China. Otherwise there is the risk of serious congestion and
                        disorganisation occurring and of goods deteriorating through lack of storage
                        space. His Majesty’s Government also think it would be very helpful if some
                        machinery were established which would make it easier to ensure that the
                        goods actually procured for and furnished to China were those best
                        calculated to be of immediate value. For example, 100 tons of spare parts or
                        of scarce materials to enable Chinese industrial plants to continue
                        operations might be of greater benefit to China than the shipment of a far
                        larger quantity of finished goods. Finally, some machinery seems necessary
                        to ensure that supplies agreed to be furnished to China from the United
                        States or the United Kingdom are made available <pb n="504" xml:id="pg_504" facs="0514"/>and delivered in order of importance and urgency. His
                        Majesty’s Government feel that the creation of some such machinery would not
                        only be of great assistance to the Chinese Government, but would also be of
                        real value to the United States and United Kingdom Governments, in that it
                        would assure the co-ordinated placing of orders in the two countries and
                        would facilitate the economical use of their production and shipping
                        resources.</p>
                    <p>With this object, His Majesty’s Government suggest the early setting-up of an
                        Anglo-American “screen” at Chungking, consisting of one United States
                        officer and one British officer—possibly from their respective Embassies—who
                        would have the right to co-opt others as necessary. The Chinese Government
                        would of course be represented on this body. Their representation could
                        either be direct or through a liaison officer. This “screen” would, in fact,
                        closely resemble the British-American-Co-ordinating Committee at Ankara and
                        it is suggested that the procedure adopted in the case of Turkey should be
                        followed as far as is practicable. All Chinese requirements of non-military
                        supplies from abroad, except those from the U. S. S. R., but including those
                        from India, should be notified to the proposed body for “screening”. Orders
                        approved by the “screen” would be submitted simultaneously to Washington and
                        London. The authorities in London would await the comments of the United
                        States authorities before arranging any procurement action as far as they
                        were concerned.</p>
                    <p>It would, of course, be essential that the Chinese Government should approve
                        of the setting-up of the “screen” and should agree to co-operate in the
                        proper procedure. It is to be hoped, however, that they would be prepared to
                        agree since this proposal would provide the means whereby early recognition
                        could be given to their essential current and future needs and arrangements
                        made to ensure proper priority being given to their most urgent
                        requirements.</p>
                    <p>If this proposal is acceptable to the United States Government in principle,
                        it would of course be necessary for the British and American authorities to
                        work out the detailed instructions and terms of reference for the Chungking
                        “screen”. Its primary purpose would, however, be, as explained above, to
                        control production of non-military supplies to China so as to ensure that
                        the delivery of goods to India was related to the onward transport capacity
                        and that the goods were delivered in order of their importance to the
                        Chinese war effort.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty’s Government trust that these proposals will commend themselves
                        to the United States Government and that the latter will be prepared to join
                        with them in making the appropriate representations to the Chinese
                        Government.</p>

                        September 8, attended by Mr. Van Buskirk<note n="29" xml:id="d434fn29">Arthur B. Van Buskirk, Deputy Lend-Lease Administrator.</note> and Mr.
                        Ray of Lend-Lease and Mr. Hiss, Mr. Kermit Roosevelt<note n="30" xml:id="d434fn30">Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of State
                            (Acheson).</note> and myself, you will recall that there was some
                        discussion of the political considerations involved in the proposals made by
                        Mr. Van Buskirk and Mr. Ray for placing our program for Lend-Lease aid to
                        China on a more stable and effective basis. Mr. Van Buskirk’s proposal that
                        Lend-Lease for China be placed upon a contractual basis analogous to the
                        protocol we have with the U.S.S.E. was discussed but it seemed to be the
                        consensus of those present that a protocol for China Lend-Lease was not
                        advisable. The point was made that an attempt at this time to fix Lend-Lease
                        aid for China in a protocol might result in dissatisfaction on the part of
                        the Chinese in as much as the aid that could be promised on a contractual
                        basis would probably fall below present Chinese expectations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray then suggested formation of a committee of ranking officials whose
                        duty it would be to review Lend-Lease aid for China in the light of such
                        factors as transportation facilities to China, priorities, aid from other
                        sources, requirements of our own military authorities, and political
                        considerations bearing upon our relations with China, and on the basis
                        thereof to reach conclusive decisions. The committee would include officials
                        of the State and War Departments and of Lend-Lease, possibly under the
                        chairmanship of Mr. Hopkins.<note n="31" xml:id="d434fn31">Harry L. Hopkins,
                            Special Assistant to President Roosevelt and Chairman of Munitions
                            Assignments Board, United States and Great Britain.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>The discussion developed the point that Lend-Lease had encountered and was
                        encountering considerable difficulty in obtaining clearance for specific
                        items of Lend-Lease aid to China through the War Department; that in
                        numerous instances it was necessary, in order to overcome War Department
                        opposition regarding items which Lend-Lease was already committed to furnish
                        China, to submit the cases to Mr. Hopkins for decision. The purpose of the
                        proposed committee would be to act somewhat as an advance clearing house for
                        a program of Lend-Lease aid to China. It was felt that it might be possible
                        to have the War Department committed in advance <pb n="506" xml:id="pg_506" facs="0516"/>to a schedule of aid to China which would simplify the
                        problems of Lend-Lease.</p>
                    <p>It is recalled that during the discussion you expressed the opinion that one
                        of the primary functions, if not the principal function, of the proposed
                        committee would be to weigh political considerations against military and
                        related considerations and, where there was a conflict, to make decisions
                        which, while taking into account the attitude of the War Department, would
                        be based upon broad policy.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that a continuance, and when possible an augmentation, of
                        Lend-Lease aid to China along the lines of the program worked out by
                        Lend-Lease is good policy. The amount involved is not of sufficient
                        magnitude, it seems, to prove an embarrassment to our own military program.
                        It is admitted that, until broader avenues of approach to China can be
                        opened, the amount of Lend-Lease we can send to China will not have a
                        substantial material effect upon the existing situation in China. However,
                        the psychological effect of continued aid to China is important and
                        worthwhile (the psychological effect of a reduction in Lend-Lease aid to
                        China would be distinctly adverse). The economic situation in China is
                        admittedly grave. Chinese confidence in our willingness to aid China in
                        every way practicable goes a long way toward bolstering Chinese morale on
                        the political and military fronts as well as on the economic front.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the political considerations involved in our Lend-Lease
                        aid to China are of sufficient importance to warrant the active support of
                        this Department in furthering any sound proposal which the Office of
                        Lend-Lease may advocate to maintain and augment the procurement of supplies
                        for China. The suggested committee to review and make conclusive decisions
                        with regard to Lend-Lease aid to China appears to be a sound proposal and to
                        be deserving of support by the Department.</p>

                    <p>1296. Department has received from British Embassy memorandum containing
                        proposal to establish American-British-Chinese organization at Chungking to
                        screen Chinese requirements for non-military supplies from all sources
                        except Russia. It is contemplated that proposed organization would function
                        along lines already established in Turkey and certain African Territories.
                        Under this procedure, statement of essential non-military import
                        requirements would be prepared by joint screening authorities at Chungking.
                        This would be <pb n="507" xml:id="pg_507" facs="0517"/>an agreed declaration
                        of what was needed in China, but not a commitment as to what supplies could
                        be made available. Statement would then be forwarded simultaneously to
                        London and Washington for review by appropriate supply authorities. British
                        recommendations concerning sources of supply and total quantities to be made
                        available would be transmitted to Washington, where final program would be
                        determined in agreement with representatives of Combined Boards.</p>
                    <p>Purpose of this procedure would be (1) to correlate delivery into India of
                        goods destined to China with capacity for further transportation to China;
                        (2) to make certain that supplies actually provided for China are those most
                        urgently needed and that they are made available in order of their
                        importance; (3) to ensure full coordination of orders placed in the United
                        States and Great Britain to meet Chinese requirements. British have
                        suggested that American and British members of joint organization might be
                        appointed from respective Embassies, with authority to select others as
                        necessary. Lend-Lease Mission to be attached to General Stilwell’s
                        headquarters will soon proceed to China, and arrangements would contemplate
                        full cooperation between Mission and screening organization. Lend-Lease has
                        recommended that its mission constitute American representation in screening
                        group. British note also states that representation of Chinese Government on
                        screening group might be direct or through liaison officer.</p>
                    <p>It is appreciated here that screening activities would have to be on
                        restricted scale for some time, since transportation capacity is so limited.
                        It is opinion of Department, Lend-Lease and Munitions Assignment Board that
                        proposal warrants most careful consideration. We should appreciate your full
                        comments, after consultation with General Stilwell or appropriate American
                        military authorities. A prerequisite would of course be that Chinese
                        Government approve the plan and cooperate in establishing appropriate
                        procedure, but you should not discuss proposal with any representatives of
                        Chinese Government until final American decision has been made and
                        communicated to British Embassy here. Please telegraph comments.</p>

                                    China as a full partner in the war effort, is going to impede
                                    our effort to get maximum of cooperation from the Chinese, and
                                    is going to add straws to the diplomatic burden which is piling

                                    good deal easier to reason with the Chinese about the problem of

                        <item>Lend-lease aid has been repeatedly promised by the President, “despite
                            all odds to the Chinese armies and the Chinese people.” The Lend-Lease
                            Administration has considered these promises as constituting a political
                            as well as a military commitment.</item>

                        <item>When Lend-lease operations began, a broad program of military and
                            non-military aid was scheduled for delivery via the Burma Road. The loss
                            of the Burma Road made it necessary to reduce (1) procurement programs,
                            (2) existing inventories and (3) shipping schedules to China. Such
                            reductions properly impinged more heavily on the non-military than on
                            the military portion of the program.</item>

                        <item>Military Lend-lease aid to China, since the establishment of the
                            Stilwell Command, has consisted of supplies consigned to the Commanding
                            General, USAF, CB&amp;I, “for transfer to the Republic of China,” at his
                            discretion and subject to his continuing supervision over use. This
                            arrangement respecting military aid to China has been accepted by the
                            Chinese, despite their understandable preference for treatment similar
                            to that accorded the United Kingdom and Russia.</item>

                            their unsupervised use upon receipt. Included in this category are

                                Lend-Lease Administration.</note> program has been accompanied by
                            the development of an increasingly critical attitude on the part of the
                            War Department towards the continuance of any non-military Lend-lease
                            aid program for China. This attitude of the War Department is based on
                            considerations (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) of short supply in the United
                            States, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) of limited transport facilities
                            into China. But even when supply is adequate, as in the case of Canadian
                            ordnance, and transport is available, the attitude of the War Department
                            is that equipment should be furnished directly to General Stilwell for
                            use in China, and not directly to the Generalissimo. The War
                            Department’s attitude on these matters is governed entirely by military
                            considerations. The Lend-Lease Administration feels that some
                            non-military supplies should be furnished directly to the Chinese in
                            fulfilment of a national political commitment, even though some military
                            disadvantage may result.</item>

                        <item>The basic reason for the War Department position in respect to the
                            delivery of Lend-lease supplies directly to China appears to be mistrust
                            of Chinese efficiency in handling supplies made available to them
                            without close supervision. Such mistrust, however well grounded, is
                            manifestly derogatory to China’s sovereignty. To the extent that such
                            mistrust works to prevent the transfer to China of otherwise needed,
                            available, and deliverable supplies, it serves to nullify the
                            commitments contemplated in our over-all relations with China and more
                            specifically contained in our Master Lend-Lease Agreement with

                        <item>As intimated previously, the endeavors of the Lend-Lease
                                Administration are based on political considerations and political
                                pledges. These considerations are, however, ill-defined and urgently
                                in need of authoritative review.</item>
                            <label/>
                  <item>The State Department negotiates the basic agreements with China
                                setting the terms of Lend-lease aid. The Lend-Lease Administration
                                has regularly consulted the Department on all specific problems in
                                which emphasis on political factors appears pertinent to the
                                consideration of proposed China programs by the various agencies of
                                the U. S. Government. Such consultations, however, have not been of
                                such a character as to enable the State Department to review in a
                                comprehensive manner the overall political implications of the
                                non-military Lend-lease aid program for China. But even a
                                comprehensive study of the State Department of the political
                                considerations involved in Lend-Lease aid to China would not by
                                itself provide the Lend-Lease Administration with a workable
                                charter, for the State Department will not review any War Department
                                decisions or actions based on purported military considerations. The
                                War Department correspondingly <pb n="511" xml:id="pg_511" facs="0521"/>regards political considerations as not germane to

                        <item>There is thus a need for the creation of an agency, perhaps in
                            committee form, to be established with a directive from the President to
                            review, in the light of both political and military considerations, the
                            present status of our Lend-Lease program for China. Such a committee
                            might be directed to prepare recommendations concerning the extent and
                            nature of the non-military aid, if any, which should and can be
                            undertaken during 1944 to the National Government of the Republic of
                            China, apart from the Army Supply Program schedule of matériel for
                            consignment to General Stilwell. Should such recommendations commend
                            themselves to the President, this same committee might well be charged
                            with the implementation of these recommendations in some such manner as
                            the President’s Soviet Protocol Committee operates. Whether the program
                            adopted by the Committee should be communicated in full to the Chinese
                            as a detailed and specific commitment implementing our unfulfilled
                            general commitments, or whether its individual actions should be
                            reported to them from time to time, is a matter which can be left for
                            later decision.</item>

                        <item>The quantity of non-military supplies than [<hi rend="italic">that?</hi>] can be delivered to China during 1944 appears
                                likely to be small, possibly not exceeding 50,000 tons.
                                Approximately this quantity of goods will be in stock in India for
                                China Lend-lease account before the end of 1943. Present tentative
                                plans of the Lend-Lease Administration call for maintaining
                                approximately this level of supplies, by holding the ratio of new
                                forwardings from the U. S. to the rate of deliveries to China by air

                  <item>Past experience leads the Lend-Lease Administration to anticipate

                                modest a program. And there are certain classes of equipment, known
                                to be urgently needed in China, the delivery of which to China in
                                1945 requires advance scheduling decisions before the end of 1943.
                                Certain of these equipment projects represent attempted cash
                                purchases by the Chinese Government in the United States; others are

                                considerations, could lead to timely decisions which would at once

                                including the question would it be of concrete assistance to our
                                military authorities here or would it on the other hand constitute
                                merely another agency which would burden General Stilwell’s
                                headquarters with additional work such as conferences,

                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>In connection with (1), Stilwell and we are of the opinion that no good
                        political purpose is to be served by setting up any arrangement whereunder
                        the American supplies coming to China might be classified as “Allied”
                        supplies.</p>
                    <p>As regards (2), Stilwell feels that the organization would not be of concrete
                        practical help to his headquarters and might indeed add to the headquarter’s
                        work; that is, the Lend-Lease group is to be attached to his headquarters;
                        in any case the screening of supplies could be effected without setting up
                        an international organization so long as the Lend-Lease group maintains
                        sufficient liaison with the appropriate British authorities to ensure that
                        undesirable duplications in supply be avoided.</p>

                    <p>A lend-lease administration has always had great difficulty in arranging for
                        the transfer of non-military lend-lease goods to the Chinese. (Military
                        lend-lease aid to China is consigned to General Stilwell who may transfer it
                        to the Chinese Government at his discretion, retaining supervision over its
                        use.) The difficulties limiting civilian aid to China arise not only from
                        short supply and limited transport, but also, when supply is adequate and
                        transport available, from the attitude of the War Department, which looks at
                        the Chinese program purely in military terms. OLLA and the Department of
                        State have been strongly of the opinion that, aside from military
                        considerations, there are political factors of extreme importance which must
                        be taken into account. The War Department has frequently regarded these
                        political considerations as of minor importance, and only under specific
                        directives from the White House has it, in certain cases, modified its
                        supply decisions concerning China to conform with political commitments.</p>
                    <p>OLLA has therefore suggested the creation of a high ranking committee, to be
                        under the chairmanship of Mr. Harry Hopkins if possible, which would review
                        the present status of our lend-lease program for China in the light of
                        political as well as military considerations. This committee would prepare
                        recommendations concerning the extent and nature of the non-military aid
                        which should be provided to China during 1944, apart from the Army Supply
                        Program Schedule of <pb n="514" xml:id="pg_514" facs="0524"/>Material to be
                        consigned to Stilwell. If these recommendations are approved by the
                        President, the committee could be charged with the implementation of the
                        program, having much the same responsibility with regard to the Chinese
                        program as the President’s Soviet Protocol Committee has with respect to the

                    <p>Reference is made to the Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> of
                        July 27, 1943, in which it is proposed that machinery be set up at Chungking
                        for joint screening of Chinese requirements of non-military supplies.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States desires that the principle of joint
                        screening be extended wherever practicable for the mutual benefit of the
                        governments and areas concerned. This Government believes the extension of
                        this principle particularly desirable in several areas of the eastern
                        hemisphere where it is not presently in full operation.</p>
                    <p>It is, however, the opinion of this Government that the establishment of a
                        formal organization at Chungking for this purpose should be postponed until
                        such time as the transportation difficulties now encountered in supplying
                        China’s needs may be more appreciably overcome. It is believed that this
                        consideration is of great importance in assuring the future favorable
                        reaction of the Government of China to any such procedure.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States is prepared at all times to collaborate
                        with the British Government in any steps which may usefully be taken to
                        facilitate the flow of supplies into China. With this end in view the
                        proposal embodied in the Embassy’s <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> will

                    <p>For the past several weeks this Division has had under consideration an
                        informal note from Mr. Oscar Cox, General Counsel of the Lend-Lease
                        Administration, addressed to Mr. Eugene V. Rostow,<note n="1" xml:id="d441fn1">Adviser on Lend-Lease Affairs to the Assistant
                            Secretary of State (Acheson).</note> in which Mr. Cox asks “What about a
                        reciprocal aid agreement with China?”</p>
                    <p>The proposal was discussed with appropriate officials in this Department, the
                        War Department, Lend-Lease Administration, the Export-Import Bank and with
                        Mr. Lauchlin Currie.<note n="2" xml:id="d441fn2">Administrative Assistant to
                            President Roosevelt.</note> The War Department had obtained, several
                        months ago, the views of General Stilwell<note n="3" xml:id="d441fn3">Gen.
                            Joseph W. Stilwell, Commanding General, United States Army Forces in
                            China, Burma, and India.</note> and he was strongly opposed to reverse
                        lend-lease as applied to his command. Under these circumstances the matter
                        was not pushed. Also, Mr. Currie requested that the matter be held in
                        abeyance pending the arrival of an United States Army officer who had been
                        concerned with the handling of supplies in China and was on his way to
                        Washington.</p>
                    <p>A new development last week throws an entirely different light on the
                        subject. In connection with the re-acquisition by the United States Army,
                        from the Chinese Government, of certain military planes which the latter
                        originally had purchased in the United States, Generalissimo Chiang
                            Kai-Shek<note n="4" xml:id="d441fn4">President of the Chinese Executive
                            Yuan (Premier).</note> is said to have indicated that his Government was
                        taking action through appropriate channels to negotiate a reciprocal
                        lend-lease agreement between China and the United States. Correspondence
                        relating to this aspect of the subject are attached as Exhibits 1 and 2
                            respectively.<note n="5" xml:id="d441fn5">Neither printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>It is assumed that the Department would not want to decline to negotiate a
                        reciprocal aid agreement with China. With a view to overcoming the
                        objections of General Stilwell, it was suggested informally <pb n="516" xml:id="pg_516" facs="0526"/>to representatives of the War Department
                        that a provision might be included in the agreement which would allow our
                        forces in China to continue to purchase supplies and services where
                        expedient. Major Gaud of the International Division of the War Department
                        stated over the telephone on Friday, November 20, that a radio message was
                        being dispatched to General Stilwell explaining the situation and requesting
                        his comments. No answer has yet been received. Major Gaud said that he will
                        let us know as soon as an answer is received.</p>
                    <p>In giving consideration to Mr. Cox’s query in regard to a reciprocal aid
                        agreement with China, we also obtained information concerning several other
                        aspects of the problem which is summarized below.</p>
                    <list>
                        <label>1.</label>
                        <item>As would be expected, the amount of defense articles transferred to
                            China under lend-lease has been small since the Burma road was closed.
                            In the third quarter of 1942 the total was only $16,640,000. The
                            attached table (Exhibit 3)<note n="6" xml:id="d441fn6">Not
                                printed.</note> gives detailed information concerning lend-lease to
                            China compared with other countries.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It can be assumed that the monetary value of reciprocal aid that might
                            be obtained from China would be unimportant. It is limited in the first
                            place by the small number of troops and the restricted scope of our
                            current military operations in China. Furthermore, as General Stilwell
                            is opposed to obtaining his supplies and services by reverse lend-lease,
                            it is probable that he would continue to a considerable extent to pay
                            cash even if a reciprocal aid agreement were concluded.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>The amount of reciprocal aid that we are likely to request is so small
                            that the question of China’s financial ability to furnish it is not a
                            serious problem. But the financial and exchange situation in China is
                            very bad. Prices are rising rapidly. The Government appears to have
                            exhausted possibilities of raising funds by taxation and progressive
                            currency inflation is in progress. While the United States and, to a
                            lesser extent, Great Britain have made available to China large amounts
                            of foreign exchange, transportation difficulties prevent China from
                            using it on a large scale for imports. Converting such exchange into
                            local currency for domestic use results in further increase in the
                            amount of currency in circulation thus aggravating inflation. The
                            foreign exchange value of the Chinese National dollar is pegged but
                            there exists an active black market at which its value in terms of
                            United States dollars is much below the official rate.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Inasmuch as the Chinese Government cannot obtain additional tax
                            revenue with which to pay for any goods or services that it might supply
                            our troops, it would appear that any reverse lend-lease by that country
                            would necessitate increasing further the amount of currency in
                            circulation. As pointed out above, however, the amount involved <pb n="517" xml:id="pg_517" facs="0527"/>would be small and, moreover,
                            the immediate effect upon the financial situation in China of current
                            purchases by our armed forces of supplies and services in that country
                            is not very different. In order to pay for such goods and services, our
                            forces must exchange United States money for local currency which the
                            Chinese Government can supply only by printing it.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>The question was raised as to whether China might be asked to furnish
                            raw materials for American war industries as reciprocal aid. While it
                            may be well to keep in mind the possibility of asking China to do so at
                            some future date, when supply routes are reopened, it would not appear
                            reasonable to make such a request now. A substantial part of China’s
                            exports to the United States are used to pay off loans by the
                            Reconstruction Finance Corporation. During the four months, June to
                            September, United States general imports from China averaged only
                            $386,000, equivalent to a yearly rate of $4,632,000, whereas payments
                            due the Reconstruction Finance Corporation on account of principal and
                            interest on its loans in the year 1943 total $14,165,204.82.</item>

                        General Stilwell’s comments are received, it is believed that the Embassy
                        should be told that we should be glad to enter into negotiations looking to

                    <p>Under instructions from Dr. Herbert Feis, Economic Adviser, I called upon
                        General Carter, Chief Fiscal Officer of the War Department, at his office in
                        the Pentagon Building (Room 4–E-448) at 5:30 p.m. today to discuss
                        informally an urgent problem which he had brought up with Dr. Feis regarding
                        the exchange rate at which American soldiers in China were paid and a
                        proposal by General Carter that the problem be solved through “reverse
                        Lend-Lease”.</p>
                    <p>General Carter explained that he had recently had several urgent telegrams
                        from General Stilwell on the subject. There were two related problems
                        involved: one concerning the purchase in China of vital supplies for the use
                        of our armed forces and the other concerning the payment of our Army
                        officers and men in China.</p>
                    <pb n="518" xml:id="pg_518" facs="0528"/>
                    <p>He said that General Stilwell in one telegram had requested authorization to
                        ship into China from India $400,000 in United States currency in order to
                        facilitate the purchase of supplies. General Carter could not grant such
                        requests without violating our Government’s arrangements with regard to the
                        support of the official rate of exchange. Yet there was urgent need for the
                        establishment of a more satisfactory method of purchasing supplies in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>The other problem had been temporarily solved so far as Army officers
                        stationed in China were concerned by per diem allowances of $15 per day, but
                        even this amount was unsatisfactory.</p>
                    <p>General Carter pointed out that these problems, pressing as they now are,
                        would immediately become vital if we were to expand our forces in China to
                        the number that may logically be required before the end of hostilities.</p>
                    <p>He referred to the fiscal arrangements made in connection with the current
                        North African campaign in which the troops are being paid in special “gold
                        seal” United States currency notes which can be exchanged only at an
                        official rate of 75 francs per dollar. After one year these notes are to be
                        withdrawn and payments made to the troops in francs.</p>
                    <p>General Carter suggested that through reverse Lend-Lease the Chinese
                        Government might supply either in kind or in advances of the Chinese
                        currency required to purchase them the supplies needed by our armed forces
                        and the elements now provided by per diem allowances to officers.</p>
                    <p>He suggested that an index might be worked out by the Embassy at Chungking
                        upon which estimates could be made each month of the amount required in
                        terms of Chinese currency to supply each officer with light, heat, quarters
                        (including necessary servants) and food. This amount would not be very large
                        and would replace the per diem now paid. General Carter suggested that any
                        portion of an officer’s pay he desired to change into Chinese currency
                        should be exchanged at the official rate. He suggested that a similar
                        arrangement should be made with regard to the purchase of supplies.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I would report General Carter’s remarks to Dr. Feis and to the
                        Ambassador in Chungking and, as arranged by Dr. Feis with General Carter, to
                        Mr. Harry White<note n="7" xml:id="d442fn7">Assistant to the Secretary of
                            the Treasury.</note> in the Treasury Department. I agreed with General
                        Carter that a possible solution of the Army’s problems in this connection
                        might lie in the negotiation of a reciprocal Lend-Lease agreement and the
                        utilization of “reverse Lend-Lease”.</p>

                    <p>Under instructions from Dr. Herbert Feis, Economic Adviser, I called upon Mr.
                        Harry White of the Treasury Department at 11:00 a.m. today to inform him of
                        Brigadier General Arthur H. Carter’s suggestion with regard to the
                        establishment of a “reverse Lend-Lease” arrangement under which American
                        Army supplies which must be purchased in China would be supplied by the
                        Chinese Government either in kind or through advances of Chinese currency
                        along with the elements now provided for through the US $15 per diem granted
                        to our Army officers in China. (See memorandum of conversation of December
                        4.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. White said that he was much interested in General Carter’s suggestion and
                        saw no reason why it could not be implemented. He understood that the
                        Chinese Government was not unfavorably disposed toward “reverse Lend-Lease”
                        and that this request was so reasonable and relatively small in magnitude
                        that he saw no reason why some such arrangement could not be worked out in
                        from three days to a week of negotiation. He suggested that I should tell
                        this to Dr. Feis and General Carter. He then said that for the past two
                        months he had been rather expecting that General Carter would arrange some
                        solution of this nature and was glad to see it developing, although he had
                        preferred to “sit back and let General Carter work it out in his own
                        way.”</p>
                    <p>Mr. White next mentioned the problem that was facing our Foreign Service
                        officers in China and the single Treasury representative there due to the
                        rising cost of living and asked me to assure the Ambassador and the Far
                        Eastern Division of the State Department that the Treasury was not only
                        aware of the problem but now had its legal experts at work on a possible
                        solution (possibly through loss by exchange compensation).</p>
                    <p>Mr. White in closing the interview urged that if a “reverse Lend-Lease”
                        arrangement was worked out the Embassy should try informally and personally
                        to “educate the American Army officers in China to understand that per diem
                        in kind or in Chinese currency is the fairest and most satisfactory method
                        of handling the matter from an over-all as well as a personal point of
                        view.” He stated that the morale factor in this connection appeared to him
                        most important.</p>

                    <p>This conference was called to consider an inquiry by General Carter, Chief
                        Fiscal Officer of the War Department (S. O. S.) as to whether reverse
                        lend-lease procedure could be used to obviate or alleviate difficulties
                        experienced by United States military forces in China as a result of the
                        artificial levels at which the official United States dollar–Chinese
                        National dollar exchange rate is pegged and to consider the advisability of
                        proceeding with the negotiation of a reciprocal aid agreement.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Foster explained that American troops in China are paid, at least in
                        part, in United States currency and that the troops are exchanging it on the
                        black market for local currency at rates much more favorable than the
                        official rate. Without this advantage the, purchasing power of the pay which
                        our troops receive would be extremely small.</p>
                    <p>It was recognized by those present that it would be desirable to eliminate
                        dealings by our troops on the black market. In response to a question,
                        Colonel Foster indicated that it would not be feasible to grant a special
                        increase in the pay of our troops in China so that they could be paid as
                        many Chinese National dollars (computed at the official rate) as they now
                        get by exchanging United States currency for Chinese National dollars on the
                        black market.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Currie stated that he favored, and that he understood the Treasury to
                        favor, a revision of the official rate but that the Chinese Government was
                        opposed to further depreciation of the foreign exchange value of their
                        currency.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hiss suggested that the Chinese Government might be willing to provide,
                        as reciprocal aid, Chinese National dollars at a special rate for United
                        States troops. Colonel Foster undertook to take up <pb n="521" xml:id="pg_521" facs="0531"/>this proposal with General Stilwell who
                        appeared to have been opposed to such a solution last month. (See message
                        from General Stilwell, paraphrased below.) Colonel Foster agreed to show to
                        the appropriate officer of this Department the message on this subject to be
                        sent to General Stilwell. Mr. Bane undertook to ascertain the reaction of
                        the OLLA to such a proposal.<note n="*" xml:id="d444fn13">I will take the

                        expressed the hope that the benefits of any arrangement utilizing reciprocal
                        aid procedure to alleviate the hardships of American troops in China would
                        be extended also to other Americans such as those connected with our Embassy
                        and consular establishments in that country.</p>
                    <p>A general discussion of the advisability of proceeding with negotiations
                        looking to a reciprocal aid agreement brought out the fact that the Chinese
                        Government apparently desired such an agreement and that, so far as is
                        known, none of the interested agencies of the United States Government has
                        any objection to the proposed agreement providing that it meets the approval
                        of General Stilwell.</p>
                    <p>Detailed consideration was given to the views of General Stilwell as

                        which has been paraphrased as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

                    <p>It was agreed that the proposed agreement should be so worded that General
                        Stilwell could continue to make purchases for cash, without recourse to
                        reciprocal aid procedure, when he found it preferable to do so. It was felt
                        that the other recommendations pertained to the policy which might be
                        pursued under the proposed agreement rather than to the wording of the
                        agreement itself. The conclusion was reached that negotiations might be
                        begun looking to an agreement which would not specifically embody all of
                        General Stilwell’s recommendations but would not be inconsistent with
                        them.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Feis raised the question as to who in the Department should be
                        responsible in the first instance for handling the proposed reciprocal aid
                        agreement. It was understood that Mr. Willoughby, reporting through
                        appropriate channels, would assume primary responsibility.</p>

                    <p>76. 1. Consideration has been given by officers of this Department, of the
                        War Department, and of the Lend-Lease Administration to the possibility of
                        concluding a so-called reverse Lend-Lease agreement with China similar to
                        those already concluded with Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. There
                        have been some informal indications reported to the Department that the
                        Chinese Government is itself desirous of entering into such an agreement.
                        The Department has, however, itself received no such intimations and would
                        be glad to have your comments on this matter.</p>
                    <p>2. In communications that have been exchanged between the War Department and
                        General Stilwell on this subject, General Stilwell has indicated his view
                        that any arrangement in the reverse lend-lease field should not affect his
                        freedom to procure equipment, services and supplies by methods other than
                        reverse lend-lease process or interfere with continuation of various
                        military works now being undertaken by the Chinese Government. We are in
                        complete agreement with General Stilwell on the foregoing matters and would
                        certainly ensure that his wishes be observed in any agreement that is
                        negotiated. Would you please talk with General Stilwell and ascertain
                        whether if his interests in these phases of the subject were ensured he
                        would have any objection to the conclusion of a reverse lend-lease
                        agreement. Will you also please point out to him that among the possible
                        specific advantages which might be derived from such an agreement,
                        consideration would be given to obtaining the agreement of the Chinese
                        Government that it would undertake to pay to our military establishment <pb n="523" xml:id="pg_523" facs="0533"/>in China, as a credit on reverse
                        lend lease, sufficient fapi to make up for the present disparity of the
                        dollar at the official rate of exchange. It is also quite possible that we
                        might propose to the Chinese Government that they cover other official
                        establishments in China of this Government on the same basis. We wish to be
                        sure that General Stilwell would see no objection to such action from a
                        military point of view.</p>
                    <p>3. Our own thought on this matter has been along the lines that a reverse
                        lend-lease agreement might be politically desirable. Such an agreement it
                        seems to us would have the advantage of bringing about an increased measure
                        of Chinese participation with us in joint war effort. If the Chinese
                        themselves are desirous that such an agreement be entered into we would be
                        inclined to welcome any suggestion from them to that effect.</p>
                    <p>4. Will you please send us such information as is available to you on the
                        above matters together with your views and recommendations.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Playfair called on Mr. Achilles by appointment to discuss matters
                        relating to reciprocal Lend-Lease for China. At Mr. Achilles’ request Mr.
                        Hiss participated in the conversation.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Playfair read from a telegram from Chungking which the British Embassy
                        has recently received. In this telegram it was stated that the British
                        Military Attaché at Chungking has been discussing with General Stilwell the
                        matter of reciprocal aid from China for American and British troops
                        stationed in China. It was further stated that the British Military Attaché
                        understood that this matter was under discussion in Washington between the
                        Chinese and the American Government. The statement was then made that bulk
                        articles, freight charges, personal services and the like would be supplied
                        by China but that personal out-of-pocket expenses of Allied troops would not
                        be covered. Statement was also made that the Chinese initiative in the
                        matter might be due to a desire to discourage the American demand for
                        improvement in the exchange rate as applied to American <pb n="524" xml:id="pg_524" facs="0534"/>troops in China or to the Chinese desire to
                        supervise more closely American military activities in China. The British
                        Military Attaché was said to be of opinion that it was important that
                        authority be clearly retained to make cash purchases in order to supplement
                        whatever aid the Chinese might agree to furnish, for the reason that Chinese
                        standards would be inadequate for proper maintenance and housing of British
                        soldiers.</p>
                    <p>In the course of conversation Mr. Playfair was told with respect to the
                        points referred to above that the Chinese have taken no initiative in this
                        matter in Washington, in fact no discussions of a reciprocal Lend-Lease
                        agreement have taken place with the Chinese in Washington, although the
                        matter has received consideration within this Government and we would
                        undoubtedly be pleased to discuss the matter at any time with the Chinese
                        were they to request us to do so; that we have had no information that
                        General Stilwell has in fact discussed with the Chinese an actual agreement
                        although we understand that in various instances the Chinese have offered as
                        an <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> matter to furnish certain things gratis;
                        that the British Military Attaché may wish to inquire of the War Department
                        as to arrangements now in force between General Stilwell and the Chinese
                        authorities with respect to American troops in China; that it appears likely
                        that the primary Chinese aim—whatever subsidiary motives may be present—in
                        offering supplies and services is to share in the common war effort; that it
                        seems likely that any reciprocal aid agreement which the United States may
                        enter into with China will not interfere with General Stilwell’s authority
                        to make cash purchases or to procure services for cash; and that it seems
                        questionable whether the issue of differing standards of maintenance would
                        be likely to arise under such an agreement for the reason that presumably
                        acquisition of supplies from China under reciprocal aid arrangements would
                        be bulk lots rather than of individual rations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Playfair said that he would be glad to communicate to the Department such
                        further information as the Embassy might receive in this matter and he said
                        that the Embassy would in turn appreciate being kept informed of our thought
                        on this subject.</p>

                    <p>127. Your 76, January 15, 7 p.m. I have discussed reverse Lend-Lease and
                        related problems with General Stilwell. He is agreeable to <pb n="525" xml:id="pg_525" facs="0535"/>reverse Lend-Lease agreement subject to
                        stipulation for his freedom and discretion to be able to secure supplies,
                        equipment and services locally from private or other agencies by nonreverse
                        Lend-Lease contracts or purchases whenever time or specifications make such
                        course appear to him advisable. In view of actual conditions in China I am
                        of the opinion that there will be frequent need of obtaining services,
                        supplies and equipment outside of reverse Lend-Lease.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell is concerned, as is this Embassy, regarding the spiraling of Chinese
                        prices and the fantastic United States currency equivalents at which reverse
                        Lend-Lease would be debited against United States at the present official
                        exchange rate.</p>
                    <p>The only direct indication I have had here of Chinese intention to adopt
                        reverse Lend-Lease is related to this matter of exchange rate. During recent
                        informal conversation with Foreign Minister I inquired whether there is any
                        basis for rumors that China proposes to adopt reverse Lend-Lease. He
                        explained that there has been considerable friction and difficulty with our
                        Army authorities over the charges for supplying food, lodging and services
                        of the hostels used by our troops. He said Chinese prices have risen so high
                        that when converted at official exchange rate the United States currency
                        payments for supplies and services provided might appear to be extortionate,
                        that Minister of Finance considers it inadvisable at this time to revise the
                        official exchange rate or to grant special rates, and that accordingly Soong
                        had recommended that China refuse payment for supplies and services being
                        provided and should regard them as reverse Lend-Lease.</p>
                    <p>Stilwell confirms that Chinese have now taken that position and says that
                        Generalissimo himself indicates that payment will not be accepted. Stilwell
                        has referred for instructions of War Department. He explained that
                        difficulty has arisen largely out of failure of Chinese Government agency
                        not [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to submit detailed break down of costs to
                        support prices they asked.</p>
                    <p>In my brief conversation with the Foreign Minister he appeared to favor
                        reverse Lend-Lease hot only to overcome situation mentioned above but also
                        for political reasons. The Minister of Finance and others however may not
                        have a similar far sighted view.</p>
                    <p>From a strictly confidential source I know that reverse Lend-Lease has also
                        had consideration in connection with the study of possible measures to
                        ameliorate situation regarding foreign exchange rate on which there has been
                        much complaint of unfairness from foreign military and diplomatic
                        establishments, relief and missionary organizations, and foreign residents
                        in China as well as from Chinese dependent upon remittances from their
                        relatives abroad.</p>
                    <p>Minister of Finance maintains that rate cannot be revised at this time
                        because of danger of effect on whole price structure and currency <pb n="526" xml:id="pg_526" facs="0536"/>situation, and there is equal
                        opposition to granting any special rates for special purposes as such
                        special rates could not be kept secret.</p>
                    <p>I understand that as to such organizations as United China Relief it is
                        proposed that Chinese Government grant subsidies of dollar for dollar
                        remittances received from abroad at the official rate.</p>
                    <p>I am informed in strictest confidence that as to military forces and perhaps
                        diplomatic establishments there has been some proposal that
                        inter-governmental arrangements be made under which the Chinese Government
                        would advance Chinese currency funds for their expenses, such advances to be
                        charged to reverse Lend-Lease or to be left for future settlement between
                        the Governments, with the rate of exchange left open for future decisions.
                        This expedient was proposed to avoid granting special rate. But I understand
                        this matter is complicated by the situation arising out of the use of United
                        States currency amongst our troops and the sale of United States currency
                        and Treasury checks by our military personnel in the black market. The
                        Chinese have been critical of this for some time but have avoided open
                        complaint because of possible adverse effect on morale of our Army
                        personnel. British are also critical; their personnel are forbidden to deal
                        in black market.</p>
                    <p>I am of opinion that if reverse Lend-Lease could be extended to cover Chinese
                        currency advances for expenses in China, something reasonable by way of
                        reverse Lend-Lease might be accomplished, and it should be possible to
                        devise means of avoiding use of United States currency and sale of such
                        currency and of Treasury checks in black market. Additional compensation,
                        and subsistence, per diem, cost of living, rent and other allowances could
                        be fixed and paid in Chinese currency and rates could be revised
                        periodically to meet rising living costs.</p>
                    <p>I recommend that we seek, or preferably encourage Chinese to propose, reverse
                        Lend-Lease agreement, with necessary reservations to meet Stilwell’s
                        stipulations, and that we endeavor to provide amongst other things for cash
                        advances in Chinese currency for official American Government expenses in
                        China, the amounts of such advances to be fixed in periodical requisition
                        every few months perhaps within certain limits. The agreement might provide
                        or it could be stipulated in a separate unpublished understanding that the
                        rate of exchange at which such Chinese currency advances as well as the
                        value of supplies, equipment and services furnished shall be debited against
                        the United States in the Lend-Lease accounts shall be settled later between
                        the two Governments, it being understood that this procedure is adopted to
                        avoid granting special exchange rates or revision of the official exchange
                        rate at this time. If and when such an arrangement is made, the use of
                        United States currency by our <pb n="527" xml:id="pg_527" facs="0537"/>Army
                        should be discontinued so far as possible and all Government personnel
                        should be forbidden to use the black market.</p>

                    <p>Colonel Pennoyer (who had attended a meeting on the above subject in Mr. Dean
                        Acheson’s office yesterday in which it was agreed that this Department would
                        proceed with the drafting of a reverse lend-lease agreement with China for
                        submission thereof to the War Department, the Treasury Department and the
                        Lend-Lease Administration) called at his request.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the telegram of January 19 from General Stilwell to the War
                            Department,<note n="15" xml:id="d448fn15">Not found in Department
                            files.</note> paraphrase of which had been circulated to interested
                        officers of the Department by Mr. Feis on January 22, Colonel Pennoyer said
                        that he thought the Department would be interested in the following
                        information: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>Assistant Secretary McCloy had first decided to reply to General
                                Stilwell’s telegram simply by directing him to accede to the Chinese
                                position. However, officers of the War Department who have been
                                handling the matter prevailed upon Mr. McCloy to change his decision
                                and instead he directed (I understood the revised decision was
                                arrived at yesterday) that General Stilwell be informed that reply
                                will be made to his telegram when Dr. Soong<note n="16" xml:id="d448fn16">T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign

                                be also informed that the War Department is consulting with the
                                State Department on the question under reference. Colonel Pennoyer
                                said that reply along these lines is to be dispatched to General
                                Stilwell today.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>Colonel Pennoyer went on to say that the Operations Division had been under
                        the impression that the State Department was applying pressure upon the War
                        Department for a reverse lend-lease agreement to be effected more or less
                        regardless of General Stilwell’s views. I replied that, on the contrary, we
                        had at all times fully appreciated the points on which General Stilwell
                        desired adequate safeguards and agreed with the General’s view on these
                        points. I repeated what Colonel Pennoyer had been told yesterday in Mr. Dean
                        Acheson’s office that so far there has been no official approach by the
                        Chinese for an agreement and that at present we are interested primarily in
                        working out a draft of an agreement which would help the various <pb n="528" xml:id="pg_528" facs="0538"/>agencies of this Government to meet their
                        problems relating to China—this includes primarily our armed forces in
                        China, and also the Treasury Department with its responsibility for the
                        Chinese Stabilization Board and black market operations, the various
                        purchasing agencies who acquire strategic materials from China, the Red
                        Cross and other relief agencies, the Lend-Lease Administration and our own
                        Foreign Service officers in China. When that stage is reached we will
                        consider, if the Chinese have still not approached us, the most effective
                        way of getting the question of an agreement raised between us and the
                        Chinese in the light of developments up to that time. I said that I might
                        state personally that I had been given to understand that the War Department
                        has been anxious that a reverse lend-lease be concluded promptly and that I
                        had rather felt that we were under some pressure from the War Department for
                        speed in this connection. Colonel Pennoyer said that this was not the
                        situation. He also said that he experienced great relief as a result of his
                        talks yesterday in Mr. Acheson’s office and this morning with me. He said
                        further that the Operations Division had perhaps been at fault for not
                        communicating previously directly with the Department, pointing out that Lt.
                        Col. Gaud, of the International Division of the War Department, who had
                        talked to Mr. Willoughby several times would be likely to take a somewhat
                        different view of the situation and might simply desire to get as many
                        reverse lend-lease agreements signed as possible and that it might be that
                        my impressions as to the War Department’s attitude had resulted from
                        statements made by Colonel Gaud.</p>
                    <p>As indication of the Department’s attitude I showed Colonel Pennoyer a copy
                        of our telegram No. 76 to Chungking, January 15, the reply to which (No.
                        127, of January 23) had been read to him yesterday by Mr. Acheson and copy
                        of which had this morning been sent in paraphrase to the War Department.
                        Colonel Pennoyer said that he was in entire agreement with the form and
                        substance of our telegram to Chungking and with the decisions reached
                        yesterday in Mr. Acheson’s office with regard to prompt drafting and
                        consideration of a draft agreement. He said that after the agreement was in
                        form satisfactory to the concerned agencies in Washington, General
                        Stilwell’s views could then be obtained again and final decision made as to
                        the way in which the question could be taken up with the Chinese.</p>

                        between this Government and the Chinese Government on reciprocal aid. Copies
                        of the draft are on their way to General Stilwell in as much as the War
                        Department wishes to make sure that the draft is satisfactory to him. War
                        Department has instructed General Stilwell to furnish you a copy.</p>
                    <p>The draft agreement contains reservations which, it is believed, will prove
                        satisfactory to General Stilwell. Provision is also made for advances in
                        Chinese currency to meet essential United States governmental as well as
                        military needs.</p>
                    <p>Several agencies of this Government have already signified their approval of
                        the draft and the approval of other interested agencies is being sought.</p>
                    <p>The Department will be glad to receive any additional information you may

                        1943, in regard to an agreement covering reciprocal aid, there are enclosed
                        copies of notes<note n="17" xml:id="d450fn17">Neither printed. The first
                            draft note was the same, except for a few minor changes, as that handed
                            to the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs on May 15, <ref target="#pg_538">p. 538</ref>. The second draft note was a reply

                    <p>For your information it may be stated that the text of the notes follows
                        closely the phraseology appearing in the agreement for reciprocal aid
                        negotiated with Great Britain.<note n="18" xml:id="d450fn18">Supplementary

                        governmental and military establishments of the United States in China. It
                        will be noted that the Government of the Republic of China agrees to provide
                        the United States, its armed forces and establishments with military
                        equipment, munitions, military and naval stores, other supplies, facilities

                        those forces and establishments may make apart from the arrangements covered
                        by the agreement”. It is believed that this reservation should adequately
                        meet General Stilwell’s stipulations and enable him to make such purchases
                        as he may desire for the American forces in China. Sub-section (<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) provides <pb n="530" xml:id="pg_530" facs="0540"/>for the advance of funds in Chinese currency to meet “other essential

                            Stilwell’s telegram to War Department. It is assumed that War Department
                            has made substance of the telegram available to the Department.<note n="19" xml:id="d451fn19">The War Department informed the Department

                                (893.24/1579).</note> Stilwell and other army officers here are not
                            favorably impressed by proposed agreement although Stilwell does not
                            reject it. He states that in its present form it will have little effect
                            on situation and that only an agreement which provides a realistic rate
                            of exchange will obtain practical relief for the military.</item>

                            serve the ends desired. Firstly, for political reasons we should have
                            such an agreement with China. Secondly, the American Treasury and tax
                            payer should be relieved of the financial charge which the present
                            unreasonable rate of exchange imposes—I refer to our Government’s
                            expenditures here in the form of allowances and per diems to officers
                            and employees and to excessive charges for rent and other services which
                            derive from the disparity between the actual purchasing value of the
                            Chinese dollar (less than 1 cent United States) and the exchange value
                            of 5 cents.</item>

                        <item>There would seem to be two practical ways in which the above mentioned
                            charges could be transferred from the American Treasury <pb n="531" xml:id="pg_531" facs="0541"/>to the Chinese Government under the
                            contemplated reverse Lend-Lease agreement without the necessity of
                            fixing a special rate. All allowances, per diems and charges for
                            services in Chinese currency could be paid from fund to be established
                            by Chinese Government and accounted for separately; that is, separately
                            from such basic charges as United States dollar salaries of officers and
                            employees, rent allowances and allowances for support of families in
                            United States, which would continue to be paid by American Government.
                            The Department and other civilian agencies of Government would continue
                            to grant allowances and per diems, stating them in Chinese currency, and
                            increase them as the purchasing power of Chinese dollar falls, as will
                            inevitably be the case. Payments for rent and other services in Chinese
                            currency would in a similar manner become a direct charge against
                            Chinese Government funds. Neither now nor later would there by [<hi rend="italic">be</hi>] any necessity to establish a special rate of
                            exchange. The other manner of handling the matter would be to charge all
                            payments made locally in Chinese currency, including salaries et cetera
                            to the Chinese Government fund, as I recall Dr. Soong suggesting, and
                            decide upon some equitable rate for settlement after termination of the
                            war.</item>

                        <item>I have discussed the matter with civilian officers of their branches
                            of the Government here and find them in general accord with Embassy’s
                            views. If practical the agreement should be made retroactive to January
                            1, 1942. The Embassy is preparing a proposed sliding scale to provide a
                            systematic basis for determining special allowances to meet rises in
                            cost of living.</item>

                        <item>I am not familiar with the Army’s problems, but it seems to me that a
                            system of allowances or per diems such as we and other civilian agencies
                            of the Government here have adopted could be adopted to the requirements
                            of army personnel in such a way as to obviate the necessity of fixing a
                            definite rate of exchange. I have not had an opportunity to discuss the
                            matter with General Stilwell who is in India.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>A reverse Lend-Lease agreement would of course leave unsolved the
                            problem of American eleemosynary remittances and remittances from
                            overseas Chinese and also financing problems of other officials in
                            China. The Department knows of the suggestion that the Ministry of
                            Finance match remittances dollar for dollar. There are rumors in
                            Chungking that Dr. Kung<note n="20" xml:id="d451fn20">H. H, Kung,
                                Chinese Minister of Finance.</note> plans to lower the rate of
                            exchange (30 to 1 is mentioned), but these rumors may derive from the
                            circumstance that the Ministry of Finance, I am confidentially informed,
                            is giving some consideration to the matter of granting a special rate
                            for diplomatic and foreign government establishments in China. <pb n="532" xml:id="pg_532" facs="0542"/>There is no assurance, however,
                            that such consideration will be translated into action.</item>

                    <p>527. With reference to final paragraph of my 492, April 5, noon, Dr. Kung in
                        response to approach from Belgian Ambassador (<hi rend="italic">Doyen</hi>
                        of the Diplomatic Corps) through Foreign Office, has reluctantly indicated
                        willingness to give a “subsidy” of 50 cents on the dollar to diplomatic
                        missions here as relief from exchange situation. He stipulates that there
                        shall be no publicity [and?] no “special diplomatic rate” fixed and that
                        word “subsidy” shall be used as indicating that step is purely voluntary on
                        part of Finance Ministry and not matter to be used as precedent for other
                        quarters.</p>
                    <p>Acting Foreign Minister in response to Belgian Ambassador’s objection to
                        ideas of “a subsidy to diplomatic missions”, offered the refined alteration
                        to “exchange subsidy” which the Belgian Ambassador accepted. The latter is
                        now endeavoring to obtain agreement of other chiefs of missions for report
                        back to Foreign Office.</p>
                    <p>Without making any commitment on our part I have discussed matter with
                        Belgian and British Ambassadors and with Acting Foreign Minister. I informed
                        the latter that use of the word “subsidy” in any context was most
                        inappropriate from standpoint of Chinese Government as well as diplomatic
                        [missions?]. He agreed. I told him and the two Ambassadors aforementioned
                        that I would have to submit the matter to my Government.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office is apparently not informed regarding our reciprocal
                        Lend-Lease plans and it is possible that neither is Dr. Kung. While I
                        perceive no reason why other diplomatic missions should not take what
                        exchange relief they can obtain, irrespective of the effect which a
                        reciprocal Lend-Lease agreement might have on our position, I desire the
                        Department’s instructions in the premises.</p>

                    <p>549. Reference my 527, April 11, 9 a.m. Ministry of Finance in a
                        communication signed by Dr. Kung has notified the Stabilization Board of the
                        Ministry’s proposal to grant a 50 cents on the dollar exchange allowance to
                        foreign diplomatic and consular establishments in China. The word “subsidy”
                        is not employed. The communication, somewhat lacking in precision with
                        regard to procedure and eventual accounting, requests the Board to give the
                        matter its attention.</p>

                    <p>692. To Secretary of the Treasury from Adler, TF–120. Re your 587, May 6,

                        conversion of foreign exchange by foreign Embassies and consular bodies
                        drafted by Ministry of Finance and communicated by it to Board on April

                                expenditures will be at the official rate and in addition an amount
                                equivalent to 50% of the proceeds in CN dollars will be paid.</item>
                            <item>2. The foreign exchange received from foreign Embassies and
                                consular bodies will be put in a separate account with Central Bank
                                and will not be credited to the account of Stabilization Board of

                        known whether Ministry of Finance contemplates a settlement of account
                        involving reverse Lend-Lease as far as United States and United Kingdom are

                        <item>Re your paragraph 2. Board in its reply to Ministry used following
                            formula deliberately to avoid indicating approval or disapproval “the
                            Board takes note of the proposal”. At same time Board is raising
                            questions of detail concerning proposed new arrangement implied
                            acceptance or consent in its reply.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Re your paragraph 3. Neither Board nor I went on record as agreeing
                            that 50% constitutes an adequate and reasonable compensation. At same
                            time in existing circumstances I feel that extra 50% for diplomatic and
                            consular bodies is better than nothing and can be regarded as opening
                            wedge. Embassy officials with whom I have maintained contact on the
                            matter do not disapprove of proposed arrangement.</item>

                        <item>Re your paragraph 4. Chinese colleagues inform me that Generalissimo
                            ordered Ministry of Finance to draft new arrangement as result of
                            complaints lodged by smaller Embassies and Legations in Chungking. There
                            is no further information to report on paragraph 2 of TF–118 of May 8

                        reciprocal lend-lease which it is contemplated might be addressed to the

                    <p>Mr. Acheson explained that we had exchanged similar notes with other
                        countries, as supplements to the formal lend-lease agreements, setting forth
                        the general types of reciprocal aid to be provided United States forces and

                        government to provide us with specified amounts of aid but simply described
                        the types of aid which would be offered. The amounts, of course, are
                        determined by the providing government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Acheson went on to explain that in the U.K., for example, aid has been
                        provided in two ways. The British have purchased equipment or materials and
                        turned them over to our forces, or our forces have done the procuring
                        themselves on British account. It has been found desirable, in some
                        instances, for the British to provide funds of their currency to facilitate
                        reciprocal aid. In the draft note submitted to Dr. Soong we have, in the
                        light of previous experience elsewhere and of special conditions existing in
                        China, made specific provision for currency to be received as reciprocal
                        aid. Mr. Acheson remarked that Dr. Soong was undoubtedly familiar with the
                        problem that our military has been called upon to face. American soldiers
                        have been taking the dollars they receive as pay and buying Chinese currency
                        on the black market. To police this would require as many soldiers again as
                        we already have in China. To correct this situation we would like, under the
                        terms of the proposed agreement, to be able to have our representatives in
                        China call upon the Chinese authorities, discuss their needs for special war
                        purposes, and receive from the <pb n="538" xml:id="pg_538" facs="0548"/>Chinese authorities whatever funds in Chinese dollars those authorities
                        felt they could provide as reciprocal aid. Then, as a separate transaction,
                        our representatives would turn over to Chinese authorities the dollars they
                        had planned to spend on salaries, et cetera, and the Chinese lend-lease
                        account would be credited to that extent.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong commented that this would avoid the problem of the exchange rate.
                        He went on to say that he was very glad to receive this draft and that he
                        hoped it would clarify many questions which now perplexed both Governments.
                        He said that he realized that the official exchange rate was out of line
                        with actual purchasing power, and that many American officers felt that they
                        were being “gypped”. So far as diplomatic establishments were concerned, he
                        had long ago suggested to the Generalissimo that a special rate be granted.
                        A special rate, however, has certain disadvantages from the domestic
                        viewpoint. Nevertheless, he understood that Dr. Kung has finally agreed to
                        offer a special exchange rate to diplomatic and consular services which will
                        be a fifty percent improvement over the official rate. Dr. Soong feels,
                        however, that the proposed agreement may offer a better solution.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that he would communicate it to his Government immediately and
                        hopes that he will be able to present us with a reply soon.</p>

                        1, 1942, the contracting governments pledged themselves to employ their full
                        resources, military and economic, against those nations with which they are
                        at war; and in the agreement of June 2, 1942 the Government of the Republic
                        of China and the Government of the United States undertook to provide each
                        other with such articles, services, facilities or information useful in the
                        prosecution of their common war undertaking as each might be in a position
                        to supply. It is further the understanding of the Government of the Republic
                        of China that the general principle to be followed in providing mutual aid
                        as set forth in the said Agreement of June 2, 1942 is that the war
                        production and the war resources of both Nations should be used by the armed
                        forces of each and of the other United Nations in ways which <pb n="539" xml:id="pg_539" facs="0549"/>most effectively utilize the available
                        materials, manpower, production facilities and shipping space.</p>

                        provision of aid by the Government of the Republic of China to the United
                        States and the manner in which such aid will be correlated with the

                    <p>In view of inquiries made by the British Finance Mission (Mr. Playfair) and
                        the Australian Legation (Mr. Brigden) some weeks ago as to whether we plan
                        to take any steps to alleviate the exchange difficulty which foreign
                        officials are subject to in Chungking, I telephoned to Mr. Grant (in Mr.
                        Play fair’s absence) and to Mr. Watt (in Mr. Brigden’s absence) after
                        discussing the question with FE, EU and A–A.</p>
                    <p>In both cases I recalled the previous inquiry, our previous statement that we
                        had the matter under consideration and hoped to propose to the Chinese some
                        ameliorative action under Lend-Lease arrangements, and then stated that on
                        Saturday last (May 15) Mr. Acheson had delivered to Dr. Soong a draft
                        reverse Lend-Lease Agreement containing a provision that as part of the
                        assistance to be supplied by China, the Chinese might furnish the American
                        armed forces and official establishments with needed amounts of Chinese
                        currency. I explained further that in so far as exchange difficulties were
                        concerned, it was our hope that this device would suffice to permit our
                        dollar expenditures in China to be assured of fuller purchasing power than
                        was possible at the official rate of exchange. I explained that in some
                        cases the proposed assistance by way of delivery of amounts of Chinese
                        currency might simply be in lieu of the direct delivery of materials or
                        services and in such cases would bear no relation to exchange difficulties
                        as such.</p>
                    <pb n="541" xml:id="pg_541" facs="0551"/>
                    <p>In each case I also requested that the information be regarded as
                        confidential and that no action be taken to approach the Chinese with any
                        similar plan until we had had an opportunity to ascertain the Chinese
                        reaction to our proposal. I said that it was our desire that the Chinese
                        consideration of our proposal not be complicated by the necessity for
                        simultaneous consideration of any similar proposal from other countries. In
                        both cases there was an expression of thanks for the information and an
                        assurance that any action vis-à-vis the Chinese would be held in abeyance
                        until further word from us.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Liu called on me at his request to receive an informal memorandum
                        clarifying certain aspects of the draft note on Chinese reciprocal aid
                        agreement, which was handed by Mr. Acheson to Dr. Soong on May 15, 1943. A
                        copy of this informal memorandum is attached.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu said that the memorandum seemed clear and would be most helpful to
                        his Government in considering the proposed agreement. Dr. Liu is planning to
                        telegraph the draft agreement and the informal memorandum to Chungking
                        immediately.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu observed that it was his understanding that the Chinese currency
                        turned over to United States authorities would not be earmarked for specific
                        purposes but could be used for the purchase of materials needed by the armed
                        forces or for wages or administrative expenses.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the conversation it was emphasized that the amounts of
                        Chinese currency to be received by United States authorities, and the
                        amounts of American dollars to be turned over to Chinese authorities, would
                        be the subject of joint consideration. Dr. Liu inquired whether this could
                        mean that no American dollars need be received by China. It was explained to
                        him that we definitely contemplated that American dollars would be provided
                        in connection with certain <pb n="542" xml:id="pg_542" facs="0552"/>categories of expenditures. Mr. Hiss also emphasized the fact that the
                        proposed agreement would not affect the purchases of strategic materials to
                        be exported from China by the Board of Economic Warfare or by the
                        Reconstruction Finance Corporation agencies.</p>

                  </p>
                        <p>The general theory underlying the so-called “reverse” Lend-Lease
                            Agreements is similar to the general theory underlying the master
                            Lend-Lease Agreements themselves. In both cases the agreements merely
                            provide general principles under which the war resources of the
                            contracting governments can be most effectively utilized for the joint
                            war effort. It is contemplated under both types of agreements that
                            specific transactions to be effectuated under the agreements will be
                            carried out on the basis of mutual agreement as to details.</p>
                        <p>In the draft of a proposed “reverse” Lend-Lease Agreement handed to Dr.
                            Soong by Mr. Acheson on May 15, 1943, provision is made for several
                            possible ways by which the government of the Republic of China may,
                            according to future circumstances as they arise, give assistance to the
                            armed forces and other official agencies of the United States
                            Government. Those various types of assistance may be roughly grouped as
                            follows: <list>
                                <label>1.</label>
                                <item>The direct supplying of materials or services for the use of
                                    the armed forces and establishments of the United States.</item>
                                <label>2.</label>
                                <item>The supplying of Chinese currency, such currency to be used by
                                    the armed forces and establishments of the United States in
                                    procuring supplies and services and for other payments by them
                                    in the areas under the control of the Government of the Republic
                                    of China. The United States would in turn from time to time
                                    deliver to the Chinese authorities amounts of United States
                                    dollars allotted for such procurement and for such other
                                    payments.</item>
                            </list>
                  </p>
                        <p>The specific terms and procedures to be followed with respect to
                            transactions of the above types would, of course, be worked out by
                            mutual agreement between the appropriate Chinese and American
                            authorities. It would be contemplated that with respect to the first
                            type of transaction the Chinese Government would be credited on
                            Lend-Lease account with the materials or the services supplied to the
                            United States. In the case of the second type of transaction it would be
                            contemplated that against the amounts of Chinese currency delivered to
                            the United States authorities in China, the Chinese Government would
                            receive dollars computed at the official rate of exchange <pb n="543" xml:id="pg_543" facs="0553"/>for such proportion of the total
                            Chinese currency delivered as shall be agreed upon from time to time and
                            that the remaining portion or quota of the Chinese currency so delivered
                            would be credited to the Chinese Government on Lend-Lease account.</p>
                        <p>It is, of course, to be understood that the whole nature of Lend-Lease
                            aid is one of voluntary not obligatory assistance. Lend-Lease Agreements
                            merely specify the general principles which it is agreed will be
                            followed in those cases in which the Government requested to supply
                            goods or services under the Agreement considers that it is in a position
                            to supply such goods or services. Lend-Lease Agreements do not, of
                            course, in any way prevent the continuance of other procedures of
                            procurement outside the scope of Lend-lease arrangements.</p>

                            not taking any action conformable to the Foreign Office note. Prior to

                            the purpose, <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>, seeking clarification of

                            “special rate” and foreign objection to a “subsidy” for diplomatic
                            establishments, it is our impression, received from conversation with
                            several foreign diplomatic representatives that they will hesitate to
                            accept the arrangement until the language of Article III is appreciably
                            modified or supplemented by written assurance that it covers only a
                            matter of mechanics between the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry
                            and does not create any financial obligation on the part of foreign

                        <item>Saw Dr. Kung on 19th. He informed me of his interview with
                            representatives of foreign missionary and philanthropic organizations
                                <pb n="545" xml:id="pg_545" facs="0555"/>in Chengtu indicating that
                            he had agreed to match foreign contributions for famine relief and to
                            grant the official rate plus 50% for foreign missionary philanthropic
                            and educational expenditures. He added that this arrangement and the
                            arrangement with respect to foreign Embassies and consular bodies did
                            not signify the establishment of special rates for special purposes nor
                            did they signify the granting of subsidies. But it would appear that
                            however the arrangement will be dressed up they will constitute special
                            rates for special purposes in fact if not in name however their status
                            remains ambiguous pending further clarification.</item>

                        <item>I understand Central Bank has already received instructions concerning
                            the arrangement with respect to foreign missionary etc. organizations
                            but Board has not yet been officially notified.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>There is one aspect of the proposed new arrangement with respect to
                            foreign missionary etc. organizations to which I feel your attention
                            should be called. While the arrangement with respect to foreign
                            Embassies etc. does not involve large amounts of foreign exchange and
                            can be regarded as exceptional case the proposed arrangement with
                            respect to foreign missionary etc. organizations would involve
                            substantial amounts of foreign exchange. The fact that under proposed
                            arrangement the substantial amount of foreign exchange involved would
                            accrue solely to the Central Bank would appear to entail an encroachment
                            on the effective functioning of the Board. While of course in the
                            absence of anything better there can be no objection to granting foreign
                            missionary etc. organizations the official rate plus 50% there are
                            grounds for preferring an arrangement which would achieve this purpose
                            and at the same time allow the Board to continue to be the recipient of
                            foreign exchange from remittances to foreign missionary, etc.
                            organizations. It would be appreciated therefore if you could inform me
                            of Treasury’s attitude to the proposed arrangement before the matter
                            formally comes up before the Board. [Adler.]</item>

                        <item>In the course of a conversation on various subjects with Dr. Kung late
                            on May 22, he described at some length but in vague terms the reasons
                            including appreciation of the American loan which had motivated <pb n="546" xml:id="pg_546" facs="0556"/>the Chinese Government in
                            devising the new special exchange regulations. While I did not obtain
                            from him a very precise clarification of article 3 of the regulations,
                            he stated that it concerned the Central Bank and his Ministry and that
                            there was no intention to create any debt on the part of foreign
                            governments. (A more specific clarification was given an officer of the
                            Embassy by Mr. K. K. Kwok, general manager of the Central Bank of China,
                            who stated that the foreign Embassies definitely incur no
                            responsibilities whatsoever under article 3; that the article simply
                            covers a matter of mechanics between the Central Bank and the Ministry;
                            that the “settlement” referred to is to be only between the Bank and the
                            Ministry; and that he was somewhat surprised that the text of the
                            article had been transmitted to the Embassy by the Foreign
                            Office.)</item>

                            mention the subject. As regards the special exchange regulations, I said

                    <p>790. Embassy’s 768, May 24, 3 p.m., special exchange regulations. Adler
                        informs us that the Stabilization Board has tacitly approved the new special
                        exchange regulations for foreign Embassies and consular offices by “taking
                        note” of them and not raising our [<hi rend="italic">any</hi>] nation [<hi rend="italic">objection</hi>] to them and also by requesting Ministry of
                        Finance to instruct Central Bank to report to the Board monthly exchanges
                        sold to and bought from foreign Embassies and consular offices. In the light
                        of this circumstance and as article 3 has been clarified, we assume that, in
                        the absence of instructions to the contrary and pending the making of other
                        possible arrangements, we may take advantage of new rate which benefits the
                        Government and brings much needed, if only temporary, relief to members of
                        the staff.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that British and other foreign diplomatic missions are
                        similarly availing themselves of the new rate.</p>

                    <p>While the benefits to be enjoyed under the new exchange regulations are of a

                        than 10% a month and is expected to be accelerated as a result of the
                        current Jap military operations in the Hunan-Hupeh area, the additional
                        funds to be availed of under the regulations would materially lower the
                        Government’s expenditures for rent, et cetera and would provide Government
                        personnel with much desired financial relief. Also, use by us of the new
                        arrangements would provide an opening wedge for a later and more
                        satisfactory adjustment (through reverse Lend-Lease or a lowering of the
                        official rate) of the exchange problem.</p>

                            which will probably not take place till next week owing to chairman’s

                        <item>Mr. K. K. Kwok of Central Bank informs me that a similar arrangement
                            is to be extended to foreign military officers and foreign journalists.
                            NB. <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. It will be difficult to refuse all other

                            as most American soldiers and journalists convert their foreign exchange

                            and as to whether it will be extended to overseas remittances. It would
                            appear that it is only a matter of time before Chinese Government will
                            have to make same concession to overseas Chinese.</item>

                            attention to fact that it would be absurd to give diplomats official
                            rate plus 50% and allow them to get foreign exchange at official rate.
                            Ministry therefore agreed that diplomats should henceforth apply to
                            Central Bank for foreign exchange which they would pay at same rate as
                            they received it and Ministry will presumably impose same requirement on

                                    position of Board would become difficult. While November 1, 1941
                                    Agreement and paragraph 4 of General License 75 would require
                                    reconsideration in light of changed circumstances, major
                                    question would be what would be the function if any of the Board
                                    in a situation in which major part of foreign exchange business
                                    would be handled by Central Bank at official rate plus 50%
                                    completely independently of Board and in which amount of

                    <p>Section II. 1. Had a long informal conversation with Dr. Kung on the 27th
                        when he discussed foreign exchange situation with me. He indicated that
                        pressure had been put on him to make adjustments for foreign diplomats,
                        missionaries, et cetera. He could do so in one of three ways: <list>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                            <item>He could recommend a reduction in official rate. But he was not
                                convinced that a reduction to say 40 was in best interests of China.
                                (This is the mildest expression he has yet used re a reduction in
                                rate his attitude toward which was much less intransigent than
                                formerly.)</item>

                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                            <item>He could grant official rate plus 50% and have whole arrangement
                                handled by Board which would receive the 50% from Ministry of
                                Finance just as Central Bank will under arrangements actually
                                adopted or in course of adoption. (This answers point 1 of your 587,
                                May 6 and clarifies section 1 paragraph 3 of TF–120, May 12,<note n="37" xml:id="d469fn37">Telegrams No. 587, May 6, 6 p.m., and

                                it would be embarrassing to Board to do a large part of its business
                                at 30 while official rate was maintained at 20. He had therefore
                                decided on third alternative, namely:</item>
                            <label>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>)</label>
                            <item>To grant various foreign organizations and individuals official
                                rate plus 50% but to have all such transactions handled by Central
                                Bank. He emphasized repeatedly that this arrangement was <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> and temporary and could be abandoned
                                if found to be unsatisfactory in practice. It existed on a 24 hour
                                basis and could be immediately scrapped if unsuccessful.</item>
                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>With respect to the position of Board, Dr. Kung pooh-poohed an article
                        appearing in April Central Bank bulletin (forwarded by pouch)<note n="38" xml:id="d469fn38">Not reprinted.</note> which stated that retention of
                        foreign representatives on Board was inconsistent with abolition of inequal
                        treaties and advocated fusion of Stabilization Board with Foreign Exchange
                        Control Commission. Dr. Kung made it clear that this article did not express
                        official attitude of Chinese Government. I called his attention to need for
                        tightening up supervision of sales of United States dollar backed savings
                        certificates in order to prevent foreigners receiving <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> at 30 from buying certificates at 20. He thanked me for
                        raising point and said it would be attended to. He concluded by promising to
                        review situation with me again in near future.</p>
                    <p>2. While there is no doubt that Dr. Kung was sincere in stating that Chinese
                        Government wished Board to continue to exist, in situation which would arise
                        if most foreign exchange transactions would be handled by Central Bank
                        independently of Board at official rate plus 50%, Board would be faced with
                        danger of extinction through atrophy. In Chungking Chinese members of Board
                        cannot take initiative in differing from positions taken by Chinese
                        Government. It is not too much to say that Board derives its strength solely
                        from support you and British Treasury are prepared to give it. At least one
                        and probably two of Chinese members would welcome concrete manifestation of
                        such support at this juncture.</p>
                    <p>In view of Board’s predicament and on basis of above and other conversations
                        with Dr. Kung I wish to report my impression that Treasury’s opinions would
                        carry weight and would at least strengthen position of Board if Treasury
                        found it expedient to express its attitude <pb n="551" xml:id="pg_551" facs="0561"/>on following to Minister of Finance either through Chinese

                                rate—say to 40—on grounds that official rate grossly overvalues <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> and that procedures now being adopted by
                                Chinese Government create unnecessary complications and anomalies
                                such as indicated in section I, paragraph 5 above, all arising from
                                fact that Chinese Government is trying to change rate without
                                changing it.</item>

                    <p>The War Department representatives expressed doubt that the Chinese
                        Government would be able to meet General Stilwell’s Reverse Lend-Lease
                        Chinese currency needs for the pay of Army personnel and for other purposes,
                        including especially construction projects, and they considered that the
                        purposes other than pay should have priority even though this well might
                        mean that despite the receipt of large amounts of <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> by the U. S. Army, our troops would still utilize the black
                        market for exchange of their pay. The War Department representatives stated
                        that most projects would involve mainly the furnishing of labor for which
                        such currency would not necessarily be required<note n="40" xml:id="d472fn40">Marginal notation: “i. e., if labor conscripted or
                            paid by Chinese.”</note> but they felt confident that U. S. Army
                        expenditures in China would greatly increase and that pay of troops would
                        constitute only a relatively small portion of the total. They said that it
                        would be difficult to make any firm commitment to use the <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> received for troop pay, observing that because of inflation
                        even the transportation of the currency to certain remote areas would be a
                        major problem. It would be difficult also to estimate in advance currency
                        needs for a given period, and in the event of major operations the amount
                        required might greatly exceed what had been anticipated <pb n="553" xml:id="pg_553" facs="0563"/>and what the Chinese could supply. Even
                        should the amount prove sufficient both for pay and other purposes there
                        would be occasions when it would be expedient to use American dollars
                        instead of Chinese currency (even if available) for projects.</p>
                    <p>One of the points most strongly stressed by the representatives of the War
                        Department was their conclusion that present budget allotments for U. S.
                        military expenditures in China will prove insufficient in view of the
                        continuing spiral of inflation. General Carter said that he was not
                        considering the high policy question of how much should be spent in China as
                        compared to the magnitude of our efforts in other areas, but merely the
                        question of how much is available for China without going back to Congress
                        and asking for more money on the ground that costs in China are “twenty
                        times” what they are elsewhere. It was said that General Stilwell has
                        recently reported on several occasions that the Chinese are “getting away
                        with” a good deal in the matter of prices.… General Carter said that the War
                        Department is consequently anxious to get as much Reverse Lend-Lease aid
                        from China as possible.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the discussion the War Department representatives stated
                        that, although General Stilwell agreed in principle that Reverse Lend-Lease
                        currency should be applied first to the pay of his troops, he could not be
                        rigidly committed on this point, as military exigencies might require the
                        use of so much of the available currency for projects that the amount left
                        would be inadequate to pay the troops. While recognizing the desirability of
                        his troops’ abandoning the black market, he considered the morale of his men
                        to be of major importance and that their morale could not be maintained
                        unless they were permitted to have recourse to the black market or received
                        amounts in Chinese currency comparable to what they could obtain on the
                        black market. In other words, General Stilwell was prepared to do his best
                        to carry out the proposed Reverse Lend-Lease arrangement, but he could not
                        afford to have his hands tied to the extent specified in the “Memorandum of
                            Principles”.<note n="40a" xml:id="d472fn42">Draft memorandum prepared by

                        [This paragraph represents the net position of the War Department
                        representatives progressively reached in the course of a prolonged
                        discussion. In particular, the “agreement in principle” reflected in the
                        first sentence was not expressed at the early part of the meeting.]<note n="41" xml:id="d472fn41">Brackets appear in the original.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>It was pointed out to the War Department representatives that the only
                        restriction on General Stilwell which was contemplated was the requirement
                        that he use the available Chinese currency first for the payment of his
                        troops, and that, if he did not receive enough for them, <pb n="554" xml:id="pg_554" facs="0564"/>he would of course be justified in allowing
                        his men to resort to the black market. It was generally agreed that it
                        should be understood that provision of sufficient <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> to permit adequate compensation of personnel would be a
                        condition of the whole arrangement in so far as agreement to keep American
                        troops out of the black market is concerned.</p>
                    <p>The War Department representatives raised the point that the adequacy of the
                        proposed compensation factor to be fixed by the Treasury might not prove
                        acceptable to General Stilwell, and it was agreed that in this event the
                        whole scheme would have to be abandoned.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out to the War Department representatives that the whole
                        arrangement was also dependent upon what the Chinese would accept; that the
                        Chinese were naturally sensitive to our troops resorting to the black
                        market; that we had already indicated to Dr. T. V. Soong that the proposed
                        arrangement could be expected to put an end to this practice; and that the
                        Chinese, mindful that what they granted to us would have to be granted to
                        other governments, would probably not accept the arrangement if this were
                        not the case.</p>
                    <p>At one point General Carter suggested tentatively that in order to minimize
                        black market operations it might be well to request the Chinese Government
                        to make dollar currency illegal in specified areas. [However it is believed
                        that after further consideration, the War Department would conclude that
                        such action would probably not be desirable from the viewpoint of the War
                        Department as it would tend to interfere with General Stilwell’s desire to
                        retain freedom to operate outside the agreement.]<note n="41a" xml:id="d472fn43">Brackets appear in the original.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Mr. Hiss then reviewed in broad terms what the Department of State would like
                        to be able to propose to the Chinese, including an undertaking that,
                        provided the Chinese fulfilled their obligations, American military and
                        government personnel would except in cases of clear military exigency not
                        patronize the black market, although General Stilwell would reserve the
                        right to make official purchases and contracts apart from the agreement.
                        General Carter stated that he was inclined to favor the proposition as so
                        stated in general terms, but that the War Department objected to the rigid
                        and mandatory character of the phraseology employed in the “Memorandum of
                        Principles” submitted by the Office of Lend-Lease Administration. It was
                        finally agreed that Mr. Hiss would revise the phraseology in question with a
                        view to meeting if possible the War Department’s desires.</p>
                    <p>At the request of those present, Mr. Ballantine then briefly discussed the
                        broader political factors involved.</p>

                        We are reliably informed that the proposed reverse Lend-Lease agreement
                        received favorable discussion at a recent Executive Yuan meeting. Neither
                        Dr. Kung, whom I have seen frequently, nor any other Chinese official has so
                        far mentioned the matter of a possible reverse Lend-Lease agreement to

                        <item>Under the contemplated procedure the Secretary of the Treasury will
                            fix a compensation factor to be used as the basis for determining the
                            amount of Chinese currency to be paid as compensation adjustment with
                            respect to civilian salaries and troop pay. It is understood that as a
                            practical matter the Treasury Department will take into account all
                            appropriate factors and opinions including, of course, the opinions of
                            the appropriate military authorities and appropriate representatives of
                            the other civilian agencies interested. It is to be understood that if
                            General Stilwell should not be satisfied that the compensation
                            adjustment computed on the foregoing basis was adequate for any given
                            period of time, the operation of this part of the proposed arrangements
                            would in fact not be practical. Since the entire purpose of this
                            category of the proposed reverse lend-lease currency arrangements is to
                            ease the exchange difficulties of Americans officially stationed in
                            China, of whom the great majority are Army personnel, General Stilwell
                            must maintain freedom of action to determine whether the proposed
                            exchange relief measures constitute in fact an improvement or an
                            impairment of the present status of his forces and to accept or reject
                            relief accordingly.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The Department of State considers that in order to be in position to
                            request the Chinese Government to advance currency for the purpose under
                            reference, the Government of the United States will for its part have to
                            be able to give assurances that, provided sufficient Chinese currency is
                            obtained to make a reasonable adjustment of the compensation of American
                            official personnel and American forces stationed in China and subject to
                            the imperative requirements of major military exigencies (which are not
                            now in fact foreseen as likely to arise), the United States Government
                            will take steps reasonably calculated to prevent American official
                            personnel from resorting to the so-called “black market”. To this end,
                            subject to the conditions recited in the preceding sentence, it is
                            anticipated that the payment of salaries and troop pay in currency other
                            than Chinese currency will be discontinued or appropriate <pb n="557" xml:id="pg_557" facs="0567"/>safeguards will be established to
                            insure that any such payments made in United States currency can be
                            exchanged only under such conditions as will not unduly hamper the
                            efforts of the Chinese Government to control the “black market”.
                            Similarly it is to be anticipated that steps will be taken to see to it
                            that such remittances or allotments as American official personnel may
                            make of their own funds from China will be on a basis which is in accord
                            with the foregoing.</item>

                        <item>It is anticipated that Chinese currency made available under reverse
                            lend-lease in amounts additional to the requirements for compensation
                            adjustment will be utilized primarily by authorized representatives of
                            the United States Army for such official purposes as the Army may deem
                            proper in connection with its activities in China. The civilian agencies
                            will also desire to utilize certain of these funds for official
                            purposes, for example payment of rent and acquisition of
                            supplies—especially the payment of rent. It is understood that in any
                            instances in which currency of the category under reference is utilized
                            without any concomitant expenditure of United States dollars, the
                            articles acquired or benefits received by the United States in return
                            for such expenditure shall in fact be regarded as a complete Chinese
                            contribution under reverse lend-lease. It is understood that, so far as
                            the Army now sees, all of the Chinese currency received by the Army for
                            category II purposes will be utilized only in conjunction with the
                            expenditure of the United States dollars in China and such Chinese
                            currency will be regarded by the War Department as merely in the nature
                            of exchange adjustment supplied by the Chinese Government, the Chinese
                            Government to receive credit, in terms of Chinese currency, on its
                            lend-lease account simply for the currency furnished by it, final
                            adjustment of the lend-lease accounts to be made at some future date
                            after the termination of the war.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>It is understood that, subject only to major military exigencies
                            (which exigencies are not in fact now foreseen), Chinese currency
                            received under reverse lend-lease will be used for category II purposes
                            only to the extent that such currency is available over and above the
                            requirements for compensation adjustment (category I). This limitation
                            is not a limitation upon any existing authority of General Stilwell’s.
                            It is merely a definition of the nature of an additional facility that
                            it is proposed will be made available to the United States Army in
                            China. With the exceptions envisaged in this memorandum, the <pb n="558" xml:id="pg_558" facs="0568"/>limitation does not restrict General
                            Stilwell’s freedom of action. Without the limitation the Department of
                            State seriously doubts the possibility of working out any satisfactory
                            arrangement; with the limitation there becomes possible the adoption of
                            a broad arrangement which would be of significant benefit to the Army
                            not only in the field of troop pay but also in the general field of
                            procurement and construction. This limitation is moreover, of course,
                            subject to change by agreement between appropriate American and Chinese
                            authorities and is, furthermore, to be interpreted in the light of
                            actual circumstances as they arise. For example, if it should happen
                            that Chinese currency received under reverse lend-lease is available in
                            amounts insufficient to meet requirements of compensation adjustment for
                            any particular period, it would be expected that the proposed
                            arrangements as to compensation allowances would be inoperative so far
                            as the Army is concerned for such period and it might be that the
                            Chinese authorities would have no objections to the utilization of such
                            currency for purposes other than compensation allowances.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>In general it is to be emphasized that the primary purpose of the
                            currency provisions of the proposed agreement (and indeed of the entire
                            agreement) is to provide an extremely flexible framework under which the
                            United States Army authorities in China by process of agreement with
                            appropriate Chinese officials can arrange for the progressive

                        lend-lease currency requirements under categories I and II, to present a
                        request for a “lump-sum” total amount of Chinese currency to the Chinese
                        authorities and to receive such currency as is subsequently made available
                        by the Chinese Government. It is understood that there is general agreement
                        among the interested agencies that reverse lend-lease currency received from
                        China shall constitute a “reciprocal aid fund” and that the necessary

               </p>
                    <p>It is felt that the War Department’s present intentions with respect to
                        utilization of Chinese reverse lend-lease currency for construction
                        projects, purchase of materials, etc. may not prove practicable. It is <pb n="559" xml:id="pg_559" facs="0569"/>understood that the War Department
                        contemplates that there would be no uniform rule as to the amounts of
                        Chinese reverse lend-lease currency to be so utilized—in one project such
                        currency may represent 10 percent of the total costs in China, in another 20
                        percent, and so on. The Army’s present intention is understood to be to
                        estimate what the project would cost in the United States, allocate a
                        corresponding amount of United States dollars for it and then utilize
                        Chinese reverse lend-lease currency to such extent as may be necessary to
                        carry out the project. If China could be frankly credited with having
                        furnished under reverse lend-lease that proportion of the completed project
                        represented by the proposition of Chinese reverse lend-lease currency to the
                        total cost (the Chinese currency to be computed at some basis similar to the
                        “compensation factor” mentioned under category I), the proposal would, it is
                        believed, be made more attractive to the Chinese. To insist that the Chinese
                        contribution in this category as in category I is merely in the nature of
                        exchange adjustment and hence has no measurable value, while at the same
                        time determining the Chinese contribution by factors not specially related
                        to exchange questions, is likely to seem arbitrary to the Chinese and may
                        not be acceptable to them. On the basis of its present understanding the
                        State Department would find it difficult to justify the War Department’s
                        proposal to the Chinese because the anticipated lack of uniformity in
                        application of the proposal minimizes its relationship to exchange
                        adjustments.</p>

                    <p>In response to a call which Colonel Foster had made yesterday in my absence,
                        I telephoned to him today.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Foster said that the War Department had given study to the memorandum
                        of July 8 on Reverse Lend Lease which the Department had sent to him about
                        July 20 and wish to consult General Stilwell. He said that he had in mind
                        sending by telegram a summary of the memorandum and of the War Department’s
                        comments thereon. He wondered whether there would be time also to send a
                        complete text of the memorandum and the War Department’s comments to the
                        General.</p>
                    <p>In reply I said that the Chinese might take the matter up with us at any time
                        and that consequently it was impossible to make any satisfactory estimate of
                        the time element. Colonel Foster indicated that he would send the telegram
                        he had in mind and would in addition send <pb n="560" xml:id="pg_560" facs="0570"/>the full text by pouch but would not count upon a
                        sufficient delay ensuing to permit General Stilwell to do more than reply by
                        telegram to the telegraphic communication.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Foster read portions of his proposed message to General Stilwell
                        which indicated general agreement by the War Department with the views
                        expressed in the Department’s memorandum of July 8. In the portions which he
                        read to me statement was made that General Stilwell would be expected to
                        give priority to troop pay to the extent that adequate Chinese currency was
                        received for such pay and American military personnel were to be prevented
                        from frequenting the “black market” and from investing in the Chinese dollar
                        certificates with the extra Chinese currency made available to them. It was,
                        however, also expressly stated that General Stilwell’s freedom of action was
                        not to be restricted and that in the event of military necessity he would
                        not be bound rigidly to adhere to these procedures. Statement was also made
                        that with regard to use of Chinese currency for contract purposes, the War
                        Department contemplates estimating the total cost of a proposed purchase,
                        construction, or other contract expenditure and would then be prepared to
                        pay to China an amount of United States dollars computed on the basis of the
                        compensation factor which the Treasury Department is to determine with
                        respect to civilian salaries and troop pay. Colonel Foster explained that
                        this represented a change in the War Department’s views (it is to be noted
                        that this change involves a matter as to which the Department expressed
                        adverse comment in the last two pages of the memorandum of July 8). Colonel
                        Foster went on to say that the army would not wish to have any confusion as
                        to a proportionate ownership of any article or facility acquired by it with
                        Chinese currency received through Reverse Lend-Lease. Consequently it had
                        not been considered advisable to adopt in full the suggestion made in the
                        concluding comment contained in the Department’s memorandum. However, it had
                        seemed desirable to adopt some uniform procedure. Colonel Foster also said
                        that in the case of any procurement item which the Chinese were prepared to
                        finance <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>, the Chinese would of course be given
                        entire credit under Lend-Lease for such item (I gathered the impression that
                        Colonel Foster contemplates that items of this kind would be acquired or
                        constructed by the Chinese authorities and then made available to our forces
                        and that all procurement by our forces with Chinese currency received
                        through Reverse Lend-Lease would be on the basis outlined above of a
                        proportionate dollar payment, the Chinese contribution being regarded simply
                        as exchange adjustment and not as a substantive contribution).</p>
                    <p>I asked Colonel Foster whether he had planned to suggest that General
                        Stilwell consult the Embassy. In reply he said that he <pb n="561" xml:id="pg_561" facs="0571"/>thought it would be helpful if he were to
                        add a sentence informing General Stilwell that the latter should feel free
                        to discuss the telegram with the Embassy and with the Treasury
                        representative at Chungking.</p>

                        <item>Arthur Young<note n="43" xml:id="d476fn43">American adviser to the
                                Chinese Ministry of Finance.</note> has come to see me on his own
                            initiative to discuss the question of reverse Lend-Lease. He stated that
                            in his capacity of adviser to the Ministry of Finance he has been urging
                            upon Dr. Kung and other concerned officials favorable consideration of
                            the matter and that in general the attitude of these officials has been
                            favorable. He said that the chief apparent obstacle at present was a
                            fear in some Chinese quarters that if and when China should become a
                            major base of operations against Japan and we should have in China large
                            numbers of American troops China would be giving us under reverse
                            Lend-Lease much more than China had received or would be receiving. Dr.
                            Young indicated also that he was interested in learning whether it was
                            the American concept that reverse Lend-Lease would involve the
                            furnishing by China of strategic materials. Having in mind the draft
                            enclosed with the Department’s instruction 250, March 17, the second
                            substantive paragraph of Department’s 649 [<hi rend="italic">659</hi>],
                            May 24,<note n="44" xml:id="d476fn44">Not printed, but see footnote 29,
                                    <ref target="#pg_541">p. 541</ref>.</note> and third paragraph
                            of message to Fowler from OEW<note n="45" xml:id="d476fn45">Office of

                        <hi rend="italic">Post</hi>, <ref target="#pg_653">p. 653</ref>.</note> I said that I did not think that the
                            furnishing of strategic materials by China was contemplated under
                            reverse Lend-Lease; that in general reverse Lend-Lease was entirely
                            voluntary and my understanding was that the obligations of the other
                            party in such arrangements with us were to be considered as naturally
                            limited by the other countries’ capacities and potentialities; thus it
                            seemed to me, speaking personally, that under the terms of the proposed
                            agreement and within the framework of the general concept China could by
                            entering into such an agreement enjoy the obvious political benefits
                            thereof and still retain final discretion as to amount of reverse
                            Lend-Lease to be furnished.</item>

                        <item>Mr. Fowler of OEW has since receipt of Department’s 752 several times
                            asked what progress was being made towards effecting a reverse
                            Lend-Lease agreement with China. I have the impression that the <pb n="562" xml:id="pg_562" facs="0572"/>message in question influenced
                            Fowler to feel that if and when any subsidiary or other conversations
                            with Chinese officials should take place here in regard to the matter,
                            he would be involved as one of the American negotiators. On July 25, Mr.
                            Lucker of OEW, who has just arrived, stated that before he left
                            Washington, he was told by Department to consult me as to what progress
                            had been made with Chinese in the matter. He said the Secretary of State
                            and the Chinese Ambassador had had a number of discussions of it and
                            also that he had seen a memorandum indicating that the question of the
                            furnishing of strategic materials was entirely without the purview of
                            the proposed agreement. (Mr. Fowler on the other hand has put forth his
                            firm opinion that the furnishing of strategic materials is necessarily
                            and must be part of China’s obligations under a reverse Lend-Lease
                            agreement.)</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>As will be obvious from the above the Embassy is in a somewhat awkward
                            position. We have not received from Department information in regard to
                            what if any developments have taken place in Washington subsequent to
                            those described in Department’s 649 [<hi rend="italic">659</hi>]. I have
                            no desire to interject the Embassy prematurely into a matter that is
                            assumably under negotiation in Washington but unavoidable circumstances
                            are, as indicated, getting us involved in it to some extent. Arthur
                            Young states that he is coming to see me again in the matter in a few
                            days and I should like, unless Department perceives objection, to be in
                            a position to tell him definitely whether or not the question of the
                            purchase of strategic materials (as well as the question of
                            transportation costs for strategic materials mentioned by OEW in
                            Department’s 752) is involved. I may add that I think a fair possibility
                            of facilitating the matter rests to an appreciable extent upon Young, as
                            the Finance Minister has asked him to study the matter and Young himself
                            is favorably disposed toward the proposal, and especially as Dr. Soong
                            is now absent from Washington.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>As for Mr. Fowler’s connection with the matter, I may say
                            confidentially and frankly that while I consider that he is, as an
                            experienced businessman, capable and effective in his procurement and
                            related activities I would envisage almost certain crossing of the wires
                            if he should continue to receive instructions which lead him to believe
                            that it will devolve upon him to “negotiate” with Chinese officials in
                            regard to the conclusion of a reverse Lend-Lease agreement. If such
                            agreement is concluded and if it should involve furnishing by Chinese of
                            strategic materials or the payment of transportation costs therefor,
                            participation by Mr. Fowler in the later working out of pertinent
                            technical details would, of course, seem to be appropriate and
                            essential.</item>

                            when the agreement is entered into, the question of placing thereunder
                            certain inland transportation costs of strategic materials. Please make

                        <item>Department and other interested agencies have from the outset
                            contemplated that actual purchases of strategic materials from China
                            would not be covered by the proposed agreement, and the Counselor of the
                            Chinese Embassy was so informed orally in the conversation described in
                            Department’s 659, May 24, 9 p.m. You may so inform Mr. Arthur Young and
                            Mr. Fowler pointing out at the same time that the entire concept of
                            lend-lease agreements is that they are entirely Voluntary and that
                            agreements on this subject merely set forth general principles to be
                            followed by the parties thereto, details of actual transfers to be
                            worked out subsequently by mutual agreement between the appropriate
                            foreign and American authorities.</item>

                        <item>Department has experienced difficulties and delays in reaching full
                            understanding with other interested agencies as to accounting procedures
                            to be followed under proposed reverse lend-lease agreement. In view of
                            the novelty and complexity of the proposed exchange and currency
                            arrangements, this is not surprising and Department is inclined to be
                            encouraged by the progress already reached toward unanimity. On or about
                            July 20 Department presented to the <pb n="564" xml:id="pg_564" facs="0574"/>War Department an informal memorandum dated July 8
                            which had been previously informally approved by Lend-Lease
                            Administration and the Treasury Department. This memorandum set forth
                            the Department’s understanding as to the principles which are to govern
                            the disposition and use of Chinese currency which may be received under
                            the proposed reverse lend-lease agreement. Department has in the past
                            few days been informed informally that the War Department is in general
                            agreement with the understanding set forth in the memorandum and that a
                            summary of the memorandum together with the War Department’s comments is
                            being sent by telegram to General Stilwell who is being authorized to
                            discuss the matter with the Embassy and with the Treasury representative
                            at Chungking. The substance of the present informal agreement among the
                            interested agencies is more or less along the lines with which the
                            Chargé was familiar before he left Washington. It is proposed that
                            Chinese currency furnished under reverse lend-lease will be asked for
                            and received in a lump sum. Subject to military exigencies the currency
                            so received will in the first instance be utilized as compensation
                            adjustment for the salaries of American civilian officials in China and
                            the pay of American armed forces in China, the amount of the
                            compensation adjustment to be computed by the Treasury Department under
                            existing statutory authority. Additional Chinese currency received as
                            reverse lend-lease aid will be utilized, presumably on the basis of
                            similar computations, for payment of rent by civilian American agencies
                            in China and for procurement and construction purposes by the American
                            armed forces in China. Copies of the Department’s memorandum of July 8
                            and other relevant documents are being forwarded by air pouch.</item>

                            lend-lease aid would be in the form of Chinese currency and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) all or practically all Chinese currency which
                            might be received under reverse lend-lease would be expended only in

                            regarded as equivalent on the basis of reasonable exchange value to the
                            total amount of Chinese reverse lend-lease currency expended, the
                            Department does not consider that it is likely that under the proposed
                            agreement China would be asked to give to us under reverse lend-lease
                            more than China receives from us under lend-lease. In addition
                            Department concurs in the views expressed by you in the last sentence of

                    <p>1878. [Here follows report on sale by American civilian personnel of United
                        States currency and drafts in the Chinese black market.]</p>
                    <p>I am circulating all Foreign Service personnel in China directing attention
                        to provisions of notes IV and V section 1–19 Foreign Service Regulations and
                        am also cautioning all members of Embassy that facilities for issuance of
                        bank drafts for United States currency for any part of their salaries or
                        allowances will be available only for the purposes of direct transmission to
                        the United States and such drafts are not to be sold directly or indirectly
                        in the black market.</p>
                    <p>Situation reported by this telegram is result of three factors: fantastic and
                        continuously spiraling cost of living, open use of black market by American
                        Army personnel, apparently with tacit approval of American Government, thus
                        creating gross discrimination as between members of the military and
                        civilian services; and subjection of cost of living allowances to income and
                        victory tax which heavily reduces those allowances.</p>
                    <p>While the only immediate action which can be taken in the present problem of
                        living costs at Kunming, and at Chungking and elsewhere, is by increasing
                        without delay cost of living allowances for American <pb n="566" xml:id="pg_566" facs="0576"/>personnel and further temporary salary
                        increases for Chinese personnel, this is not a satisfactory solution, which
                        can probably be found only in provision of Chinese currency grants by
                        Chinese Government under reverse Lend-Lease and the fixing of allowances in
                        Chinese currency adequate to meet rapidly spiraling living costs. It was my
                        understanding that furtherance of reverse Lend-Lease proposals was awaiting
                        a report from General Stilwell who tells me it was sent in some three weeks
                        ago by telegraph. I trust that Department may be soon in a position to urge
                        the proposal on the attention of the Chinese Government. On cost of living
                        allowances let me emphasize that American personnel do not enjoy full
                        benefit of such allowances due to resulting increase in their income and
                        victory taxes since Treasury Department rules that such allowances represent
                        taxable income. I find that our income and victory taxes are increased by
                        amounts equalling 22 to 59% of the amount of our cost of living allowances.
                        First mentioned figure represents result to unmarried American clerk while
                        latter figure represents my own case. I urge that Treasury be asked to
                        reconsider ruling which includes cost of living allowances as taxable
                        income. Such allowances are in actual fact exchange adjustments. If Treasury
                        unwilling to reconsider matter I urgently recommend legislation by Congress.
                        I am informed that allowances to other services are made in a form which
                        does not bring them within taxable income but so far I have not been able to
                        obtain precise information concerning their allowances.</p>

                    <p>1990. Reference your 1449, October 8. Shortly after receipt your message and
                        return to Chungking of Foreign Minister Soong, General Somervell<note n="52" xml:id="d481fn52">Lt. Gen. Brehon Somervell, Commanding General, United
                            States Services of Supply.</note> of Army arrived here and, being
                        greatly concerned over fact that due to exchange rate, airfields, et cetera,
                        are costing American Government in China 4 to 5 times what they would cost
                        in the United States, he approached Foreign Minister Soong proposing an
                        arrangement under which China should provide Stilwell for War Department use
                        Chinese currency at a rate 5 times the official exchange rate or in effect
                        100 to 1. He stated requirements of Army would very soon reach CN dollars
                        500 million a month. He suggested that this arrangement be outside proposed
                        reverse Lend-Lease agreement which should be confined to services, supplies,
                        et cetera. After making that proposal orally to Soong, Somervell consulted
                        me and was told that if the arrangement could be made at all it likely could
                        only be made as reverse Lend-Lease. Foreign Minister later asked that Major
                        General Clay who has been here with Somervell should see Finance Minister
                        Kung. Atcheson accompanied Clay to see Kung this morning. Kung was opposed
                        to Army proposal but when Atcheson suggested its consideration under reverse
                        Lend-Lease be [<hi rend="italic">he</hi>] showed more favorable disposition

                    <p>2005. My 1990, October 20. I called on Soong by appointment this morning
                        accompanied by Atcheson, went over with him the general subject of reverse
                        Lend-Lease and also specifically Somervell’s proposals as explained to Kung
                        on October 20 by General Clay and Atcheson, and mentioned that the needs of
                        our civilian establishments would probably approximate CN dollars 5 million
                        a month.</p>
                    <p>Soong seemed favorably disposed in principle and said that Kung had mentioned
                        Somervell’s proposal to him casually but no definitive discussion had taken
                        place. He said that some time ago the Executive Yuan had given consideration
                        to the draft reverse Lend-Lease agreement and had telegraphed to him in
                        Washington some suggestions in regard to it which led him to believe that
                        the matter was not well understood in Chungking; he had accordingly not
                        discussed those suggestions with the State Department as he thought it would
                        be better for him first to go into the matter with concerned officials of
                        the Government upon his return to Chungking. He said he would discuss it
                        with Dr. Kung and other officials and that as soon as practicable we could
                        have a round table discussion.</p>

                    <p>Please approach the Minister of Finance informally and inform him that this
                        Government regards as imperative Chinese cooperation in establishing, as
                        soon as possible, an equitable and realistic basis for meeting the financial
                        needs of American civilian establishments in China, either by implementation
                        of the proposed reciprocal Lend-Lease agreement or by an adequate special
                        exchange adjustment. Please add that in the meantime the Department has no
                        alternative other than to authorize its diplomatic and consular officials in
                        China to make use of the facilities now utilized by the United States
                        Military Forces in obtaining required Chinese currency.</p>

                        and operating expenses of the embassy and consular offices to the Army Post
                        Office at Kunming for United States currency. This will permit payment of
                        salaries and allowances in United States currency and payees will be
                        permitted to acquire Chinese currency therewith by the most advantageous

                        the Foreign Service Regulations should invariably be submitted. Please
                        report immediately whether the Army Post Office at Kunming is agreeable to
                        and has sufficient United States currency on hand for encashment of
                        aggregate drafts to be presented monthly.</p>

                    <p>2085. Reference my 2005, October 22 and previous on reverse Lend-Lease. On
                        October 26 Foreign Minister informed me he had discussed matter with Finance
                        Minister and had no objection to my seeing latter personally. I was unable
                        obtain appointment till yesterday when Atcheson and I saw Kung and carefully
                        outlined situation, referring <pb n="570" xml:id="pg_570" facs="0580"/>to
                        basic Lend-Lease agreement, proposals for reverse Lend-Lease, needs for our
                        Army stated by Somervell now to be approaching 500,000,000 Chinese dollars
                        monthly, situation arising out of official exchange rate which finds cost of
                        airport and other facilities provided by our Army 8 to 10 times costs in
                        United States, reaction and criticism likely to result from this situation,
                        needs of American civilian agencies in China, and necessity of Chinese
                        cooperation in establishing equitable and realistic basis for meeting
                        financial needs of American military and civilian agencies in China either
                        by implementation of proposed reverse Lend-Lease or by adequate special
                        exchange adjustments (see your 1565, October 31, 3 [<hi rend="italic">1</hi>] p.m.).</p>
                    <p>Kung was affable and friendly but, while assuring me that he and Gissimo<note n="55" xml:id="d484fn55">Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</note> and
                        Chinese Government are disposed to do anything possible to help American
                        Government, he gave no indication that matter has in fact had serious study
                        or that any realistic and satisfactory solution will soon be forthcoming. He
                        made it plain, he has no intention of changing present artificial exchange
                        rate, and as to reverse Lend-Lease said he had been surprised that American
                        Army expenditures were of such magnitude as suggested by Somervell,
                        commented that while China would study whether it could give financial aid
                        to us in present situation China might have to turn again to United States
                        for further financial assistance (tending to confirm a suspicion I have had
                        for some time that before long China will be asking for another loan), and
                        as to my intimation (see your 1565) that authorization has been given for
                        our civil agencies temporarily to make use of same facilities as our Army in
                        obtaining Chinese currency, that is by use of U. S. currency in China, said
                        he had no objection but queried whether this might not lead to Congressional
                        criticism and also intimated that U. S. currency [from?] Army forces is
                        finding its way to Shanghai and to the Japs.</p>
                    <p>Kung talked away from every point made by us and while repeating assurances
                        of desire to be of assistance to American Government gave no indication that

                    <p>I intend to have a further conversation on subject with Foreign Minister but
                        we understand confidentially that latter has been having family trouble with
                        his brothers-in-law and sisters<note n="56" xml:id="d484fn56">Generalissimo

                    <p>2095. Continuing my 2085, November 5, 2 p.m., and with reference your 1565,
                        October 31, 1 p.m. Authorization to obtain United States currency for
                        Embassy, Consulates and other civilian agencies presents practical problems
                        which may be difficult to overcome.</p>
                    <p>APO Chungking does not have sufficient funds to encash our drafts or checks
                        and according best available information here APO Kunming does not have
                        funds to handle more than perhaps 1 to 5,000 United States dollars. Chief of
                        Staff Army forces says military agencies such as APO and Finance officers
                        have only sufficient funds for their own use and while United States
                        currency might be available at Karachi from United States Army there, the
                        problem would be to bring it into China and risk and responsibility
                        attaching, which Army would be disinclined to accept. Recent losses of
                        planes due to enemy action on Assam–China run increases risks involved.</p>
                    <p>Even if United States currency can be made available it is doubtful whether
                        it could be disposed of in any substantial amounts at Chungking. Principal
                        market is at Kunming and any heavy increase of United States currency there
                        might be difficult to exchange.</p>
                    <p>Embassy estimates that about 40,000 United States dollars monthly would be
                        required for Embassy and other civilian agencies based at Chungking, for
                        salaries and allowances alone. Total of Embassy and all such agencies for
                        salaries, allowances and operating expenses has recently run to as much as
                        140,000 United States currency a month.</p>
                    <p>While your 1565 refers to “operating expenses” as well as salaries and
                        allowances, I question whether, except in those few cases where contracts as
                        for rent have unauthorizedly been made in actual United States currency, it
                        would be possible to use such currency since that would necessitate an
                        officer going officially into black market to sell such currency and no
                        exchange vouchers would be obtainable to support accounts.</p>
                    <p>Embassy does not understand statement that certificates required by note 5
                        section 1–19 Foreign Service Regulations should invariably be submitted. No
                        such certificates are prescribed by regulations. I have endeavored to
                        ascertain whether there exists any Chinese law or man <pb n="572" xml:id="pg_572" facs="0582"/>date making illegal the sale of United
                        States currency in China but so far have been unable to do so. As reported
                        in my 2085, Kung raised no objection to our using United States currency.
                        There are regulations punishing by martial law those engaging in certain
                        black market activities in commodities. We know that Chinese Government has
                        sought to cease [<hi rend="italic">crack?</hi>] down black market exchange
                        shops at Kunming but do not know under what law, if any, this was done.</p>
                    <p>I will bring Department’s authorization to attention of consular officers and
                        representatives of other agencies, and am making inquiry through Consul at
                        Kunming as to possibility of implementing this authorization through
                        encashment of drafts and check for Chungking, sale of resulting United
                        States currency at Kunming and its remittance to Chungking.</p>
                    <p>Department may find it necessary to arrange with War Department for supply of
                        United States currency by United States Army to Kunming or Chungking.</p>
                    <p>I will report further upon receipt of information requested from Consul at
                        Kunming.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Reverse Lend-Lease Discussion With China</p>
                    <p>After discussing the matter with Mr. Stanton, I telephoned Colonel Foster in
                        order to call his attention to the latest communication we have had from
                        Chungking on the above subject, namely, Mr. Gauss’ telegram 2085 of November
                        5, 2 p.m. I told Colonel Foster that the Department had already sent a
                        paraphrase of this telegram to the War Department and suggested that if he
                        had not yet obtained a copy I thought he would wish to take steps with the
                        War Department’s liaison officers in order to get a copy. I then summarized
                        the substance of the telegram and stressed the fact that Mr. Gauss now
                        suggests that we consider making a formal approach in precise terms.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Foster asked me if I had heard any reports as to General Somervell’s
                        statements on this subject since he has returned to Washington. I said that
                        I had not. Colonel Foster said that he has not yet seen General Somervell,
                        but that he has been working on the matter continuously for the past few
                        days, and that he hoped—on the basis of General Somervell’s views—to have
                        something concrete within a short time. He went on to say that he was rather
                        surprised at the somewhat discouraging tone of Mr. Gauss’ telegram of
                        November 5 in view of <pb n="573" xml:id="pg_573" facs="0583"/>the fact that
                        he understood that General Somervell, according to those who have talked to
                        the General since he returned to Washington, feels rather encouraged that
                        something satisfactory can be worked out with the Chinese on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>I replied that in the absence of knowledge as to General Somervell’s exact
                        views and particularly in the absence of knowledge of what various Chinese
                        officials may have said to General Somervell who had, we understood,
                        conversations in Chungking at which Mr. Gauss was not present, we were in no
                        position to comment on General Somervell’s optimism. I said that on the
                        basis of our information we do not feel warranted in being over-optimistic
                        but that nonetheless we thought a further approach would be wise. I asked
                        Colonel Foster please to take steps to communicate the War Department’s
                        views on this matter in writing and in precise terms so that we could take
                        up with O.L.L.A. and Treasury the question of making a new concrete approach
                        to the Chinese. Colonel Foster said that he would be glad to take steps to
                        this end. I emphasized the fact that since Lend-Lease agreements are
                        primarily designed to facilitate military operations the views of the War
                        Department are of particular importance and that under the circumstances we
                        would take no action until we heard from the War Department. Colonel Foster
                        agreed that the initiative in this matter now lies with the War Department
                        who can be expected to communicate their views to us in the near future.</p>

                                are at present around United States $15 to 20 million per month. It
                                is to be expected that the equivalent amount of Chinese national
                                currency expenditures could be met at considerably less cost in

                    <p>1684. The Department has interposed no objection to the instructions recently
                        given Adler by the Treasury Department in regard to the possible acquisition
                        of Chinese currency. (Department’s 1672, November 20.) However, in view of
                        probability that negotiations may be protracted and that conversion rate to
                        be suggested by Kung may be unsatisfactory Department has informed Treasury
                        that pending wholly satisfactory completion of proposed arrangement
                        Department must maintain freedom of action in arranging for acquisition of
                        Chinese currency on a realistic basis. As an interim measure, therefore,
                        Department has requested War Department to arrange for shipment of $500,000
                        in United States currency, your estimated quarterly needs, to Army Finance
                        Officer at Kunming and to authorize him to cash drafts on the Secretary of

                        establishments in China. War Department is agreeable to shipment provided
                        prior approval of General Stilwell is obtained. Please impress on Stilwell
                        Department’s urgent need for his approval.</p>

                    <p>Colonel Foster came in to supply us with a copy of a draft of an agreement
                        which the War Department proposes be suggested to the Chinese Government
                        covering the furnishing of Chinese currency for the use of American military
                        forces in China.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Foster explained that the draft agreement, a copy of which is
                        attached hereto,<note n="58" xml:id="d489fn58">
                     <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> was designed to be a supplemental agreement to the
                        general reverse Lend-Lease agreement which has already been proposed to the
                        Chinese Government and that the two agreements would, if approved by the
                        Chinese, be signed simultaneously. The special agreement on currency would,
                        in effect, spell out in detail the means by which China would provide the
                        “financial services” provided for in the general agreement along lines which
                        have already been communicated informally to the Chinese first by Mr. Dean
                        Acheson last May and subsequently by our Embassy in Chungking and by
                        Generals Somervell and Clay (most recently during the visit of the two
                        Generals at Chungking in October). Colonel Foster explained that General
                        Somervell obtained the impression while in Chungking that the Chinese are
                        prepared to enter into an agreement along the lines of the draft special
                        agreement. Colonel Foster was aware of the fact that Mr. Gauss has received
                        a less optimistic impression.</p>
                    <p>The War Department is contemplating sending Mr. Edward C. Acheson to
                        Chungking to represent the War Department and the Lend-Lease Administration
                        for the negotiation, with the cooperation and advice of the Embassy, of the
                        special agreement. In pursuance of this intention the War Department has
                        sent a telegram to General Stilwell asking whether he approves of such a
                        procedure. Colonel Foster said that if the draft agreement is approved by
                        the interested government departments and if General Stilwell approves the
                        assignment of Mr. Edward C. Acheson to this work the War Department will
                        keep in close touch with us so that the Embassy can be notified in advance
                        of Mr. Acheson’s arrival.</p>
                    <p>There ensued some discussion of the terms of the draft agreement. Colonel
                        Foster was shown a copy of the Department’s telegram No. 1672 of November 20
                        to Chungking, being a message from the Secretary of the Treasury to Mr.
                        Adler in which Mr. Adler was instructed to ask Dr. Kung whether the Chinese
                        Government will sell to the United States Government for United States
                        currency or gold four <pb n="576" xml:id="pg_576" facs="0586"/>hundred
                        million dollars worth of Chinese currency per month. Colonel Foster said
                        that the War Department would await the Chinese reaction to the Treasury
                        proposal before going forward with its proposed special agreement and would
                        coordinate its actions with those of the Treasury. He said that he proposed
                        to take a copy of the draft special agreement to the Treasury and to
                        Lend-Lease in the very near future.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out to Colonel Foster that the draft agreement provides for
                        making Chinese currency available to the United States armed forces in
                        China. Colonel Foster in turn pointed out that Clause F would authorize the
                        utilization of the Chinese currency to be received under the agreement for
                        the operations of any U. S. agency in China connected with the war effort
                        and that the U. S. Government has a right to determine for what purposes
                        expenditures will be made. He said that in drafting this clause he had in
                        mind the supplying of currency to the Embassy including all the American
                        governmental civilian establishments in China. He went on to say that it
                        seemed to him this method had two special merits: (1) it was consistent with
                        the general military purpose of Lend-Lease activities and (2) it was not so
                        apt to put the Chinese in the position of automatically having to grant
                        similar facilities to the diplomatic and to the civilian establishments in
                        China maintained by other governments.</p>

                        <item>Saw Dr. Kung yesterday and asked him for quotation on price at which
                            Chinese Government would be willing to make CN dollars 400,000,000
                            monthly available to United States Government. We had long and amicable
                            conversations though Kung tended to be evasive except toward close. He
                            reviewed Chinese financial situation at some length, claiming that
                            change in official rate would undermine confidence in <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> and accelerate rise in prices, to which I replied
                            Treasury was not raising question of official rate and that it made no
                            difference to internal prices whether United States Government
                            expenditures were financed at price of 20 to 1 or of 100 to 1. Kung,
                            after commenting that experts could understand that but not laymen and
                            that it was impossible to keep secret price at which Chinese Government
                            sells <hi rend="italic">fapi</hi> to us, stated that China has advanced
                            CN dollars 3,000,000,000 since outbreak of Pacific war for constructing
                            airports and providing transportation facilities, et cetera, for USAAF,
                            that China was preparing to ask us for another loan, and that any
                            increase in the expenditures for USAAF would merely mean an increase in
                            amounts he would ask for.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>At this stage I mentioned the three alternative methods of payment
                            indicated in your point 3 (re your 1672 of November 20th). Kung first
                            rejected all three and offered as alternatives: <list>

                                <item>His going over USAAF expenditures with Generalissimo and
                                    General Stilwell—which he is to do in near future—finding out
                                    where it was possible to cut them: and agreeing to bear a
                                    proportion, which he did not specify, under reverse Lend-Lease.
                                    I pointed out that reverse Lend-Lease negotiations had been
                                    protracted and that it might take some time to conclude them, to
                                    which he claimed that his Government had already decided to
                                    agree in principle and that agreement might be consummated in
                                    near future.</item>

                                <item>His not objecting to Treasury shipping U.S. currency to China
                                    to be sold in black market, adding that sales in quantity would
                                    push down price. But he did not recur to this suggestion in his
                                    final offer.</item>
                            </list>
                  </item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>I then pointed out that USAAF expenditures were being financed at
                            official rate, that U.S. Government expenditures in China were out of
                            all proportion to return on them and that U.S. is now selling gold in
                            Middle East to finance its expenditures, emphasizing your point 2. Kung
                            said he had no objection in principle to gold being sold on our account
                            in China, but sales in any quantity would both push price down and
                            compete with China’s gold selling policy and in any case would not yield
                            enough to cover our needs. I made it clear that <pb n="579" xml:id="pg_579" facs="0589"/>sale of gold on our account need not
                            compete with theirs if sales conducted through one selling agency, to
                            which he agreed, indicating Central Bank was now selling gold for
                            Chinese Government. He added parenthetically that cost of shipping gold
                            was so high that he was considering keeping gold on earmark with Federal
                            Reserve Bank and selling certificates representing claims on gold rather
                            than selling gold itself.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Finally he said he was willing to offer Treasury choice of one of
                            following alternatives: A. 2(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) above. B.
                            Agreeing to your 3(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) subject to Generalissimo’s
                            consent and paying 40 to 1 in exchange for U.S. dollars for U.S.
                            Government needs over and above proceeds of sales of gold for our
                            account.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Comments on offer. For 4A see my comment on 2 (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) above; for this reason alone—not to mention fact that Kung
                            would not specify what proportion of our expenditures China would be
                            willing to finance under reverse Lend-Lease—it is not worth serious
                            consideration as an alternative, though it may be as a supplementary
                            measure. As for 4B: <list>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It is clear from above conversation and from other sources
                                    that China does not contemplate selling much gold and that Kung
                                    does not expect us to be able to raise anywhere near enough by
                                    this means to cover our expenditures. However, with the exertion
                                    of sufficient pressure it might be possible to push the sale of
                                    gold to the point where it would yield an appreciable part of
                                    our needs.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>)</label>
                                <item>As for price of 40 to 1, it is miserably low. I suggest that
                                    Treasury ask for at least 100 to 120 to 1 in which case it might
                                    be possible to settle finally at not less than 80.</item>

                        <item>Dr. Kung concluded with remark that above conversation was a
                            preliminary discussion. [Adler.]</item>

                            be negotiated with the Chinese. It is possible the Chinese Government
                            might agree to conclude simultaneously the War Department’s agreement
                            mentioned above and the comprehensive reciprocal aid agreement, the
                            former being regarded as a subsidiary agreement specifying the financial
                            procedure to be followed in supplying Chinese currency.</item>

                    <p>2365. Re matter of reverse Lend-Lease or some other arrangement re exchange
                        financing of United States Army and other expenditures in China (re your
                        1751, December 6), Kung’s reaction to Treasury proposals has certainly not
                        been encouraging (see our 2228, November 24, noon and 2235, November 25, 10
                        a.m.). Adler is awaiting comment from Treasury before pressing matter
                        further, but is far from sanguine that further informal approaches will be
                        productive.</p>
                    <p>Our proposals for reverse Lend-Lease equally received little satisfactory
                        reaction from Kung (see our 2085, November 5, 2 p.m.) and within production
                            [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of Treasury proposals I have not felt that
                        I should press the Lend-Lease suggestion.</p>
                    <p>War Department’s tentative proposal in event of failure Treasury negotiations
                        is merely a repetition of proposal put forward by General Somervell (see our
                        1990, October 20, 6 p.m.) except that it raises amount required monthly from
                        5 to 600 million Chinese dollars. Kung’s reaction to Somervell plan was
                        plainly adverse. New War Department proposal will certainly meet cold
                        reception.</p>
                    <p>Treasury may wish to push its negotiations further. If they do not succeed, I
                        recommend that State, Treasury, War, FEA and other interested war agencies
                        should consult and a strong formal approach should then be made to Chinese
                        Government for reasonable equitable financial exchange arrangements
                        preferable within the general framework of reverse Lend-Lease but assuring
                        China of some reasonable accumulations of United States dollars
                        resources.</p>
                    <pb n="582" xml:id="pg_582" facs="0592"/>
                    <p>I feel that, as China is highly sensitive to United States public opinion and
                        criticism, some carefully controlled publicity on existing arbitrary
                        exchange situation in China as affecting costs we must pay for financing war
                        effort here—costs 8 to 10 times those payable for comparable services and
                        facilities in United States—and possible suggestion of Congressional
                        interest in the matter would have beneficial effect here in lighting a fire
                        under those inclined to be non-cooperative and evasive and desirous of
                        continuing to exploit the situation to accumulate large United States
                        dollars reserves out of our war expenditures.</p>

                                feels that U. S. military and civilian governmental agencies should

                        agreement in the terms of the draft note enclosed with the Department’s mail

                        acknowledgement of such note should be along the lines of enclosure No. 2 to
                        the Department’s mail instruction under reference with following

                            advisable from point of view of Sino-American relations. Kung replied

                            Government sales had been quite small, its policy being to buy back a
                            substantial part of what it had sold to keep up price which is now
                            around CN 13,000 per Chinese oz. selling in Chungking.</item>

                            100 percent in near future, was a subsidy from the Chinese

                    <p>2428. Upon examination of the files we find that we have two drafts of
                        proposed reverse Lend-Lease agreement which vary considerably in language
                        although not in general purport: (1) draft enclosed with Department’s mail
                        instruction No. 250, March 17, and referred to in Department’s 313, March 9
                        and 637, May 19;<note n="65" xml:id="d499fn65">No. 637 not printed, but see
                            footnote 25, <ref target="#pg_537">p. 537</ref>.</note> and (2) draft
                        received March 30 from Stilwell’s headquarters (it was stated in
                        Department’s 313, March 9, that was being communicated to Stilwell with
                        request that he furnish Embassy a copy and therefore the copy received by us
                        from him should assumably be identical with that enclosed with Department’s
                        mail instruction reference).</p>
                    <p>We have not yet been able to learn whether (2) is in fact the draft as
                        communicated to Stilwell via War Department or whether its variations from
                        (1) represent suggestions for changes. In any case, as Foreign Office
                        desires a copy of appropriate draft to compare with that in its possession
                        preparatory to signature, we suggest that the difficulty can most easily and
                        quickly be resolved by telegraphing us the final approved text in full as
                        soon as possible—unless that text definitely is the same as the one enclosed
                        with Department’s mail instruction No. 250, March 17.</p>

                    <p>2429. With reference to proposal that China should now after such a long
                        delay sign reverse Lend-Lease agreement, we suggest that this sudden Chinese
                        decision likely has as principal motive the making of a gesture which would
                        gain China face and praise in the United States and at same time avoid
                        possibility of congressional and other criticism if the circumstances of
                        exploitation of our Army in China [by?] Minister <pb n="586" xml:id="pg_586" facs="0596"/>of Finance’s services and facilities should become publicly
                        known. Unless steps are taken to implement proposed arrangement, the gesture
                        would cost China nothing. Reports by Embassy to Department and by Adler to
                        Treasury on attitude of Minister [of] Finance do not encourage us to believe
                        that agreement if signed will be implemented satisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>On other hand it might be serious tactical error to decline to enter into
                        agreement we ourselves proposed and give Chinese opportunity to say they
                        offered to share heavy burden of our military operations in China and had
                        been turned down.</p>
                    <p>We therefore propose that we inform Chinese orally that we shall be very glad
                        to enter into the agreement but that we suggest that actual signing be timed
                        to coincide with conclusion of appropriate detailed arrangements to
                        implement it. This oral statement might be supplemented by formal approach
                        already recommended setting forth in precise terms the nature and extent of
                        financial services we desire from China.</p>
                    <p>If notwithstanding foregoing Department considers it preferable to sign the
                        agreement forthwith as accomplishing at least a step forward, we suggest
                        that means be taken to offset possible Chinese effort to outmanoeuvre us by
                        making clear in an official American announcement that the agreement is
                        confined to broad aspects of principles and intentions which merely lay the
                        ground work for implementation which we expect Chinese Government will
                        undertake without delay, especially in provision of arrangements and
                        facilities and services for our Armed Forces which are within capacity of
                        China to supply.</p>

                    <p>1820. Department does not regard as valid the objections raised in the fifth
                        paragraph of Embassy’s 2095, November 5 to the utilization of open market
                        funds for operating expenses. (Your 2377, December 11) Under the
                        authorization granted for the sale of official drafts for United States
                        currency, it is contemplated that the Embassy and consular offices will
                        exchange this currency by the most advantageous means available to provide
                        funds to cover their operating expenses payable in Chinese currency. As to
                        the Embassy’s statement that exchange vouchers covering such transactions
                        would be unobtainable to support the accounts, a certificate by the officer
                        rendering the accounts describing the exchange facilities utilized to
                        convert the currency, stating the rates obtained, and certifying that it was
                        impracticable <pb n="587" xml:id="pg_587" facs="0597"/>to obtain exchange
                        vouchers, will be acceptable in lieu thereof. In this connection see Section
                        V–45, Note 3 of the Foreign Service Regulations.</p>
                    <p>With respect to the question raised in the 6th paragraph of Embassy’s 2095
                        regarding the submission of certificates under Note 5, Section I–19, as
                        requested in the 4th paragraph of the Department’s 1565, October 31,
                        reference is made to the revision of this Note dated June, 1943, which
                        contains provision for such certificates. The substance of this revised note
                        is that certificates should be executed by persons receiving salaries and
                        allowances in dollars to the effect that such dollars have not been
                        converted into foreign currency at a rate more favorable than the prevailing
                        official or current bank rate, except as fully explained in a separate
                        report to the Department. If a joint certificate is utilized it should not
                        be submitted with the accounts but should be prepared on a separate sheet
                        and forwarded directly to the Department under cover of a despatch.</p>

                    <p>1. Pursuant to Chiang’s request, and by appointment I saw Kung
                                December 29 accompanied by Atcheson. I mentioned to Kung that we had
                                discussed with Generalissimo question reverse Lend-Lease and he had
                                requested I see Kung again on the matter. I said I would be glad to
                                communicate to Department any comment or proposal Kung might wish to
                                make.</p>
                            <pb n="588" xml:id="pg_588" facs="0598"/>
                            <p>Kung indicated that Chinese Government was surprised American
                                Government had not shown immediate favorable reaction to suggestion
                                by Foreign Office that May 15 draft reverse Lend-Lease agreement now
                                be signed at Chungking (our 2404, December 14) as draft had been
                                proposed by the American Government, had been studied by Chinese
                                Government which had dropped its suggested changes, and had been
                                agreed to by Chinese Government. I said that we had not yet received
                                instructions and place of signing was, of course, immaterial.
                                Atcheson suggested that the draft had been proposed many months ago
                                and since that time General Somervell had come here with his
                                proposal in regard to U. S. Army expenditures and various related
                                questions had come up for discussion. I inquired whether Chinese
                                Government had any plans to implement reverse Lend-Lease
                                agreement.</p>
                            <p>Kung replied in vague terms that China’s vital economic problem was
                                maintenance of the currency, mentioning that Japan was waging
                                economic as well as military warfare on China, and said that if
                                currency did not stand up everything would collapse. He said he had
                                proposed to Chinese Government that American Army expenditures here
                                be matched dollar by dollar, with some of such expenditures matched
                                by two dollars, and indicated that Chinese Government approved. (He
                                referred to Chinese dollars, of course.) In response to inquiry he
                                confirmed that such proposal involves provision of Chinese currency
                                in ration equivalent to exchange rate of 40 to 60 to 1. He said that
                                Chinese currency so provided would of course be credited to China’s
                                reverse Lend-Lease account (assumably at 20 to 1 for currency
                                provided over and above the official rate of 20 to 1). He showed us
                                a letter to him from the President dated November 26,<note n="67" xml:id="d503fn67">
                     <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_455">p. 455</ref>.</note> which he thought had
                                been written in Cairo and mailed in Washington, mentioning that
                                Generalissimo and Mme. Chiang had approached the President in regard
                                to question of inflation in China and that the President had made
                                some suggestion to them which he contemplated discussing with
                                Treasury. Kung said that the President well understood China’s
                                difficulties and I replied that we endeavored to keep him and our
                                Government in general fully informed developments as they
                                occurred.</p>
                            <p>In light of Department’s 1841, December 22, we were in no position to
                                make comment other than that outlined above and I said merely that I
                                would let Kung know as soon as instructions were received. Kung was
                                most cordial and affable throughout.</p>
                        <p>2. We are informed by General Hearn<note n="68" xml:id="d503fn68">Brig.
                                Gen. Thomas G. Hearn, Chief of Staff to General Stilwell.</note>
                            that an Army “financial adviser named Acheson” is shortly coming here in
                            connection with <pb n="589" xml:id="pg_589" facs="0599"/>this matter and
                            that accordingly “things will soon begin to happen”. Local
                            representative of Chase National Bank states he has been instructed to
                            remain Chungking until arrival of Professor Edward Acheson and has asked
                            for information as to prospective date thereof—information which we
                            could not, of course, furnish as we have not been advised. We hope that
                            if Professor Acheson is being sent here by the [War Department?] for
                            purpose indicated by Hearn he will have full authority to speak for all
                            concerned agencies and thus tend to resolve the deplorable confusion
                            which has resulted from the uncoordinated approaches made by
                            representatives of the different departments interested in the
                            matter.</p>

                    <p>Mr. E. C. Acheson, who has been lent by the Lend-Lease Administration to the
                        War Department for service in China as General Stilwell’s financial adviser,
                        came to see me yesterday. He plans to leave for China today. He said that he
                        was going without instructions in so far as the main purpose of his
                        assignment was concerned, i. e. to facilitate the working out of appropriate
                        financial arrangements whereby U.S. Army forces in China will obtain Chinese
                        currency at rates better than the arbitrary official rate of exchange. He
                        said that the reason for his lack of instructions on this point was that
                        Secretary Morgenthau in some agitation had called Generals Somervell and
                        Clay to see him as soon as he learned that Mr. Acheson was going out to
                        China on financial matters. Secretary Morgenthau had insisted that the Army
                        should not go forward with financial discussions with the Chinese because of
                        “negotiations” which he (Mr. Morgenthau) is at the moment conducting with
                        the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Acheson indicated that Generals Somervell and Clay are still of the
                        opinion that the most advantageous course of action for the Army to follow
                        is to try to obtain a separate financial agreement having no relation to
                        Lend-Lease or Reverse Lend-Lease. Mr. Acheson indicated that he thought that
                        shortly after he arrived in Chungking it would prove possible for the War
                        Department to instruct him to present the Somervell–Clay proposal to the
                        Chinese. Mr. Acheson is aware of the fact that our own estimate of the
                        situation and that of the Embassy does not agree with the optimism which
                        Generals Somervell and Clay apparently feel on this matter. I urged Mr.
                        Acheson to be sure to call upon Ambassador Gauss promptly and to coordinate
                        his duties as closely as possible with the Ambassador.</p>

               </p>
                    <p>Chinese and Soviet Governments have reached agreement with regard to
                        transport of Lend-Lease materials across Sinkiang but agreement has not yet
                        been signed. Russians will transport 2,000 tons monthly to Hami or Hsing
                        Hsing Hsia and in addition will supply 300 tons monthly of gasoline (not 600
                        tons as reported to Currie). Although in principle Chinese undertake to
                        supply 2,000 tons of strategic material for return trip of trucks to Russia,
                        they will be unable to do so and discussions are now taking place with
                        regard to basis on which China will pay for unused capacity of trucks.
                        Chinese admit that they will not be able to deliver more than 1,000 tons
                        monthly to Sinkiang for Russians. Chinese expect that agreement will be
                        signed with Russians in near future.</p>
                    <p>Chinese are informed of discussions between British and Soviet Governments
                        regarding transport problem but apparently do not have exact information.
                        They view as unrealistic for the present at least any discussions for
                        transportation of more than 2,000 tons of Lend-Lease materials a month
                        across Iran and Turkestan to Alma Ata for trucking across Sinkiang and the
                        Embassy concurs in this view. They realize, however, that British
                        discussions with Russians involve also delivery of materials to Russia. They
                        state that whereas Russians are not requesting advance notice as to
                        character of Lend-Lease materials for China, British are requesting such
                        notification.</p>
                    <p>The apparent fact that it is the British that are undertaking to obtain for
                            [<hi rend="italic">from</hi>] us not only the trucks for transport
                        across Iran but also the trucks for Sinkiang transportation (although the
                        Russians will actually manage the transportation) is somewhat confusing. <pb n="591" xml:id="pg_591" facs="0601"/>The Embassy understands that the
                        trucks desired by China are for transportation from Sinkiang to interior
                        China.</p>

                                    officials in Iran some time ago informed British that they would
                                    prefer that the British take supplies consigned to Russia (these
                                    supplies are not connected with China) through Iranian ports all
                                    the way to Ashkhabad in order to avoid transfer at Meshed. The
                                    British agreed and requested visas for a party to survey the
                                    road between the Soviet frontier and Ashkhabad. No reply has as
                                    yet been received to this request. Embarrassed comments made by
                                    Soviet supply officials make it appear that the Commissariat for
                                    Internal Affairs has thus far not given consent to the British
                                    servicing the stretch within the Soviet Union.</item>

                                    indicates that there would be little difficulty in making
                                    available sufficient trucks and equipment to carry up to 4,000
                                    tons monthly from Zahidan to Ashkhabad. The Karachi–Zahidan
                                    railroad is again working. The main problem therefore is that of
                                    trucks for the Russians to service the stretch through Sinkiang
                                    and for the Chinese to service the Chinese interior.</item>

                                    understands that the Chinese Government is requesting 4,000
                                    trucks from the American Government to service points between
                                    eastern Sinkiang and the Chinese interior. The telegram points
                                    out that the British cannot promise at present to receive trucks
                                    in addition to those already planned for at Karachi since the
                                    Commander-in-Chief of India must have prior operational claims
                                    upon assembly facilities there and also upon ports and transport
                                    facilities. It adds that although the Chinese seem to have
                                    available no other port than Karachi for bringing in trucks for
                                    China the Russians have other routes open for supplying their
                                    needs (obviously a reference to Vladivostok).</item>

                                <item>The difficulty with regard to trucks appears to be four-fold:
                                    (1) the inability of the Chinese to obtain an allotment from the
                                    United States authorities until definite Soviet-Chinese transit
                                    agreement has been concluded; (2) the shortage of vessels to
                                    transport them if allotted; (3) the lack of port facilities for
                                    unloading and assembling them; and (4) the lack of facilities

                        <item>We feel strongly that if the United Nations are to send any
                            appreciable amount of supplies to China along the route contemplated in
                            the near future it will be necessary for them to display an amount of
                            determination, resourcefulness and energy at least equal to that being
                            shown at present in sending supplies to the Soviet Union. The necessary
                            trucks should be allotted at once both to the Russians and Chinese
                            without waiting the conclusion of formal agreements; the shipping space
                            should be allocated; and steps should be taken immediately to begin
                            sending them through the Near East. Although we are not acquainted with
                            the condition of the various Iranian ports east of those now used for
                            Russian transit traffic or with the condition of land communication
                            between such ports and Zahidan we are wondering if United Nations
                            ingenuity if backed by determination would not be able to land the 5,200
                            trucks, spare parts, assembling equipment, gasoline and so forth at one
                            or several of these ports, to assemble these trucks at point of landing
                            and to send them under their own power overland to Zahidan where they
                            can be loaded with goods for China. From Zahidan they could proceed with
                            their loads to Ashkhabad whence the Russians could transport them and
                            their contents as fast as their railway facilities would permit to the
                            railhead near Alma Ata. From Alma Ata they could go to China under their
                            own power and thereafter be used either by the Russians in Sinkiang or
                            by the Chinese in the interior of China. In referring to Iranian ports
                            we have in mind such points as Chahbar, Jask, or Bandar Abbas.</item>

                                <item>It will be observed that the British are proceeding shortly to
                                    transport to Meshed by rail and road from Karachi goods for
                                    China on the assumption that such goods will be sent forward by
                                    the Russians in China. Until and unless the necessary conditions
                                    for maintaining the route to China can be fulfilled these goods
                                    will accumulate at Meshed thus providing the Russians with
                                    ground for urging the cessation at least temporarily of the
                                    transport of supplies for China <pb n="593" xml:id="pg_593" facs="0603"/>and an increase of supplies to Russia. If this
                                    proposal were perforce accepted the capacity of the road between
                                    Zahidan and Meshed to carry goods for China might well be
                                    compromised. This consideration especially calls for early
                                    action on our part toward making available the necessary trucks
                                    to both the Soviet and Chinese Governments.</item>

                        Mr. Finletter informed me that the meeting had been arranged by General
                        Burns who had requested that Mr. Finletter be present. Due to an engagement

                    <p>The meeting was informal and exploratory. General Burns said that the War
                        Department has now received a requisition from the Chinese for trucks for
                        the proposed route. In the course of the conversation General Burns stated
                        that he had been informed by representatives of China Defense Supplies that
                        the whole idea of the new route had originated with President Roosevelt.
                        General Burns also said that Mr. Hopkins<note n="9" xml:id="d507fn9">Harry

                        believing that it would be better for China’s full efforts to be directed
                        toward regaining the Burma Road. He said that he had <pb n="594" xml:id="pg_594" facs="0604"/>first heard of the proposed route from Dr.

                        representatives. He indicated that he did not think it was desirable for us
                        to assume any responsibility for actual operation of the route but said that
                        he would make available an officer for “reconnaissance” purposes [General
                        Spalding agreed to supply the Department with a paraphrase of this

                        important that General Stilwell’s negative attitude toward the road not be
                        allowed to reach the Chinese, as he feared that it might prejudice General

                    <p>General Burns asked Mr. Ray for the views and recommendations of the
                        Lend-Lease Administration. Mr. Ray said that he felt justified in stating
                        confidently that the Lend-Lease Administration regarded it as of importance
                        that the United States should give all possible assistance to making the
                        route effective. General Burns referred to the difficulty of ensuring
                        regular and efficient transportation over a long route through several
                        different countries. He kept asking the question: How would you organize the
                        route? Mr. Ray suggested that it might be wise to authorize an initial trial
                        shipment of about 800 trucks. These together with Lend-Lease trucks
                        allocated to China which are already in Karachi (now numbering about 350 but
                        subject to diminution if needed by General Stilwell) could be supplied with
                        necessary spare parts and other equipment for prolonged operation and loaded
                        in addition with Chinese Lend-Lease supplies now at Karachi. In view of the
                        fact that the British have indicated that they can supply from Iran and
                        India such trucks as are needed for the Iranian route, Mr. Ray suggested
                        that the additional 800 trucks might be divided on a fifty-fifty basis
                        between the Russians and the Chinese for use on the respective stretches of
                        the road to be operated by them.</p>
                    <p>General Burns then asked me what the attitude of the Department of State was
                        on the whole matter. I explained that thus far the Department had functioned
                        in connection with the proposed route largely from the point of view of
                        collecting information of assistance to the directly interested agencies in
                        ascertaining the status of the matter. General Burns said that in view of
                        General Stilwell’s attitude he thought that the primary question should be
                        one of the political desirability of complying with the Chinese request for
                        trucks. He and General Spalding said that there should be no difficulty at
                        all about obtaining the necessary quantities of trucks and that, although
                        there would be more difficulty with regard to shipping, they did not
                        anticipate very much difficulty on this score either. I referred to the
                        views expressed by our Embassy at Kuibyshev and both General Burns and <pb n="595" xml:id="pg_595" facs="0605"/>General Spalding said that they had
                        already received paraphrases of these telegrams. I said that I was in no
                        position to speak authoritatively for the Department but that a number of us
                        who had considered the matter had felt there was merit in the views
                        expressed in these two telegrams. I said that particularly it seemed to me
                        that if we could it would be desirable that no impression be given that
                        refusal of the United States to make trucks available had killed a promising
                        new route into China. General Burns, General Spalding and Mr. Ray expressed
                        themselves as fully in agreement with this point of view. As a result of
                        further discussion it seemed to be generally agreed by those present that it
                        might be wise to recommend that the Chinese be informed that this Government
                        is desirous of being as helpful as possible in making the new route
                        effective and that to that end we would be pleased to make available an
                        initial shipment of 800 trucks and that from the operation of these trucks
                        it would be possible to determine whether additional quantities could be
                        effectively utilized over the new route.</p>
                    <p>At this point General Burns again reverted to the question of adequate
                        cooperative organization throughout the extent of the route. He pointed out
                        that the Army and Lend-Lease Administration are accountable for dispositions
                        made of Government property and that therefore they must be reasonably
                        assured that any trucks allocated to the new route can accomplish the
                        purpose for which they are allocated. I remarked that since the proposal is
                        basically a Chinese proposal it would seem appropriate for the War
                        Department officials to discuss this matter directly with the Chinese and to
                        point out to the Chinese that our officials in charge of Lend-Lease
                        allocation would have to be supplied with an appropriate program of
                        operations which would include adequate reporting and other control
                        measures. General Burns said that he would prefer some such approach rather
                        than any attempt of the United States actually to take over operation and
                        supervision of a route which would in fact have to be operated in part by
                        the British, in part by the Russians and in part by the Chinese. It was
                        suggested that a member of General Wheeler’s<note n="13" xml:id="d507fn13">Maj. Gen. Raymond A. Wheeler, Commanding General, Services of Supply in
                            China, Burma, and India.</note> staff at Karachi might well turn over
                        the material initially to the British at Karachi and that the Chinese could
                        make arrangements for reports of operations from there through to Sinkiang.
                        It was also pointed out that when our Consulate at Tihwa is opened it might
                        be possible to receive direct reports from that point of materials passing
                        through Tihwa. These combined reports might perhaps supply an adequate
                        accounting system.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion General Burns said that he was prepared to support the
                        recommendation of the Lend-Lease Administration for an initial <pb n="596" xml:id="pg_596" facs="0606"/>allotment of 800 trucks along the lines
                        indicated if the Chinese could supply an adequate accounting procedure. He
                        asked that the views of the Department of State be communicated in a letter
                        to Secretary Stimson<note n="14" xml:id="d507fn14">Henry L. Stimson,

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: The Department is informed
                        that the Chinese Government has requested the allocation of a number of
                        trucks, under Lend-Lease arrangements to be utilized on the proposed new
                        route for Lend-Lease supplies to China via Karachi, Iran, the Soviet Union,
                        and the Province of Sinkiang. As you may be aware from copies of cables
                        which have been supplied to your Department, our Embassy at Kuibyshev has
                        recommended that if practicable this Government, by making trucks available,
                        should lend its support to the attempts being currently made to open this
                        new route.</p>
                    <p>The Department understands that consideration is being given to a proposal
                        that, subject of course to appropriate safeguards relating to supplying of
                        Lend-Lease equipment, a substantial initial allocation of trucks be made in
                        the near future. Although I am not conversant with all the details of the
                        matter I may say that it is the view of this Department that it would be
                        helpful in our relations with China if this Government could assist the
                        Chinese Government in this matter. <pb n="597" xml:id="pg_597" facs="0607"/>Accordingly, I venture to recommend the proposal under reference to your

                            presented to the Soviet Government the following counter-proposal of the

                                    the cost of operating trucks returning empty from Hami to Alma

                                    the latter accepted such offer, provided, however, that the
                                    gasoline is not to be computed within the 2,000 tons of goods to
                                    be supplied each month to China by the Soviet Government.</item>

                  </p>
                        <p>2. The Chargé d’Affaires said that whenever he presses the Soviet
                            authorities for an early reply the latter refer to the absence of any
                            arrangement for the supply by the United States of the trucks necessary
                            for the operation of the route. He believed that if the American
                            Government could in some way assure the Soviet and Chinese Governments
                            that the trucks would be made available he would expect to receive an
                            early and favorable reply to his Government’s last proposal.[”]</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Secretary</hi>: With regard to the matter of the 800
                        trucks:</p>
                    <p>It is our understanding that this Government’s interest in the matter began
                        with an expression of interest on the part of the President in the <pb n="598" xml:id="pg_598" facs="0608"/>Possibility of establishing a new
                        route to China through Iran and the Soviet Union; that Dr. Alfred Sze<note n="15" xml:id="d511fn15">Former Chinese Ambassador in the United
                            States.</note> on instructions from Dr. Soong made several calls upon
                        Mr. Hopkins in support of the Chinese request that trucks be allocated to
                        the proposed new route; that next there came approaches to this Government
                        from a British official source, with a representation that the British
                        Government was interested because of an expressed Russian and Chinese
                        interest, that the British Government had successfully concluded
                        negotiations with the Soviet Government for the latter’s participation in
                        the operation of the route, and that in British official circles it was felt
                        desirable that the trucks be supplied both for material reasons and for
                        political reasons; that in Lend-Lease circles supplying of the trucks has
                        been favored by Mr. Hopkins, by General Burns and by the Lend-Lease
                        Administration; and that in the course of recent conferences General Burns
                        and representatives of the War Department had indicated that 800 trucks
                        could be spared for the route without adverse effect upon the military
                        efforts of the United Nations.</p>
                    <p>Officers of this Department most concerned with the matter have taken the
                        view that the value of the highway over which these trucks would be intended
                        to operate into China is doubtful, but that allocation and expedition of
                        these trucks for this purpose, and delivery of them at the western terminus
                        of this highway would serve some material purposes useful to the United
                        Nations war effort in some connection; that this investment of
                        transportation would be experimental and, the number of trucks involved
                        being relatively small, would not be expensive; that if we supply these
                        trucks neither the British nor the Russians nor the Chinese would be able to
                        contend that a potentially useful project had been wrecked because of U.S.
                        failure to cooperate; whereas if we refuse to supply the trucks, some one or
                        more of those Governments is almost sure to make that charge; and that,
                        therefore, allocation of these trucks to this project would be politically
                        advantageous and would stand a fair chance of serving a material purpose as
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The latest word that we have on the subject, which has come in this morning,
                        gives support to this view. A telegram from Moscow dated January 26 repeats
                        a telegram from Kuibyshev dated January 22 reporting on information given by
                        the Chinese Chargé d’Affaire[s]. This telegram ends with a statement that
                        the Chargé said that, in the negotiations between the Soviet Government and
                        the Chinese Government for exchange of goods, discussion of details being in
                        process, whenever he urges the Soviet authorities to hasten their replies
                        those authorities cite the absence of any arrangement whereby the United
                        States would supply the trucks necessary to carry out the operations; <pb n="599" xml:id="pg_599" facs="0609"/>and the Chargé said that he
                        believes that if by some process the American Government could assure the
                        Soviet Government and his Government that the trucks would be supplied he
                        could expect to receive from the Soviet Government an early and favorable
                        reply to the latest proposal which his Government had made.</p>
                    <p>Such appear to be the simple facts and the essentially important
                        considerations.</p>
                    <p>We are not contending strongly either for or against this proposed
                        allocation. We feel it politically desirable. We feel that it might have
                        material advantages as well. We feel, however, that this Department should
                        not take or be represented as taking a substantial responsibility for
                        whatever decision is arrived at. This Department’s opinion has been sought
                        and it has been given. As given, it brings out and stresses the political
                        angles of the question.</p>
                    <p>All that we urge is that the War Department take into consideration <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the points, factors, possibilities, etc. that,
                        bearing upon this problem, have been brought to its attention.<note n="16" xml:id="d511fn16">This memorandum was sent on January 29 to the

                        Mr. Stimson emphasized especially the view which he had gained as a result
                        of making inquiries that the transportation route in question would be so
                        hard on rubber tires that the tires would be damaged and the Chinese would
                        get little, if any, use from the trucks. You mentioned that Mr. Stimson
                        expressed the view that we might tell the Chinese that the rubber aspect of
                        the situation, including the rubber shortage in this country, made it not
                        feasible for this Government to furnish trucks at this time. Mr. Stimson
                        said further that if of course you insisted they would carry out your
                        recommendation.</p>

                        material aspects of the proposed allocation of trucks; it was pointed out
                        that the allocation suggested, if made, might or might not result in
                        material advantages; and attention was called to <pb n="600" xml:id="pg_600" facs="0610"/>political ends which might be served by such an allocation
                        and which therefore should be given consideration.</p>

                        d’Affaires has informed me that as a result of recent negotiations with the
                        Russians in regard to Chinese questions there were indications that an
                        agreement on all points would soon be reached and that the Russians had
                        requested that the final adjustments be left until the new Chinese
                            Ambassador<note n="18" xml:id="d513fn18">Foo Ping-sheung.</note> arrives
                        in about 10 days. He stated that supplies for China were already arriving at
                        Zahidan and were being moved by trucks to Ashkhabad; however, there were not
                        sufficient trucks to handle all the supplies which were being accumulated in
                        Zahidan.</p>

                        conversations Molotov<note n="20" xml:id="d514fn20">V. M. Molotov, Soviet
                            Commissar for Foreign Affairs.</note> and Kalinin<note n="21" xml:id="d514fn21">Mikhail Ivanovich Kalinin, President of the Presidium
                            of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union.</note> had emphasized the
                        great strength and endurance of Japan and had given the Ambassador <pb n="601" xml:id="pg_601" facs="0611"/>the impression that the Soviet
                        Union was determined to be most circumspect in its relations with Japan in
                        order not to permit development of any untoward incident.</p>
                    <p>He stated that in his conversations with Molotov and Mikoyan<note n="22" xml:id="d514fn22">Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan, Soviet Commissar for
                            Foreign Trade.</note> on the question of transit shipments through the
                        Soviet Union a figure of 2,000 tons a month had finally been agreed upon;
                        that although the Russians at first had insisted upon return freight of a
                        like tonnage consisting of minerals and agricultural products they finally
                        had accepted a figure of 1,000 tons and payment in cash of 75% of the
                        freight costs involved in sending the trucks back empty; that 500 tons of
                        oil would be included in the outbound tonnage and that as transport
                        facilities improved the oil tonnage would be in addition to the original
                        tonnage. The Ambassador stated that 1,056 trucks would be needed on the Alma
                        Ata–Hami run and 2,000 additional trucks on the Hami–Chungking run to move
                        this tonnage and that he had requested T. V. Soong to urge through Harry
                        Hopkins that every effort be made to supply the trucks necessary to put this
                        line in operation and I informed him that I would also emphasize to the
                        Department the importance of expediting action in this respect.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador stated that he felt that the agreement with the Russians was a
                        real accomplishment in view of present Soviet caution vis-à-vis Japan and
                        that it was vital that the route be put into operation as soon as possible
                        not only because of its political significance but also in order to develop
                        the transport facilities so that freight tonnages could only be
                        increased.</p>

                            as a delicate matter, he did not insist that the arrangement be reduced
                            to writing. He said that he remarked to Mr. Mikoyan at the conclusion of

                            Governments could now proceed to the operation of the supply route and
                            that Mr. Mikoyan, who had been most accommodating and helpful throughout

                        last night Soviet trade representative informed me that 7 to 800 tons of
                        cargo per month is now moving from both directions across Sinkiang in Soviet
                        trucks. Cargo for China consisting gasoline, spare parts for Russian trucks
                        in Lanchow and miscellaneous articles of non-military nature. Outgoing cargo
                        consists of metals and minerals, hides and skins, wool, bristles, tea and
                        other miscellaneous items in small lots. This cargo movement is not related
                        to the “2000 tons agreement” but trade representative does not believe that
                        Chinese will be able to produce much more cargo after agreement comes into
                        effect. Reiterated request that American trucks be supplied for the
                        traffic.</p>

                            a.m., not printed.</note> which is sent for your information: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>A report which confirms substantially information received by the
                                Department concerning economic deterioration in Free China has been
                                received by the British Foreign Office from the British Embassy in
                                Chungking. Considerable emphasis is placed in the British report on
                                the critical food situation, especially as a result of the capture
                                by the Japanese of rice districts in the Lake Tungting area.
                                Although the information received by the British Foreign Office
                                confirms the belief that the Chinese Government and intellectual
                                leaders have no intention of seeking a settlement with Japan and
                                feel certain that the United Nations will eventually be victorious,
                                a high ranking British official has expressed himself as being
                                fearful that conditions amounting to an undeclared truce, at least
                                in the border districts, might result from a continuation of this
                                economic distress with its consequent increase in smuggling between
                                the occupied and free areas. The possible effect of the present
                                “soft” policy followed by the Japanese toward the Nanking regime on
                                Chinese claims that economic conditions in regions under puppet
                                control are superior to conditions in territory under the control of
                                Chungking is being given serious consideration by the British
                                Foreign Office.</p>
                            <p>All aspects of the problem of opening a supply route through Sinkiang
                                Province are being studied by the British who are still actively
                                interested in the subject. The transportation monthly of 1,700 tons
                                net of cargo over this route is the present goal. Although this is
                                admitted to be a small amount of cargo the Foreign Office is of the
                                opinion that the moral effect of the transportation of this cargo
                                will be out of all proportion to its size. The plan is to use this
                                route in the first place for industrial and civil supplies which are
                                waiting shipment now in India and which will not be included in the
                                additional supplies which it is planned to transport by air, those
                                being confined to military supplies only. It is the opinion of the
                                Foreign Office that the situation is so grave that no possibility of
                                getting aid to China, regardless of how small such aid might be,
                                should be overlooked.</p>

                        China and is continuing, as are other interested agencies of this

                        here aware: that interest in and support of this project by this Government
                        rest on our estimate of the political and moral aspects rather than on any
                        belief that the road has substantial economic or military potentialities. We
                        are supplying trucks in response to Chinese, Russian and British
                        solicitation, and for political effect. We do not oppose, but we also do not
                        advocate, intensive devotion of effort and materials to this project.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Stanton inquired whether there had been any new developments in regard to
                        trucks and drivers for this route. Mr. Ray stated that as we already knew
                        the British had supplied 520 trucks from stocks in <pb n="606" xml:id="pg_606" facs="0616"/>India; that 200 additional trucks had
                        arrived and were being assembled at Karachi; and that 400 additional trucks
                        shipped from the United States were now on the high seas and should reach
                        India in the near future. He said therefore that there were good prospects
                        that a fleet of a thousand trucks requested by the Russians for operation of
                        the Alma Ata–Hami section of the route would be ready for operation by the
                        end of August. As regards drivers, Mr. Ray stated that the British had
                        furnished a few but that efforts were now being made to obtain Chinese
                        drivers from the Chinese forces in training at Rangarh. Mr. Stanton inquired
                        what supplies and equipment would be shipped in first. Mr. Ray stated that
                        the Chinese had made up their list and that the list included 900 tons of
                        automotive spare parts, tires and servicing equipment, and 1,100 tons of
                        small arms ammunition for General Hu Tsung-nan. Mr. Ray remarked that it was
                        perhaps significant that in the eyes of the Chinese the most important item
                        to be shipped in on the very first lot of supplies transported over this
                        route was a consignment of over a thousand tons of ammunition to the general
                        detailed by Chungking to hem in and watch the Chinese Communists.</p>

                            Sinkiang overland supply route from India to China.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>As Mr. Hull will be aware, the limited capacity of the Burma road and
                            of the air route from India has made it necessary to envisage the
                            possible need of an additional high capacity supply route to China. With
                            a view eventually to meeting this need, steps have been taken to develop
                            the Sinkiang route, and, as this route may shortly begin operating on a
                            small scale, consideration has been given by the appropriate departments
                            of His Majesty’s Government to the necessity for proper maintenance of
                            the roads. It has been established that transport and vehicle repair
                            facilities can only be obtained with great difficulty, and it is
                            considered undesirable that unnecessary strain should be thrown on these
                            facilities by the bad condition of the roads.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Sir R. Campbell is informed that the recently opened route has only
                            been used by a small volume of traffic, and it is probable that some
                            survey and maintenance work will be necessary if the present target of
                            capacity (2,000 tons per month) is to be reached and maintained
                            efficiently. It should also be remembered in considering the importance
                            of maintaining the roads in good order, that the figure of 2,000 tons a
                            month is not necessarily the maximum which the route may eventually have
                            to carry.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Sir R. Campbell accordingly has the honour to inform Mr. Hull that His
                            Majesty’s Government are proposing to put the above views to the Chinese
                            Government, with the recommendation that they should, in cooperation
                            with the Soviet Government (in so far as this may be required), take
                            such steps as may be necessary for the repair and maintenance of
                            Sections IV and V of the Sinkiang route. Should the Chinese Government
                            make a request for the services of road experts to advise, His Majesty’s
                            Government would be very willing to cooperate in lending such
                            assistance.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Before making such an approach to the Chinese Government, however, His
                            Majesty’s Government are anxious to learn whether the United States
                            Government concur in the action proposed, and Sir R. Campbell would be
                            grateful if he might receive from Mr. Hull an early indication of the
                            views of the United States Government on this matter.</item>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Subject: Sinkiang Route to China</p>
                    <p>I asked Mr. Ray to call so that I might ascertain informally the reaction of
                        the Lend-Lease Administration to the British memorandum No. 534 of August 19
                        on the above subject. Mr. Ray brought Mr. McCann with him.</p>
                    <p>After Mr. Ray and Mr. McCann had read the communication they both said that
                        it looked to them as if the British were anxious to make use of the new road
                        as a pretext for obtaining the entry of British nationals into Sinkiang, an
                        objective which the British have vainly attempted to accomplish for some
                        time.</p>
                    <p>I stated briefly that in the view of this Department our primary interest in
                        the proposed route is with respect to its political aspects. I said that I
                        thought it likely that, having that point in mind, the Department would be
                        inclined to reply to the communication under reference by saying that it was
                        a question between China and Great Britain as to whether the Chinese desire
                        to have British road experts come out to China to help with the repair and
                        maintenance of the Chinese portion of the new road, that this Department has
                        at all times considered the project as being more important from a political
                        than from an economic or military point of view, and that this Government
                        was not undertaking to associate itself with any initiative which the
                        British might take along the lines indicated in their memorandum of August
                        19.</p>
                    <p>Mr. McCann and Mr. Ray expressed general agreement with a reply of the kind
                        indicated. Mr. Ray, however, said that he hoped the Department would not
                        feel that it had to stress the military and economic unimportance of the
                        road. He said that the War Department uniformly takes the position that all
                        supplies for the Chinese theater must be under the direct control of
                        American military authorities. As a result only minor quantities of supplies
                        for China can be got to China and these only by great effort. Furthermore
                        the War Department attitude makes it difficult even to plan now for larger
                        supplies for China to be sent when transportation permits. This issue is at
                        present acute with respect to trucks. Lend-Lease is recommending urgently
                        that the War Production Board now schedule for production in the <pb n="610" xml:id="pg_610" facs="0620"/>first six months of 1944 some of the heavy
                        trucks which the Chinese have long been requesting. The Chinese have asked
                        for 10,000 trucks, a figure which Lend-Lease considers entirely reasonable
                        in view of the fact that trucks imported into China from the United States
                        alone in 1941 totaled 13,000 and in view of the further fact that no trucks
                        whatsoever have been imported into China in 1942 and so far in 1943. The
                        Army opposes the scheduling of the production of any trucks for China in
                        1944. Mr. Ray and Mr. McCann pointed out that even if the Lend-Lease
                        recommendation is adopted no trucks can be got to China for China’s own use
                        until the very latter part of 1944 or sometime in 1945 at the earliest by
                        which time China’s internal transportation system will be still more
                        critical. Lend-Lease is well aware that even in late 1944 and in 1945 almost
                        all traffic that will go to China directly from India will be under U.S.
                        Army control and the bulk of that will necessarily be for U.S. Army
                        utilization. They therefore consider it important that the Northwest route
                        be regarded as a means of getting lend-lease trucks into China for Chinese
                        use.</p>
                    <p>I told Mr. Ray that in my opinion the Department felt quite strongly that the
                        Northwest route was not economically important and might even be regarded as
                        disadvantageous in as much as it could in fact be regarded as a diversion of
                        effort and interest from more direct routes to China from India.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray took with him a copy of the British memorandum and said that he would
                        let me know promptly if the Lend-Lease Administration wished to make any
                        further comments. He also undertook to find out for me who might be an
                        appropriate official in the War Department with whom the matter might be
                        discussed informally in an effort to ascertain the War Department’s
                        reaction.</p>

                    <p>A copy of the British communication of August 19 was left with Colonel Wood
                        and a brief indication was given of the present attitude of the Department
                        as indicated in a memorandum of conversation with Mr. Ray of the Lend-Lease
                        Administration dated August 27.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Wood said that he thought the War Department had much the same view
                        of the route that this Department has and that so far as he could see a
                        reply along the lines suggested would be suitable. It was agreed that if
                        after further consideration the War Department had any suggestions to make
                        Colonel Pennoyer would call Mr. Hiss some time next Monday (August 30).</p>
                    <p>Colonel Pennoyer subsequently telephoned to say the War Department had no
                        further comments to make with respect to the Department’s proposed reply. He
                        said, however, that he had some question as to whether we should indicate
                        that our approval of plans relating to the proposed route depended solely on
                        political considerations. At this point I reminded him that the formula
                        which the Department has had in mind should not give rise to any such
                        implication. I said that according to my understanding of the Department’s
                        view, political considerations outweigh the economic potentialities of the
                        route. It is not our view that political considerations are the sole reasons
                        for the assistance which the United States has agreed to contribute, in form
                        of trucks. Colonel Pennoyer went on to say that in any event he thought on
                        such a question as that the judgment of this Department should be
                        controlling and would be satisfactory to the War Department. He also said
                        that the War Department was heartily in favor of it being made clear that
                        this Government would not wish any new approach to the Chinese by the
                        British to have the appearance of involving this Government in any
                        additional commitments with respect to the furnishing of trucks or other
                        supplies for the operation of this route.</p>

                        learn whether the United States Government concurs in a proposal to make
                        certain representations to the Chinese Government with respect to the
                        Sinkiang overland supply route from India to China.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary of State wishes to express his appreciation of the courtesy of
                        His Majesty’s Government in seeking this Government’s <pb n="612" xml:id="pg_612" facs="0622"/>views regarding the proposed action. No
                        objection is perceived to the making by the British Government of the
                        approach which that Government has in contemplation and the recommendation
                        indicated. With reference to the expression of willingness on the part of
                        His Majesty’s Government to make available to the Chinese Government, should
                        that Government so request, the services of road experts, this matter would
                        seem to be one for determination between the Chinese Government and His
                        Majesty’s Government.</p>
                    <p>This Government regards as important the development of supply routes to
                        China and it offers no objection to any efforts by other Governments in
                        cooperation with the Chinese Government which those Governments may think
                        practicable. His Majesty’s Government will recall, however, that from the
                        beginning of consideration of the proposed northwest supply route from India
                        to China it has been the view of this Government that neither the military
                        nor the economic potentialities of this route are likely to be,
                        comparatively speaking, great. In view of its opinion that development of
                        other routes would offer more of an advantage to the United Nations’ war
                        effort than development of this route, this Government would prefer not to
                        be associated, either directly or by implication, in any approach which the
                        British Government or any other Government might make to the Chinese in
                        promotion of the idea of diverting expert service, materials, et cetera, to
                        the development of this route.</p>

                        ship Chinese supplies over this route on the grounds that they cannot handle

                        conveyed into China in order that computation of charges might be made.
                        Counselor said that Chinese Ambassador had as yet received no reply from
                        Foreign Office. He expressed opinion Chinese Government would find

                    <p>69. 1. The Office of Lend-Lease Administration desires to send Mr. Gordon
                        Bowles, an American citizen, to China, via India, Afghanistan and Russia, to
                        explore motorable routes. He would be accompanied by an American mechanic.
                        They would travel in a truck and a small passenger vehicle. They hope to
                        leave the United States for India in the near future, to proceed thence to
                        Afghanistan, and to cross the Soviet-Afghan border in January at Termes or
                        Kelif on the Amu Darya.</p>
                    <p>2. If necessary, please take such steps as may be appropriate to obtain
                        permission for Bowles and mechanic to make the desired journey through
                        Afghanistan.</p>
                    <p>3. For your information, Bowles plans for arrangements, through the Soviet
                        Embassy at Kabul, for chauffeurs and assistants for travel through the
                        Soviet Union.</p>

                        Bowles to India to explore the motorable routes from India through
                        Afghanistan and Russian Turkestan to China with a view to developing a new
                        supply route to China.</p>
                    <p>This new all-motor route to China would supplement rather than supplant the
                        motor-rail route via Baluchistan, Iran and Russian Turkestan which is now
                        under joint discussion by the Soviet, Chinese and British Governments.<note n="1" xml:id="d534fn1">For correspondence on this subject, see <ref target="#pg_590">pp. 590</ref> ff.</note>

                    <p>It is proposed that Bowles would cross the Soviet-Afghan border in January at

                    <p>His proposed itinerary within the Soviet Union involves travel by motor from
                        Afghan border to Tashkent. Side trips from Tashkent by rail to Ashkabad and
                        return and to Stalinabad and return. From Tashkent by motor to Frunze and
                        Alma Ata and the Soviet border on the Julja road or via the Ferghana to Osh
                        and the Sinkiang border south of Naryn.</p>
                    <p>The services of chauffeurs and assistants would be necessary in Soviet
                        territory. The request for such personnel to be made available at the point
                        of entry will be made through the Soviet Embassy at Kabul. Permission also
                        required to purchase necessary fuel and supplies. In order to develop
                        information on the carrying capacity of bridges and general road conditions,
                        permission is desired to photograph under supervision the road and road
                        facilities along the route to be traveled.</p>
                    <p>Please request permission for Bowles and mechanic to make the desired journey
                        for the purpose indicated and request that the necessary facilities outlined
                        above be granted him. In making this request you should point out to the
                        Foreign Office that the purpose of developing an all-motor route to China is
                        to relieve the Soviet railways and that this projected route is shorter by
                        some five hundred miles than the other route to China under discussion at
                        this time.</p>

                    <p>1144. Department’s 622, December 9, 9 p.m. The following represents the
                        pertinent excerpts from a note, number 102, dated December 25, 1942, which
                        has been received from the Foreign Office: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“The question of the possible passage of automobile routes through
                                Soviet territory for supplying China, and in this connection the
                                study of general road conditions and the capacity of bridges, is
                                being referred to the appropriate Soviet organs which, in the event
                                the question arises in the future will be in a position themselves
                                to gather the required information.</p>
                            <p>Therefore the Soviet authorities do not see any necessity for a
                                special study of road conditions in the regions of Soviet Central
                                Asia by Mr. Gordon Bowles.”</p>

                    <p>32. The Foreign Secretary has confidentially given me the attitude of the
                        British Government and the Government of India on the possible establishment
                        of supply routes through Afghanistan (Department’s 701, December 10, 10
                        p.m.)</p>
                    <p>In essence it is to the effect that when the British and Soviet Governments
                        requested that the Axis non-diplomatic nationals be deported from
                        Afghanistan the Afghan Government required and received assurances in
                        writing from the British and Soviet Governments that its acquiescence would
                        not be followed by a demand for supply routes through Afghanistan; that the
                        Grand Assembly subsequently in confirming the deportation resolved that
                        under no conditions would the use of air or land routes be granted; and that
                        an attempt to establish such routes might undermine the present regime in
                        Afghanistan and lead to serious disorders.</p>
                    <p>He states that the British Minister at Kabul has been instructed to explain
                        this attitude to Engert. Since the latter will doubtless telegraph the
                        details I shall not do so unless so instructed.</p>

                    <p>13. Referring to Delhi’s telegram<note n="5" xml:id="d538fn5">
                     <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> in reply to your 701, December 10.
                        British Minister had conveyed to me substantially same information in
                        connection with proposed journey of Gordon Bowles. Government of India seems
                        to apprehend unfavorable repercussions on Afghan Government and possibly
                        frontier tribes if it should become known that we were actively
                        investigating possibility of opening routes via Afghanistan. I understand
                        London instructed British Embassy, Washington, to bring these considerations
                        to your attention. Since your January 11,<note n="6" xml:id="d538fn6">Not
                            printed.</note> I have heard from my British colleague<note n="7" xml:id="d538fn7">Sir F. V. Wylie, the British Minister.</note> that
                        Bowles is to travel via Afghanistan to Persia and back again to India and
                        thence to China. Please confirm.</p>
                    <p>My dispatch 33, September 16, 1942,<note n="6" xml:id="d538fn1">Not
                            printed.</note> described circumstances attending expulsion of Axis
                        nationals in 1941. Am sending copy to Delhi. See especially bottom of page
                        3, part of page 4 and page 10. Please note incidentally that Soviets never
                        gave any assurances re supply routes and that Britain merely promised not to
                        open such routes without cooperation of Afghans.</p>
                    <p>Should it become necessary to open trans-Afghan routes to Russia or China, I
                        feel it would be up to British and Soviet representatives and me to make
                        sure that Afghan cooperation will be forthcoming.</p>

                    <p>55. Government of India has learned from Washington that Bowles having been
                        refused a visa for Soviet Russia may now wish to proceed to China over the
                        Karakoram Pass and through Sinkiang. (Department’s 701, December 10, 10
                        p.m.). The Foreign Office suggests that if it is his intention to proceed on
                        that trip more or less immediately after his arrival in India there would be
                        no advantage in his proceeding <pb n="618" xml:id="pg_618" facs="0628"/>to
                        India until April since the Karakoram route is not normally open much before
                        May. It adds that this may be a point of importance in view of the

                    <p>58. Bowles departed for India before your no. 55 of January 21 was received.
                        The difficulties likely to be encountered in Afghanistan were brought to his
                        attention before his departure, however, and he stated that he would contact
                        Engert before embarking upon any plans. The views of the British Government
                        on this subject were brought to our attention by the British Embassy.</p>

                        Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Iran, and China to explore motorable routes
                        through Russian Turkestan and Afghanistan with view to opening up new
                        channel for supply of goods to China to supplement motor-rail route via
                        Baluchistan, Iran and Russian Turkestan, which is now under joint discussion
                        by Soviet, Chinese and British governments.</p>
                    <p>Since Soviet Embassy has not granted visas to Bowles and mechanic, they will
                        explore routes only as far as Soviet border. They plan to proceed first to
                        New Delhi; thence through Kabul to Afghan frontier posts opposite Soviet
                        border. They then plan to return to New Delhi and proceed thence through
                        Baluchistan and eastern Iran to Meshed and Soviet border and return. After
                        return to New Delhi they plan to proceed through one of Northwest Indian
                        frontier passes (Kilik, Mintaka, etc.) to Yarkand and Kashgar by caravan and
                        thence to Chungking. Bowles departed from Washington January 12.</p>
                    <p>Please inform Chinese Foreign Office of Bowles’ proposed trip to ascertain
                        whether or not they have any objection, and, if they have no objection,
                        request any steps deemed advisable to facilitate Bowles’ travels in Chinese
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>BEW is contemplating sending procurement mission to China. If mission has
                        been dispatched by time Bowles reaches Chungking, he will be attached to it
                        as assistant to the head of the mission. Otherwise he will return to the
                        United States from Chungking.</p>
                    <p>You are authorized to pay expenses of despatching official cables for Bowles.
                        Charges incurred should be included in your accounts accordance Section V–45
                        for reimbursement by BEW accordance authorization contained in their letter
                        of November 24, 1942.</p>

                    <p>75. Chinese Commissioner, just returned from consultation at Chungking, says
                        no supplies have yet been shipped to China through Tibet. Practicability of
                        this route is now being reconsidered in Chungking and from Commissioner’s
                        remarks it is inferred decision of Chinese Government likely to be negative
                        (reference Department’s 41, January 22, 11 p.m.).</p>
                    <p>Commissioner believes that after allowing for essential Tibetan traffic the
                        actual annual capacity of this route, so far as through shipment <pb n="621" xml:id="pg_621" facs="0631"/>to China is concerned, would be nearer
                        1,000 tons than the 3 to 4,000 originally estimated.</p>
                    <p>Political difficulties are also involved. Tibetans are uncooperative
                        apparently distrusting intentions of both India and China and fearing undue
                        expansion of their influence. India lays blame for this attitude on China,
                        and vice versa. Tibetans apparently made difficulties over proposed
                        stationing of British, Indian and Chinese officials along route to check
                        shipments and for a time consideration was given to possibility of turning
                        goods over to ordinary caravans for unsupervised transportation to Chinese
                        border. A trial shipment of 50 tons was made ready in India but is being
                        held up pending Chungking decision expected within a month.</p>

                            mailed.<note n="6" xml:id="d545fn6">Not printed; for correspondence on

                        quotes Foreign Office official here as saying Government of India has no

                        on basis of joint arrangements with both Chinese and Tibetan Governments.
                        Bowles understands from Chinese Commissioner that his Government,
                        considering Tibet an integral part of China, will reject any proposal for
                        tripartite negotiations including Tibetan Government. Commissioner believes
                        China will not sacrifice principle involved for the small quantity of goods
                        which might thus be received.</p>

                    <p>On the 21st day of 12th month, the year of Water Horse (corresponding to
                        January 1943), you two came to the Foreign Office and brought a letter. We
                        sent it to the Regent through Kashag. When you arrived at Delhi the British
                        Foreign Office, through Mr. Ludlow, said that two American gentlemen wanted
                        to come to Tibet with the purpose of giving a letter and present to the
                        Dalai Lama from Mr. Roosevelt. When the letters would be delivered you
                        promised to return to India if the Tibetan Government does not want you to
                        go to China. Now you said that you have received a telegram from the
                        American Government saying that you must go to Kansu Country of Lanchow, and
                        ask Tibetan Government to allow you to go straight to China.</p>
                    <p>This is the first time that friendly relations were established between Tibet
                        and the U. S. A. and Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt also has sent letter and
                        presents to the Dalai Lama. For above reasons the Tibetan Government allows
                        you to go through and will not set a precedent which other foreigners can
                        claim. So according to your wishes, you and your servants can proceed via
                        Nagchu to Jyekundo and up to Sining. There are many dangers from robbers and
                        thieves, so we are sending one of our monk officials or lay officer and one
                        sergeant of Tashi Fort and 5 soldiers by the order of the Tibetan
                        Government.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. President</hi>: We received with the greatest
                        gratification your letter and the tokens of goodwill (your autographed photo
                        and an exquisite gold watch showing phases of the moon and the days of the
                        week) through your Envoys, Capt. I. Tolstoy and Lieut. Brooke Dolan, who
                        arrived here safely for the purpose of visiting the Pontificate and the city
                        of Lhasa.</p>
                    <p>We are happy to learn that you and the people of the United States of America
                        take great interest in our country and it is of special significance that
                        the people of the United States of America, in association with those of 27
                        other countries, are now engaged in a war for the preservation of freedom,
                        which has been thrust upon them by nations bent on conquest who are intent
                        upon destroying freedom of thought, of religion, and of action
                        everywhere.</p>
                    <p>Tibet also values her freedom and independence enjoyed from time immemorial
                        and being the great seat of the Buddhist religion I am endeavoring, in spite
                        of my tender age, to uphold and propagate our religious precepts and thereby
                        emulate the pious work of my predecessors. I earnestly hope and pray for a
                        speedy termination of hostilities so that the nations of the world may enjoy
                        a lasting and righteous peace, based on the principles of freedom and
                        goodwill.</p>
                    <p>As a token of my regard I am sending herewith a scarf of honour, three
                        Tibetan coins of the first precious metal (gold), my photo, and three hand
                        sewn thangas (depicting the sextet blessed with long existence, the 4
                        dutiful brothers (friends), and the 8 lucky signs, all framed in blue
                        brocade silk, etc.).</p>

                    <p>Colonel M. Preston Goodfellow of O.S.S. called me on the telephone and said
                        that the two men from O.S.S. sent to Tibet have reported that the Cabinet of
                        Tibet has through them requested a complete radio transmitting set for use
                        for broadcasting within Tibet. Colonel Goodfellow went on to say that O.S.S.
                        has such a set which could be made available for this purpose, and that
                        Colonel Donovan and others in O.S.S. consider that the two men now in Tibet
                        have done a good job of establishing friendly relations with the Tibetan
                        authorities and that it would be helpful to our war effort in “the general
                        area” if the set should be sent. Colonel Goodfellow asked whether I thought
                        the Department of State would be interested in this question and upon my
                        saying that in my opinion we would, he asked me to ascertain informally the
                        views of the Department or the manner in which the Department would like to
                        have the question raised with it by O.S.S. I undertook to do this and to
                        inform him of the results of my inquiries as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>Reference the suggestion made by the Office of Strategic Services to ship to
                        Tibet a radio transmitter which the Cabinet Ministers of the Tibetan
                        Government have requested through the two representatives of the Office of
                        Strategic Services who are now in that country.</p>
                    <p>After careful consideration of this matter in so far as it may affect our
                        relations with China, we are of the opinion that to supply a radio
                        transmitting set to the Tibetans would be politically embarrassing and cause
                        irritation and offense to the Chinese for the following reasons: <list>
                            <label>(1)</label>
                            <item>In November 1941 the Chinese requested that we allocate under
                                Lend-Lease and ship to them a radio transmitter. This request we
                                have not complied with because of shipping and air transport
                                limitations.</item>
                            <label>(2)</label>
                            <item>The question of supplying China with the equipment she desires is
                                a particularly delicate one at the present time. It is almost
                                certain that to supply the Tibetans with a radio transmitter when we
                                have <pb n="625" xml:id="pg_625" facs="0635"/>failed to meet a
                                similar request made by the Chinese over a year ago would give
                                offense to the Chinese.</item>
                            <label>(3)</label>
                            <item>The Chinese Government claims suzerainty over Tibet. Therefore, in
                                all probability, the Chinese Government would not welcome the
                                introduction into Tibet of such a potent facility as a radio
                                transmitter, particularly as the Chinese are not likely to have any
                                actual control over the transmitter or the material
                                broadcasted.</item>
                            <label>(4)</label>
                            <item>The Chinese probably have no objection to and may even welcome the
                                dispatch of American “visitors” to Tibet from time to time but it is
                                hardly conceivable that they would look with favor upon our
                                supplying the Tibetans with any equipment which might be used
                                against them in any way.</item>
                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>We therefore recommend, from the point of view of our relations with China,
                        that these considerations be brought to the attention of the Office of
                        Strategic Services; that that agency be urged to drop the proposal to ship a
                        radio transmitter to the Tibetans and that some other gift be substituted
                        therefor.</p>

                    <p>I called Colonel Goodfellow and informed him of the view which had been
                        expressed by officers of the Department. I then asked him whether O.S.S.
                        would desire to receive the Department’s views in some more formal manner
                        stating that unless O.S.S. should decide to drop the matter of sending
                        transmitting station to Tibet, I believed that the Department would wish to
                        press its objections more strenuously.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Goodfellow was most agreeable and reasonable about the matter and
                        seemed to perceive the cogency of the objections to the proposed action. He
                        said that he would pass our views on to the interested officials in the
                        O.S.S. and that he would let me know if there was any disposition to
                        continue favorable consideration of the project.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Goodfellow made only one statement of significance that we have not
                        already been familiar with. He said that it had been the thought in O.S.S.
                        that the transmitter would be available in Tibet for American use. I did not
                        comment on this point and he did not seem to think that it warranted any
                        reconsideration on our part.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Dr. Hornbeck</hi>: We have received a cable from
                        two of our representatives in Lhasa relaying a request by the National
                        Assembly and the Tibetan Cabinet that we obtain priorities so that they may
                        purchase three fully-equipped portable wireless stations to set up a
                        trans-Tibet network. These stations will be 100 watts each and the equipment
                        requested can be purchased for a total cost of $4500.</p>
                    <p>An historical precedent is broken by this request which, if complied with,
                        will open the Tibet region 1200 miles east and west for Allied influence and
                        further modernization of territory which will be strategically valuable in
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>Our authorities in New Delhi and the Government of India both agree in
                        principle.</p>
                    <p>We have the equipment which they have requested on hand in this office and
                        would like to provide it to the Tibetan Government as a gift from the United
                        States. I believe that this would have a very wholesome effect upon our
                        relations. We have furnished communications equipment to the Chinese in
                        excess of $50,000.</p>
                    <p>The two representatives of this office in Lhasa, through whom we received

                        States, which was received with much ceremony.</p>
                    <p>If you approve of our proposal, we will proceed to ship the equipment to our
                        representatives in Lhasa for presentation with the compliments of the United
                        States to the Tibetan Cabinet.</p>

                        China had always regarded Tibet as a part of the Republic, and that during
                        his visit to <pb n="627" xml:id="pg_627" facs="0637"/>India Chiang
                            Kai-shek<note n="12" xml:id="d553fn12">Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,
                            President of the Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier), visited India in
                            February 1942.</note> had not been wholly reassured by what he had
                        learnt of the attitude of the Government of India on this question. The
                        Generalissimo had said that when a suggestion had been made for opening up a
                        route through Tibet to China, the British Government had appeared reluctant
                        to agree. Mr. Eden replied that his impression was that the reluctance
                        referred to was caused by the physical difficulties involved and not by any
                        political ones. As, however, Mr. Eden was not sufficiently fully or recently
                        briefed on this subject, the point was not discussed further.</p>
                    <p>On receipt of an account of the above conversation the Viceroy<note n="13" xml:id="d553fn13">Marquess of Linlithgow.</note> has telegraphed from
                        New Delhi giving the facts on the Tibetan question and adding his comments
                        on Dr. Soong’s remarks regarding firstly, Tibet’s position on the map of
                        Asia, and secondly, the attitude of the Government of India to trans-Tibetan
                        communications. Lord Linlithgow adds that he does not consider that Dr.
                        Soong’s remarks represent accurately the real position, which is briefly as
                        follows.</p>
                    <p>I. Tibet acknowledged the suzerainty of the Manchu Empire: when,
                                however, that Empire fell the Tibetans expelled the Chinese troops
                                that were at that time in Lhasa and secured the return of the Dalai
                                Lama from China [<hi rend="italic">India?</hi>]. In 1913 a
                                Tripartite Conference was held in Simla between representatives of
                                Tibet and of the Chinese and British Governments in an endeavour to
                                resolve the existing differences relating both to the constitutional
                                position as between China and Tibet and to the boundaries separating
                                Tibet from India and China. The resulting convention, which was
                                initialled by the delegates of all three parties, recognised that
                                Tibet was under the suzerainty of China but acknowledged the
                                autonomy of Outer Tibet. The convention was ratified by Tibet and
                                the Government of India; the Chinese Republic, however, declined to
                                ratify and the Tibetan attitude has subsequently been that, in view
                                of this Chinese refusal, Tibet is not bound to admit Chinese
                                suzerainty and is an entirely independent state. In 1934 the Chinese
                                Government sent Huang Mu Sung to Lhasa on a mission of condolence on
                                the death of the thirteenth Dalai Lama; through Huang Tibet was
                                offered a settlement of the boundary issue in return for Tibetan
                                acceptance of subordination to China, with Chinese control of
                                Tibet’s foreign relations. This overture the Tibetan Government
                                rejected. Shortly before the installation of the new Dalai Lama in
                                1940 the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs,<note n="14" xml:id="d553fn14">Wang Chung-hui.</note> explaining the
                                intention to send a Chinese representative to the ceremonies, stated
                                that: “The representative has been instructed by the Chinese
                                Government to say that China would at all times be ready <pb n="628" xml:id="pg_628" facs="0638"/>to help Tibet, if Tibet desired it,
                                but that China promised not to interfere in the development of Tibet
                                along Tibetan lines”. The Minister of Foreign Affairs also said:
                                “The Tibetan Government must not continue to think that China has
                                any bad intentions towards Tibet”. The British representative who
                                attended the ceremonies was instructed to inform the Tibetan
                                Government of these statements of the Chinese Minister of Foreign
                                Affairs.</p>
                            <p>Ever since the abortive 1913 Convention the attitude of the
                                Government of India has been that they wished to secure agreement
                                between China and Tibet and were willing to advise the Tibetan
                                Government to admit formal Chinese suzerainty, although such an
                                admission would in no sense constitute Tibet a Province of China.
                                The Government of India have always held that Tibet is a separate
                                country in full enjoyment of local autonomy, entitled to exchange
                                diplomatic representatives with other powers. The relationship
                                between China and Tibet is not a matter which can be unilaterally
                                decided by China, but one on which Tibet is entitled to negotiate,
                                and on which she can, if necessary, count on the diplomatic support
                                of the British Government along the lines shown above.</p>
                        <p>II. On the question of trans-Tibetan communications, Lord Linlithgow
                            recalls that, for purely practical reasons of geography and meteorology,
                            the Government of India was unable to encourage the Chinese suggestion
                            of building a highway from Western Szechuan through Eastern Tibet to
                            Assam—a project which, if not entirely impossible, would have taken
                            years to complete. It should on the other hand be recalled that the
                            initiative for the organisation for a pack route from Kalimpong via
                            Central Tibet to China was taken by the Government of India. In spite of
                            two rebuffs from Lhasa, the Government of India persisted and was
                            finally successful. The Chinese Government on the other hand, although
                            their representative in Lhasa was kept informed of these negotiations,
                            made no effort to participate in them: when the time came to work out
                            practical details the Chinese Government made certain stipulations in
                            regard to supervision of this route by Chinese officials, stipulations
                            which the Tibetan Government were unable to accept. The Chinese
                            Government moreover opposed any form of tripartite agreement in which
                            the British Government would participate. In spite of this attitude
                            taken up by the Chinese Government, the Government of India did not
                            cease to exhort the Chinese Commissioner in India to continue his
                            efforts to despatch goods to China via Tibet through trade channels, and
                            promised all assistance from the Indian end. Lack of further progress
                            has been due to the unforthcoming attitude of the Chinese and to the
                            Tibetan Government’s suspicion of Chinese intentions.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear General Donovan</hi>: The receipt is
                        acknowledged of your secret letter of April 12, 1943, addressed to Mr.
                        Hornbeck, stating that you have received from two of your representatives in
                        Lhasa a cable relaying a request by the National Assembly and the Tibetan
                        Cabinet that you obtain priorities so that they may purchase three fully
                        equipped portable wireless stations to set up a trans-Tibet network; that
                        these stations will be 100 watts each and the equipment requested can be
                        purchased for a total cost of $4,500; and that you would like to provide
                        this equipment to the Tibetan Government as a gift from the United
                        States.</p>
                    <p>Tibet is, as you know, regarded by the Chinese as a dependency of China, and
                        the Government of the United States has never taken action in contravention
                        or disregard of that Chinese view. The susceptibilities of the Chinese
                        Government are of importance to this country and to the United Nations in
                        connection with the war effort as a whole. It therefore is desirable, in any
                        relations which we may have with the Tibetan authorities or in any action
                        which we may take vis-à-vis them, to avoid gratuitously or inadvertently
                        giving offense to the Chinese Government. In the light of those facts, it is
                        believed that effort should be made to ascertain whether supplying of this
                        equipment by this Government to the Tibetan Government as a contribution to
                        the war effort would or would not be likely to offend Chinese
                        susceptibilities. It therefore is suggested that this matter be referred
                        through the War Department to General Stilwell. If, then, it is ascertained
                        that the proposed action appears to be unobjectionable from the point of
                        view referred to above, this Department would suggest that the project under
                        reference be regarded thereafter as a military matter and that decision be
                        made on that basis.</p>

                        transportation through its territory of non-military supplies for China.</p>
                    <pb n="630" xml:id="pg_630" facs="0640"/>
                    <p>Chinese representatives here were not aware that these arrangements had been
                        concluded until press article appeared, and they believe Chungking was
                        similarly uninformed. They have subsequently been told that Government of
                        India pressed Tibet to act favorably on this long standing question on
                        grounds that continued refusal would lead to serious deterioration in
                        relations between Tibet and China. Tibet finally agreed but only on
                        condition that (1) no military supplies of any sort be thus transported; and
                        (2) no foreign supervision of shipments while in Tibet would be permitted.
                        It accordingly does not appear likely that Lend-Lease goods will be shipped
                        from India to China via Tibet. In opinion Chinese officers here, the route
                        with annual capacity estimated at from 1 to 3000 tons will probably be used
                        only for Chinese civilian supplies purchased in India.</p>

                        Government of India in regard to the Tibetan question and with developments
                        in the project of a pack animal supply route to China via Tibet.</p>
                    <p>The Government of the United States has made note of the steps taken and the
                        attitude shown by the Government of India toward establishing a supply route
                        to China through Tibet. This Government of course hopes that any existing
                        difficulties may be resolved in a way acceptable to all concerned.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the position of Tibet in Asia, the British Government has been
                        so good as to give an account of its historical attitude. For its part, the
                        Government of the United States has borne in mind the fact that the Chinese
                        Government has long claimed suzerainty over Tibet and that the Chinese
                        constitution lists Tibet among areas constituting the territory of the
                        Republic of China. This Government has at no time raised a question
                        regarding either of these claims. The Government of the United States does
                        not believe that a useful purpose would be served by opening at this time a
                        detailed discussion of the status of Tibet.</p>

                    <p>344. I was informed by Weightman, Joint Secretary External Affairs, in
                        strictest confidence this morning that the announcement regarding a route
                        through Tibet reported in my 340, May 14 was made at this time in order that
                        China might not attempt to justify any aggression against Tibet by saying
                        that all possibility of transport from India across Tibet was denied China.
                        British Government had endeavored last August to persuade Tibetan
                        authorities to open such a route and latter had said they would do so only
                        if a tripartite agreement between Tibet, China and India were reached.
                        Chinese Government had declined to consider such an agreement on ground that
                        Tibet is considered a part of China. As a result of the announcement,
                        Weightman states, [that?] Generalissimo recently made of his intention of
                        retaking all lost territory including Tibet and of a report heard through “a
                        leak” to effect that [he?] ordered governors of Sikang, Yunnan and Chinghai
                        to send troops to Tibetan border (only the last mentioned complying),
                        British through their Mission at Lhasa successfully prevailed upon the
                        Tibetans to agree to consent to the use of a route under the conditions
                        mentioned in my telegram 340.</p>
                    <p>Weightman believes that Embassy in Chungking has been informed of information
                        obtained through the leak and that British Ambassador in Washington<note n="15" xml:id="d557fn15">Viscount Halifax.</note> has discussed matter
                        with Department.</p>
                    <p>I have just received a letter from Tolstoy dated Sog, Tibet, April 17 in
                        which he says that he had heard night before that Tibetan and Chinese troops
                        are advancing toward each other and that Chinese troops had received their
                        orders from Central Government. He also had heard a rumor from a Tibetan
                        officer that Chinese had asked Government to invade Tibet and had been
                        refused. Weightman states that no such request was received.</p>
                    <p>Tolstoy has apparently informed British at Lhasa that he is reporting on
                        situation in a telegram which is presumably one Mission is relaying to <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi> under today’s date. Weightman requests that
                        substance of this telegram be retransmitted here in one of Mission’s codes
                        or conveyed to British Embassy in Washington.</p>

                    <p>633. British Embassy here has received information from British Embassy at
                        Chungking to the effect that a force of 10,000 Chinese troops has been
                        concentrated along the Tibetan borders. British Embassy stated this
                        information is based on a report received from “an American officer”<note n="17" xml:id="d558fn17">Lt. S. H. Hitch, Assistant Naval Attaché in
                            China.</note> who recently returned to Chungking from Sining, Chinghai.
                        It has also been learned from the British Embassy that this report has
                        caused the British Government some concern and that in consequence the
                        British Ambassador recently called on the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs
                        to discuss this matter; that the Vice Minister indicated he had no
                        information substantiating this report but took occasion to reiterate the
                        position of the Chinese Government vis-à-vis Tibet.</p>
                    <p>The Department would appreciate receiving any information the Embassy may
                        have in regard to the foregoing, but desires that you not make inquiries in
                        this connection except very discreetly in official American circles.</p>

                    <p>777. Department’s 633, May 18, 7 p.m. American officer referred to is an
                        Assistant Naval Attaché who visited Sining briefly in latter part of April
                        in company with an Assistant Military Attaché. Information given former by
                        Secretary of Chinghai Government was that 10,000 Chinghai troops had been
                        moved toward Tibetan border (actual location is probably north border of
                        Sikang as shown on Chinese maps) in obedience to Generalissimo’s orders.
                        Governor of Sikang is also understood to have been asked to permit passage
                        of Central Government troops toward Tibet or in lieu of this to despatch his
                        own troops. Governor Liu Wen-hui has reportedly refused to do either (see
                        New Delhi’s 344, May 15, 7 p.m.).</p>
                    <p>Chinese objectives in these moves seem to be: (1) to bring pressure on Tibet
                        to permit opening two nd [<hi rend="italic">to the?</hi>] Central Government
                        [and?] control of transportation routes and transit of military supplies
                        (Tibetans apparently remain intransigent on this question and <pb n="633" xml:id="pg_633" facs="0643"/>in 1942 attacked Ministry of Communications
                        route survey party, killing chief); (2) to gain a foothold for the Central
                        Government in the presently independent province of Sikang and Chinghai; (3)
                        eventually to bring Tibet under effective Chinese control. Chinese pretext
                        is that Tibetans instigated by Japanese agents and aided by Japanese arms
                        and planes are planning offensive action against Chinese border
                        provinces.</p>
                    <p>While there is some basis for belief in presence in Tibet of a few Japanese
                        agents, reports of Japanese activity and Tibetan aggressiveness are believed
                        exaggerated.</p>
                    <p>In their present nationalistic state of mind the Chinese may be expected to
                        resent any active British interest in Tibetan affairs.</p>

                    <p>Sir George Sansom<note n="19" xml:id="d560fn19">British Minister.</note>
                        called at my request and I told him that we had received a telegram dated
                        May 15 from our Mission in New Delhi (New Delhi’s 344, May 15, 7 p.m.) in
                        which telegram it was stated (1) that the American representative at Lhasa
                        had informed the British that he was reporting on the situation in Tibet and
                        (2) that Weightman, Joint Secretary of External Affairs at New Delhi, had
                        requested that the substance of that report be conveyed to the British
                        Embassy in Washington. I told Sir George that we had made inquiry of the War
                        Department and had obtained a paraphrase of a telegram which embodied the
                        report apparently referred to (a message from Ferris,<note n="20" xml:id="d560fn20">Brig. Gen. Benjamin G. Ferris, Acting Chief of Staff
                            to General Stilwell.</note> dated New Delhi, May 16, to the War
                        Department). I let Sir George read the telegram. He said that he had had
                        practically all of the information in the telegram except the statement
                        contained in the last sentence to the effect that according to the British
                        the reincorporation of Tibet was among the objectives laid down by General
                        Chiang Kai-shek in a book recently published, presumably by the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Sir George then told me that at a Pacific Council meeting in Washington on
                        May 20 Mr. T. V. Soong had said in reply to Mr. Churchill<note n="21" xml:id="d560fn21">Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister.</note> that
                        there was not and would not be a concentration of Chinese troops <pb n="634" xml:id="pg_634" facs="0644"/>against Tibet though the Chinese Government
                        claimed that Tibet was a part of China; and that the Prime Minister had
                        replied that no one contested Chinese suzerainty and that the essential
                        thing now was to avoid making any new difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Sir George also let me have an extract from a telegram dated May 25 from the
                        British Foreign Office. He said that the matter was of no importance but he
                        thought that the Tibetan reply quoted therein was rather amusing. This
                        extract was as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“As regards assurance concerning alleged Japanese activities in
                                Tibet, Tibetan reply states in part as follows. ‘Tibet being a
                                country entirely devoted to religion we rigorously guard our
                                frontiers from intrusion and emphatically deny having any dealings
                                or understandings with other foreign powers.’”</p>

                        and would not be massed on the Tibetan borders; and that the British Prime
                        Minister had rejoined that Chinese suzerainty over Tibet was not contested
                        by anyone but that it was essential at the present time to avoid any new
                        complications or difficulties.</p>

                    <p>(Policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Tibetan relations with
                        China).</p>
                    <p>Until the Chinese Revolution of 1911 Tibet acknowledged the suzerainty of the
                        Manchu Empire and a measure of control from Peking which fluctuated from
                        military occupation to a mere nominal link. Since 1911 Tibet has enjoyed <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> independence. His Majesty’s <pb n="635" xml:id="pg_635" facs="0645"/>Government made repeated attempts after
                        1911 to bring the Chinese Republic and the Tibetan Government together on
                        the basis that Tibet should be autonomous under the nominal suzerainty of
                        China, but these attempts always broke down on the question of the boundary
                        between China and Tibet, and eventually in 1921 His Majesty’s Government
                        presented the Chinese Government with a declaration to the effect that they
                        did not feel justified in withholding any longer their recognition of the
                        status of Tibet as an autonomous state under the suzerainty of China, and
                        that they intended dealing on that basis with Tibet in the future.</p>

                        <item>The Chinese Government have since 1921 attempted to an increasing
                            extent to import some substance into their suzerainty over Tibet, while
                            the Tibetans repudiate any measure of Chinese control. There have been
                            several recent indications that the Chinese Government intend to press
                            their claim that Tibet is part of China, and the point is likely to come
                            up whenever any question affecting Tibet is under discussion with the
                            Chinese Government. Thus, last year they proposed, contrary to the
                            wishes of the Tibetan Government, to post officials in Tibet to
                            supervise the organisation of a supply route to China, and when Mr. Eden
                            was in Washington in March, Dr. T. V. Soong said in connexion with this
                            route that his Government had always regarded Tibet as part of the
                            Republic of China.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government have reconsidered
                            their attitude towards this question, having regard in particular to the
                            consideration that any unconditional recognition of Chinese suzerainty
                            would weaken their position in defending Tibet’s claim to autonomy.
                            While they are bound by a promise to the Tibetan Government to support
                            them in maintaining the practical autonomy of Tibet, which is of
                            importance to the security of India and to the tranquility of India’s
                            north east frontier, on the other hand Great Britain’s alliance with
                            China makes it difficult to give effective material support to Tibet. It
                            is therefore desirable so far as possible to prevent the dispute between
                            China and Tibet regarding the latter’s status coming to a head at
                            present. Nevertheless, at some stage discussion with the Chinese
                            Government regarding this matter is probably inevitable. It has
                            therefore been decided that in any such discussions the following line
                            should be taken in so far as the circumstances render it necessary:— <list>

                                <item>It should be pointed out that Tibet has in practice regarded
                                    herself as autonomous and has maintained her autonomy for over
                                    30 years.</item>

                                <item>It can be stated categorically that neither His Majesty’s
                                    Government nor the Government of India have any ambitions in
                                    Tibet other than the maintenance of friendly relations.</item>

                                <item>It should be recalled that the attitude of His Majesty’s
                                    Government has always been that they recognize Chinese
                                    suzerainty, but that this is on the understanding that Tibet is
                                    regarded as autonomous.</item>
                                <label>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</label>
                                <item>It should be stated that this is still their position and any
                                    unconditional admission of Chinese suzerainty should be avoided.
                                    Any amicable arrangement which China felt disposed to make with
                                    Tibet whereby the latter recognised Chinese suzerainty in return
                                    for an agreed frontier and an undertaking to recognise Tibetan
                                    autonomy would be welcomed by His Majesty’s Government and the
                                    Government of India. The two latter Governments would be glad to
                                    offer any help desired by both parties to this end.</item>

                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>The foregoing would make it clear that His Majesty’s Government do not
                            feel themselves committed to regard China as the suzerain unless she in
                            turn agrees to Tibetan autonomy. For the present, it is better that the
                            matter should be left at that. But at a later stage it may prove
                            necessary to add that:— <list>

                        herewith a copy of despatch No. 7, July 10, 1943, from the Embassy officer
                        at Lanchow,<note n="24" xml:id="d563fn24">John S. Service; enclosure not
                            printed.</note> which was summarized in this airgram.</p>
                    <p>Especial attention is invited to the last paragraph of the despatch in which
                        Mr. Service describes the attitude of Captain Tolstoy and Lieutenant Dolan
                        as being strongly pro-Tibetan and critical of China and of what appear to be
                        Chinese intentions in regard to Tibet. During the course of a recent
                        conversation in Chungking with officers of the Embassy Captain Tolstoy
                        strongly intimated that he felt that <pb n="637" xml:id="pg_637" facs="0647"/>the United States should support the Tibetans vis-à-vis the Chinese
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>As of further interest in this connection it may be mentioned that during the
                        course of a recent conversation Dr. Victor Hoo, Vice Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs, stated confidentially that he had received reports to the effect
                        that Captain Tolstoy has assured the Tibetans that the United States would
                        support them in their desire to remain independent of China; that he was
                        very surprised at these reports because the United States had always shown a
                        “very correct attitude” in regard to Tibet; and that he would obtain more
                        specific information in the matter and communicate it to us in due
                        course.</p>

                    <p>Since the Chinese Revolution of 1911, when Chinese forces were withdrawn from
                        Tibet, Tibet has enjoyed <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> independence. She
                            <pb n="638" xml:id="pg_638" facs="0648"/>has ever since regarded herself
                        as in practice completely autonomous and has opposed Chinese attempts to
                        reassert control.</p>
                    <p>Since 1911, repeated attempts have been made to bring about an accord between
                        China and Tibet. It seemed likely that agreement could be found on the basis
                        that Tibet should be autonomous under the nominal suzerainty of China, and
                        this was the basis of the draft tripartite (Chinese-Tibetan-British)
                        convention of 1914 which was initialled by the Chinese representative but
                        was not ratified by the Chinese Government. The rock on which this
                        convention and subsequent attempts to reach an understanding were wrecked
                        was not the question of autonomy (which was expressly admitted by China) but
                        was the question of the boundary between China and Tibet, since the Chinese
                        Government claimed sovereignty over areas which the Tibetan Government
                        claimed belonged exclusively to their autonomous jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>The boundary question, however, remained insuperable and, since the delay in
                        reaching agreement was hampering the development of more normal relations
                        between India and Tibet, eventually in 1921 the Secretary of State for
                        Foreign Affairs (Lord Curzon) informed the then Chinese Minister (Dr.
                        Wellington Koo) that the British Government did not feel justified in
                        withholding any longer their recognition of the status of Tibet as an
                        autonomous State under the suzerainty of China, and intended dealing on this
                        basis with Tibet in the future.</p>
                    <p>This is the principle which has since guided the attitude of the British
                        Government towards Tibet. They have always been prepared to recognise
                        Chinese suzerainty over Tibet but only on the understanding that Tibet is
                        regarded as autonomous. Neither the British Government nor the Government of
                        India have any territorial ambitions in Tibet but they are interested in the
                        maintenance of friendly relations with, and the preservation of peaceful
                        conditions in, an area which is coterminous with the North-East frontiers of
                        India. They would welcome any amicable arrangements which the Chinese
                        Government might be disposed to make with Tibet whereby the latter
                        recognised Chinese suzerainty in return for an agreed frontier and an
                        undertaking to recognise Tibetan autonomy and they would gladly offer any
                        help desired by both parties to this end.</p>

                        Tibetans, who apparently want only to be left alone, (3) the British, who
                        oppose direct Chinese control over Tibet, and (4) the Chinese border war

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary</hi>. Information obtained from an advisor on
                            Tibetan affairs to the Szechwan Provincial Government and former minor
                            official in a border region of Tibet is to the effect that there are at
                            least eight Japanese bonzes living in Tibet but that they are so closely
                            watched that their activities are not dangerous to the cause of the
                            United Nations; that, probably in April of this year, Chiang Kai-shek
                            issued orders to the Chairmen of the three provinces bordering on Tibet
                            to move their troops further into Tibetan controlled areas; but that due
                            to lack of ability or desire on the part of the Chairmen the scheduled
                            “drive” amounted only to a few minor border incidents. This informant,
                            as well as President Y. P. Mei of Yenching University and another
                            Yenching professor with special knowledge of Tibet,<note n="30" xml:id="d566fn30">Professor Li An-che.</note> expressed the opinion
                            that any attempt to extend Chinese control over Tibet by force would be
                            bitterly resented by the Tibetans (enclosure No. 2). In background
                            “Notes on Tibet” (obtained from a British Indian official) written by a
                            private scholar who is said to have access to official British sources
                            of information (enclosure No. 3) the nationality and culture of the
                            Tibetans as distinct from those of the Chinese are stressed; mention is
                            made of the “British policy of supporting Tibetan independence or
                            complete autonomy …<note n="31" xml:id="d566fn31">Omissions indicated in

                            orderly conditions along the frontier”; and it is pointed out that as
                            “the new China” (as contrasted with the “Manchu dynastic empire”) “is
                            based on a purely Chinese nationalism and as Tibet … has now for a
                            generation been independent <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> of Chinese
                            rule, there does not seem to be any good ground on which China can now
                            assert an unqualified right of sovereignty …” A quotation from a
                            translation of <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi> by Chiang Kai-shek
                            (enclosure No. 4) indicates that the Generalissimo feels that China
                            should make “plans” for “the restoration of our national sovereignty”
                            over Tibet. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>

                    <p>There have been increasing indications in recent months that the Chinese
                        Central Government desires, and as soon as it feels in a position to, will
                        attempt to extend its control over Tibet by force of arms. It is almost a
                        foregone conclusion that Tibet will resist such encroachment by all means at
                        its command, including, presumably, appeals to Great Britain and to the
                        United States.</p>
                    <p>For over a quarter of a century Great Britain has opposed the exercise by
                        China of direct control over Tibet and there has been no indication that

                    <p>1340. Reference Embassy’s 777, May 25, 2 p.m., in regard to reported Chinese
                        troop concentrations along the Tibetan border.</p>
                    <p>1. British Embassy has brought to the Department’s attention a further
                                report received from the Government of India to the effect that the
                                strength of Chinese troops in the vicinity of Yushu, Chinghai, has
                                been considerably increased; that additional arms and supplies are
                                being shipped into that area; that the Tibetans are reported to have
                                increased their own forces and that considerable tension exists. The
                                Government of India has instructed its representatives at Lhasa to
                                endeavor to verify the above information and to suggest to the
                                Tibetan authorities that they take steps to prevent their own troops
                                from provoking frontier incidents.</p>
                            <p>This further report regarding Chinese troop concentrations in the
                                Chinghai–Tibet border area appears to be substantiated, at least in
                                part, by the information contained in the Embassy’s despatch no.
                                1482, August 17.</p>
                        <p>2. The Department suggests that the Embassy if it perceives no objection
                            make inquiry of the Foreign Office in regard to these reported troop
                            concentrations and discreetly indicate as on your own initiative a
                            concern over the possibility that these troop movements, if they are
                            actually being carried out, might result in armed clashes between
                            Chinese and Tibetan troops and furthermore that such an unfortunate
                            development could not fail adversely to affect the cooperative efforts
                            being made to defeat the Japanese and restore peace and tranquility in
                            the Far East.</p>

                        of a reassuring affirmation made by Soong of confidence on his part that
                        Chinese troops are not being concentrated in the area under reference and
                        that China will not initiate trouble there, together with statement by Soong
                        that China regards Tibet as “a part of China”.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the suggestion conveyed in numbered paragraph 2 of

                    <p>1817. Department’s 1340, September 21. At a suitable opportunity during a
                        dinner party on September 25 Counselor mentioned to Vice Foreign Minister
                        Victor Hoo that we had heard reports emanating from India to the effect that
                        there had been some additional troop concentrations on the Chinghai-Tibetan
                        border. Dr. Hoo did not at first deny the reports but said that the Chinese
                        troops “will certainly do nothing” and then said that there had been some
                        Chinese troops near the Tibetan border, that he had not heard this latest
                        report, and that the report was incorrect. He made a further statement that
                        “in any case we will do nothing”.</p>

                        Soong introduced the subject of Tibet. He said that while <pb n="642" xml:id="pg_642" facs="0652"/>in London he had talked with the BFO<note n="32" xml:id="d570fn32">British Foreign Office.</note> on that subject
                        and that a few days ago Sir George Sansom of the British Embassy here had
                        come to him under instructions and had spoken of the BFO’s uneasiness in the
                        presence of rumors that the Chinese were assembling troops on the Tibetan
                        border. Dr. Soong said that he had stated to Sir George that the Chinese
                        regard Tibet as an integral part of China; regard relations with the
                        Tibetans as an internal problem; and that, although he, Soong, is not fully
                        informed regarding troop movements, he doubts the rumors regarding massing
                        of troops, he is not aware of any reason why there should be trouble with
                        the Tibetans, etc., he would suggest that the British not make
                        representations at Chungking implying a special British interest in Tibetan
                        problems as problems involving an area or a people independent of China. Dr.
                        Soong went on to say that in their study of geography the Chinese have long
                        been taught that Tibet is a part of China and they have no thought whatever
                        that this is open to question; and he further said that the question of
                        Tibet is obviously of greater practical importance to the Chinese and the
                        Tibetans than to the people of any other country.</p>
                    <p>It was pointed out to Dr. Soong, without argumentation, that by virtue of its
                        geographical position, Tibet naturally is a subject of particular interest
                        not only to China but also to India. Dr. Soong readily admitted this but
                        affirmed that politically and in law Chinese claims regarding Tibet stand on
                        far firmer ground than do British claims.</p>
                    <p>If you have not already made an approach along the lines suggested in the
                        final paragraph of the Department’s 1340, September 21, 10 p.m. you are
                        authorized to leave in abeyance for the present any action on that
                        suggestion.</p>

                        there by the Chinese. He intimated that the fields are possibly for the
                        purpose of “pressure” to be applied later on. The informant remarked
                        incidentally that it was curious <pb n="643" xml:id="pg_643" facs="0653"/>how much trouble was taken over outlying regions such as Tibet and Outer

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that a director of
                        the China National Aviation Corporation in a confidential conversation has
                        informed me that the Calcutta office of the Corporation recently received a
                        communication from the Government of India authorities complaining that C.
                        N. A. C. planes have been flying over Tibet on the route between India
                        (Assam) and China, and that such flying over Tibet should be
                        discontinued.</p>
                    <p>I learn that in good weather the C. N. A. C. planes operating on the new
                        route between Assam and Suifu do at times fly over part of Tibet, taking a
                        route through a pass in the mountains with resulting greater safety for the
                        pilots, planes, and cargo.</p>
                    <p>The director of the Corporation tells me that he referred the matter to the
                        head office of the Corporation at Chungking, suggesting that for the time
                        being no reply be given to the letter of the Government of India authorities
                        and that if those authorities press the subject further they be informed by
                        the Calcutta office that it is not competent to deal with it and any
                        representations should be made to the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>The matter is reported for the confidential information of the Department as
                        a further small indication of British interest in Tibet as opposed to
                        China’s claim to suzerainty over that special area.</p>

                        despatch no. 1598, September 20, 1943 in regard to Sino–Tibetan relations
                        and to enclose a copy of despatch no. 170, October 28, 1943 from the Embassy
                        officer at Chengtu<note n="33" xml:id="d573fn33">Not printed.</note> in
                        regard to a proposed missionary sponsored educational <pb n="644" xml:id="pg_644" facs="0654"/>mission to Tibet.<note n="34" xml:id="d573fn34">E. H. Cressy of the National Christian Council of
                            China was sponsor of the proposed mission.</note> The despatch contains
                        a summary of its contents.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the alleged willingness of some Tibetans to welcome foreign
                        educational missionary work in their country, the Embassy has received no
                        information indicating that a relaxation may be expected of the well known
                        Tibetan policy of exclusion (see, for example, Embassy’s despatch no. 1482,
                        August 17, 1943). The history of missionary effort in China does not provide
                        any basis for assuming that the proposed educational mission under reference
                        (or the contemplated Seventh Day Adventist medical mission mentioned in Mr.
                        Smith’s despatch) is likely to be conducted with sufficient tact to avoid
                        arousing Tibetan opposition. The projects under reference may therefore very
                        well develop, even if the good intentions of the initiators are taken for
                        granted, into attempts at missionary penetration of Tibet which are likely
                        to give rise to Tibetan opposition and result in friction and situations
                        which cannot but be embarrassing to the American Government. It is also
                        possible that the missionary interests concerned may find it necessary, as
                        the price they must pay for indispensable Chinese support, to allow
                        themselves to be used to some extent as agents of Chinese political
                        penetration of Tibet.</p>
                    <p>The usual Chinese approach to the Tibetan problem is well illustrated by the
                        incident reported in the enclosure to the Embassy’s despatch no. 1793,
                        November 9, 1943.<note n="35" xml:id="d573fn35">Not printed.</note> Chinese
                        authorities in Kansu, wishing to discourage Tibetan assistance to rebels
                        operating in areas adjacent to those inhabited by Tibetans, dropped leaflets
                        in which the Tibetans were addressed as “barbarians” and threatened with
                        bombing if they sheltered rebels.</p>
                    <p>It is the Embassy’s opinion that under present conditions American interests
                        would not benefit from the missionary projects under reference but on the
                        contrary the projects might result in serious embarrassment to the
                        Government. Therefore, if and when the Embassy is approached by the
                        missionary interests concerned, we will expect to offer them no
                        encouragement in regard to the projects.</p>

                        Embassy with request that we accept for shipment by air from Kunming or
                        nearby airports 1 to 2000 tons of tin, shipment to be made during the next
                        few months. Dr. Wong, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, has
                        made a like request. The tin represents delayed delivery against NRC’s
                        1941–42 contract with Russians. Russian representative refers to his
                        understanding that we are allocating our tin from China to Russia and
                        suggests that we accord Chinese tin obligated directly to Russia priority
                        over tin under contract to United States. He points out that result will be
                        the same insofar as delivery of tin in India for Russia is concerned and
                        explains that procedure recommended would facilitate mutual accounting and
                        NRC’s task in discharging its obligations. Embassy requests reply indicating
                        whether Metals Reserve is prepared to give Russian tin priority position
                        requested. It now appears that air transport space to India will be adequate
                        to carry the tin and other strategic materials destined for United
                        States.</p>

                        supplies of antimony, wood oil or other materials readily available for the

                    <p>168. Department’s inquiry regarding antimony (No. 108, January 19 [<hi rend="italic">20</hi>], 11 p.m). Russians are not obtaining the mineral
                        for transportation overland. Limited transport facilities preclude such an
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>No information has reached Embassy indicating that the Japanese are acquiring
                        the mineral from unoccupied China. Chairman [of] Resources Commission states
                        that location of mines well within Free China facilitates control, that he
                        has received no reports of smuggling, and that he is convinced that, if
                        Japanese are obtaining antimony from Hunan, quantities are negligible.</p>

                    <p>171. Embassy has gone thoroughly into the matter of obtaining additional
                        materials for air transport in China (Department’s 83, January 18, 5
                        p.m.).</p>
                    <p>Wood oil is not available at points of air shipment and shortage of internal
                        transport facilities precludes shipment in any quantity from concentration
                        points (largely in Hunan and Szechuan) to airfields in vicinity of Kunming.
                        Disinterested but fully informed Chinese advises against endeavoring to ship
                        wood oil under present conditions stating that, in addition to internal
                        transport difficulties, presently available facilities for preparing oil for
                        export by air would prove unsatisfactory.</p>
                    <p>Antimony is available in ample quantities for export but here again internal
                        transport is the problem for which there is no present practical solution.
                        Transportation of antimony to Kunming would follow same general route as
                        that used for wolfram. Bottleneck is trucking route from Chinchengkiang in
                        Kwangsi to Kutsing in Yunnan. Chairman, Resources Commission, although
                        desirous of furnishing antimony to us, states that, unfortunately until he
                        can obtain more trucks, any antimony transported would displace wolfram. He
                        has been advised that we do not wish to reduce the amount of wolfram now
                        being transported.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy knows of no other usable materials readily available for
                        transport by plane. The quantity of tin shipments might be increased to a
                        maximum of a 1000 tons a month and if our present endeavors to obtain more
                        trucks for wolfram are effectual we may be able to raise wolfram shipments
                        closer 1000 tons a month. Hence we might, with the relatively limited
                        quantities of bristles, silk and mercury which are available from time [to
                        time?], be able to achieve something over 2000 tons a month. Until internal
                        transport problem is solved (trucks are available but gasoline and equipment
                        to keep them operating are very scarce) Embassy does not see how we can
                        further materially increase quantity of materials for export by freight
                        planes.</p>

                    <p>179. Reference final paragraph Department’s 79, January 15 [<hi rend="italic">16</hi>], 1 p.m. Embassy has brought informally to the attention of the
                        Minister of Communications<note n="4" xml:id="d581fn4">Tseng Yang-fu.</note>
                        and the chairman, Resources Commission (Minister of Economics)<note n="5" xml:id="d581fn5">Wong Wen-hao.</note> War Production Board’s desire with
                        regard to priorities in local transport and warehousing, and has received
                        favorable reaction but no action yet. In strict confidence it is feared that
                        highly placed interested Chinese may maneuver utilization of trucks for tea
                        transport that might better be employed carrying tungsten. Transportation
                        route for both is in general the same.</p>
                    <p>Embassy has been unable to obtain any satisfactory estimate of future
                        available plane space for export of materials. Estimates vary from 2 to
                        5,000 tons monthly. It seems clear, however, that in near future priorities
                        on air transport space will cease to be a practical problem and that
                        internal transport to air fields will continue, as it is now, a very real
                        problem (see Embassy’s 171, January 13 [<hi rend="italic">30</hi>], noon)
                        the only apparent solution for this problem is airplane importation of motor
                        gasoline and some equipment so that available trucks can operate to fullest
                        practicable extent.</p>
                    <p>At present military supplies quite reasonably have priority of import space.
                        Some alleviation of internal transport difficulties may come from efforts by
                        new Communications Minister for better coordination of transport.</p>

                    <p>306. Reference Department’s 79, January 15 [<hi rend="italic">16</hi>], 1
                        p.m. Total priority cargo listed 1,170 tons per month including 300 tons of
                        tin for Russia and 200 tons for Metals Reserve. United States Army Air
                        Command has notified the National Resources Commission that the Yangkai air
                        field, which was opened on February 14 with a daily loading capacity of 200
                        tons, would have a daily loading capacity <pb n="650" xml:id="pg_650" facs="0660"/>of 400 tons beginning March 1 while Kunming field would
                        continue operations at previous levels.</p>
                    <p>The National Resources Commission has, at the Embassy’s suggestion, now
                        obtained an order from the Ministry of Communications granting its shipments
                        of strategic materials priority in internal transport over all other goods
                        except military supplies. Commission now hopes to obtain use of a few
                        hundred private trucks now operating over Kwangsi, Kweichow and Yunnan
                        highways but anticipate delays and difficulties. National Resources
                        Commission does not expect to be able to do more than double its present
                        rate of delivery of 1,000 tons per month, leaving a possible 11,000 tons per
                        month unoccupied except in so far as filler cargo in the form of tea and
                        wood oil can be provided at Kunming. The Russians are willing to accept
                        ordinary grade Yunnan tin without further refining and large supplies of
                        such tin are already available at Kunming. Tin of a grade acceptable by
                        Metals Reserve is only available at Kunming in relatively small quantities.
                        As a temporary measure it is recommended that the 300 tons per month limit
                        on tin for Russia be removed and permission given to use Yunnan grade tin
                        for Russia as filler cargo.</p>
                    <p>Internal transport problem reported in my 171, January 30, noon, still
                        blocking delivery at Yangkai of 7,000 tons of wolfram, 3,000 tons of
                        antimony and 6,000 tons of high grade tin now concentrated at Kweilin,
                        Liuchow and Chinchengkiang in northern Kwangsi (all within easy reach of
                        Liuchow air field if air transport from that point later becomes
                        available).</p>
                    <p>As soon as estimates can be obtained of the probable extent of increased
                        deliveries at Yangkai, the Department will be informed.</p>

                        p.m. War Production Board is adjusting priority schedule to 1,500,000 pounds
                        tin for U. S. S. R. at an A–2 priority instead of the 600,000 indicated in
                        the Department’s January 16th. There is furthermore no objection to
                        shipments of Russian owned tin in excess of the new quota should additional
                        quantities become available. The A–2 priority applies to Russian owned tin
                        of all grades.</p>
                    <p>The present quota for Metals Reserve tin 400,000 pounds per month at an A–3
                        rating still stands; but this is not a restrictive quota if more plane space
                        is available and more MRC tin is made available.</p>

                        charges; assume you have copy.</p>
                    <p>I consider this a matter to be settled between Chinese Government departments
                        and have so informed CTC. Also that paying additional U.S. dollars 775 per
                        ton makes cost to us exorbitant and furthermore it is entering wedge for
                        continual requests for increased charges and I believe Chinese request was
                        made as result of increase granted on tea and bristles; further any amount
                        paid in U. S. dollars is not helping their currency problem.</p>
                    <p>I have suggested to CTC that if it costs them CN dollars 15 million monthly
                        for fuel from a semi Government agency to transport above tonnage they
                        arrange for CN dollars to be paid direct to them by Ministry of Finance as
                        subsidy if necessary. Minister of Economics stated that while Ministry of
                        Finance had repeatedly refused to advance enough CN to meet requirements,
                        they have advanced some extra currency.</p>
                    <p>Expect discuss with NRC officials along same line. Do you agree? Also would

                        green tea to fill space otherwise empty. It may be, however, that a minimum
                        quantity of green tea for North Africa will be given a definite priority
                        along with tungsten after the quantities of tungsten urgently required have
                        moved. This subject is now under consideration here and we will advise you
                        of any decision that is reached.</p>
                    <p>With reference to tungsten, it may be stated that the average cost Chinese
                        wolfram delivered comes to about $27 per unit as against only $24 per unit
                        for South American wolfram delivered. Furthermore, your comparison with 1937
                        price wolfram is not valid inasmuch as price mentioned by you for 1937 was
                        c. i. f. U. S. A. duty paid, whereas present price is f. o. b. Kunming.</p>
                    <p>Please consult Army authorities in China and advise whether they can make
                        available the 2,000 tons Eastbound cargo required by CTC. Board is willing
                        to consider increase in the total compensation for wolfram deliveries at
                        Kunming, probably through a bonus for transport charges which would depend
                        upon the quantity ore delivered each month. It is also assumed that the more
                        Eastbound cargo made available by the Army the less the Board would have to
                        pay for increased tungsten shipments. It is assumed we may continue to rely
                        upon deliveries 600 tons monthly at the present price, no matter whether any
                        considerable amount Eastbound cargo materializes. Board would greatly
                        appreciate receiving your estimate of the additional quantities of ore that
                        would be delivered at Kunming and the months in which these deliveries could
                        be expected as follows: if a bonus of 20 cents per pound were paid; if a
                        bonus of 35 cents per pound were paid; or if 50 cents a pound were paid.
                        Board desires to maintain base price $22.60 per unit which is f. o. b. price
                        South American ports. After receipt of your reply, the Board will probably
                        arrange to change base point for deliveries from Kunming to a place nearer
                        the mines. Acceptance of actual deliveries at Kunming would, <pb n="653" xml:id="pg_653" facs="0663"/>of course, be continued and the base point
                        would be arbitrarily used for calculation purposes only.</p>
                    <p>If you perceive no objection, Board suggests that you ask the Chinese
                        Government to enforce priorities on inland transport of cargo purchased in
                        accordance with our wishes. This should be irrespective of various
                        negotiations made for different commodities at varying rates for transport.
                        It seems to the Board that, before consideration is given to any bonus for
                        tungsten transportation, an agreement should probably be had from the
                        Chinese Government with respect to such priority policy.</p>

                    <p>752. For Fowler from Rosenthal. Department’s No. 683, May 27, 10 p.m. crossed
                        your No. 779 of May 25, 4 p.m. but answered it in part. Board is of the
                        opinion that the figures given you on competitive prices wolfram from other
                        producing areas are what you need to support your views regarding advance in
                        transportation charges which the Chinese request in order to increase
                        wolfram deliveries. Board is pleased that there is reason to believe that it
                        may be feasible to renegotiate all inland transport deals previously made on
                        various commodities. We intend hereafter to give you entire responsibility
                        for all inland transport negotiations.</p>
                    <p>Commodities which we wish moved on a priority basis are wolfram, tin for
                        India and Russia, mercury for Russia, bristles, silk for Great Britain, and
                        tung oil. Green tea is to be shipped as filler cargo only both for trucks
                        and planes.</p>

                        <item>Wolfram—Our view is that an increase of mine production will be
                            difficult but that we should make every effort within the next few
                            months to move 7,000 tons referred to in the Embassy’s No. 670 of May 8,
                            11 a.m.<note n="12" xml:id="d586fn12">Not printed.</note> Since question
                            of increasing production wolfram is not of primary importance at this
                            juncture, we intend to await advices from Morris<note n="13" xml:id="d586fn13">J. Marshall Morris, metals and minerals
                                representative of the Office of Economic Warfare, en route to

                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>Tin—As tin originates near airports, inland transport problem does not
                            materially concern this material. However, we understand that
                            considerable amounts black tea are going overland by truck to Russia and
                            we wonder whether part of such truck capacity could not with advantage
                            be devoted to direct shipments tin to Russia. Please comment.</item>

                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Bristles—It is obvious that the high rate for transport bristles has
                            made unfortunate precedent and it is hoped you can renegotiate to reduce
                            this cost. However, it is of first importance to move bristles purchased
                            to the airfields and we have already asked you if it is possible to fly
                            bristles from the Luchow airports.</item>

                        <item>British Silk—We are not acquainted with financing this item, but
                            believe you should consider it jointly with the other articles
                            mentioned.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>Tung oil—Rate of $1340 per ton for inland transport wholly nullifies
                            any chance of business at present; for it is not possible to consider
                            tung oil at more than $600 per ton delivered in India. Although
                            important this commodity is not in the same class as materials listed
                            above.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Antimony—It appears likely that India’s future requirements can be
                            found in that country. No air priority has yet been arranged. See
                            Department’s No. 670, May 26, 7 p.m.<note n="14" xml:id="d586fn14">Not

                        <item>Mercury—No special question arises as the quantity is only 80,000
                            pounds per month.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Green Tea—Consensus of opinion is as follows: Although still desirable
                            to ship substantial amounts to North Africa, importance of these
                            shipments to the general program has decreased in view of recent
                            developments in North Africa. Therefore we wish green tea treated as
                            filler cargo only although we do not wish to prohibit its
                            movement.</item>
                    </list>
                    <p>It seems to us desirable that the question of placing inland transport costs
                        upon a reverse Lend-Lease basis, together with the question of the abnormal
                        exchange situation, might be raised at an appropriate time with the Chinese
                        Government. However, no such action should be taken without instructions
                        from Washington. For your information the Department on May 15th handed to
                        Dr. T. V. Soong<note n="15" xml:id="d586fn15">Chinese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> a draft of a re verse Lend-Lease Agreement.<note n="16" xml:id="d586fn16">
                     <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_538">p.
                                538</ref>.</note> We will explore the desirability of suggesting to
                        the Chinese Government, if this agreement is entered into, the placing
                        thereunder of inland transport costs of foregoing and other commodities that
                        may be purchased from time to time. Should, however, the Chinese on their
                        own part bring up with you the matter of reverse Lend-Lease, please report
                        any suggestions made.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious from observations made in the foregoing paragraphs that, unless
                        prices of the various materials originating in China and delivered at Indian
                        ports can be considerably reduced, the Board will find it in its interests
                        to promote production of these materials in other countries where prices are
                        considerably lower. From our standpoint we are offering very high prices in
                        U. S. dollars for all materials <pb n="655" xml:id="pg_655" facs="0665"/>procured from China and we also sustain heavy cost of air freight out of
                        China. Financial arrangements between the various Chinese Government
                        Departments do not of course concern us, but we believe that the Minister of
                            Finance<note n="17" xml:id="d586fn17">H. H. Kung.</note> should be in a
                        position to make such financial arrangements within China as to effect
                        maximum flow materials required by war industry here. American supplies now
                        arriving in China from the United States are delivered free of charge both
                        as to sea and air transport, which fact is representative of our approach to
                        such matters. Corresponding action on the part of China in the matter of
                        inland transport charges would accordingly be quite justified. However, it
                        would be preferable to reserve this argument for possible use in support of
                        a reverse Lend-Lease arrangement as above described.</p>
                    <p>We feel that the Chinese Government will take broad view of this situation
                        and that it should be possible for you at this time to increase flow of
                        wolfram while at the same time you negotiate lower trucking rates on
                        bristles and possibly on green tea. You might find it possible to obtain
                        Army cooperation to increase flow of wolfram perhaps through charter by them
                        of trucks and other facilities.</p>
                    <p>We consider that in connection with movement wolfram, time is an important
                        factor. A very awkward situation would be created if wolfram supplies should
                        fail to arrive promptly and if as a result of Japanese military activities
                        shipments were subsequently interrupted.</p>
                    <p>As requested by you negotiations are now in course to obtain services of a
                        truck maintenance man and a truck operator. [Rosenthal.]</p>

                    <p>1494. Reference your letter July 13.<note n="20" xml:id="d589fn20">Not found
                            in Department files.</note> I am convinced that we cannot expect
                        official rate of exchange to be changed to cover purchase strategic
                        materials or in land transportation charges inasmuch as on August 14, after
                        an hour’s frank and friendly conversation with Minister of Finance, during
                        which he read above letter, he stated that if the official rate should be
                        changed to 40 to 1 he was certain costs and prices would immediately
                        double.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that the only way to avoid payment for strategic materials at
                        increasingly higher prices is to decide definitely that U. S. dollar costs
                        cannot be increased to keep pace with the inflationary Chinese dollar, to
                        inform the Chinese officially to this effect, in future to buy at an air
                        field delivery price in U. S. dollars, and to urge that the Minister of
                        Finance provide a subsidy to Chinese Government agencies handling
                        commodities if required by them to cover increased costs because of Chinese
                        dollar inflation. The above conviction is based on Washington’s official
                        attitude that these costs will not be covered under a reciprocal Lend-Lease
                            agreement<note n="21" xml:id="d589fn21">For correspondence on this
                            subject, see <ref target="#pg_515">pp. 515</ref> ff.</note> if and when
                        made. In all my conversations with Chinese officials during the past three
                            <pb n="657" xml:id="pg_657" facs="0667"/>months I have urged that the
                        foregoing be done and will continue to do so but if objective is to be
                        obtained pressure from your end must also be applied.</p>
                    <p>If the suggestion had been followed that we make a supplemental contract with
                        NRC to pay a transportation bonus of from 35 cents to 70 cents per pound, as
                        contained in Embassy’s telegram No. 670 of May 8<note n="22" xml:id="d589fn22">Not printed.</note> and which would have been payable
                        at 20 to 1, we would have been expected to increase that bonus just as we
                        are now being asked to do for bristles so as to meet increased inflationary
                        costs. That suggestion was opposed by us, but, as I have already reported to
                        you, tungsten kept moving, probably under a subsidy.</p>
                    <p>In order to meet deficits caused by inflationary increases in costs and
                        transportation charges, the Minister of Finance on August 14, so I am
                        reliably informed, allotted a further sum of CN 120,000,000 as a subsidy for
                        the Ministry of Economics and NRC.</p>
                    <p>So as to pay for upkeep of highways at inflationary wages, there is included
                        in the truck freight rate of CN 35.70 per ton kilometer a highway tax of CN
                        12. The American Army is paying all these charges for its eastbound tonnage,
                        which it states will increase monthly to from 2 to 3000 tons, at a rate of
                        20 to 1. Therefore we are in effect paying inflationary costs and China is
                        not making any contribution toward supplying for the war effort these badly
                        needed materials to the United Nations or war supplies to her own front
                        lines.</p>

                        cannot lose if we pay them one United States dollar per each on 20 of their
                        increasing inflationary cost of materials and transport charges; they have a
                        certain sum to operate on and are not expected to lose money nor make money.
                        In respect to transport charges this was agreed to, thus making it more
                        difficult, under the terms of that agreement, to urge a subsidy for cargo
                        covered therein. On August 16 we conferred with Fooshing and showed them a
                        copy of your July 13 letter which they had not yet received. They promised
                        to recheck cost and for this year’s cargo to quote lower if possible. They
                        also promised, in regard to transport costs, to confer with Government
                        officials although they were not optimistic of accomplishing much if
                        anything. They are powerless themselves to do anything although they agree

                    <p>1520. Embassy’s 1194 [<hi rend="italic">1494</hi>], August 17, (OEW’s 35).
                        Mr. Fowler has asked us to express an opinion in this matter.</p>
                    <p>We do not favor the bringing of pressure upon the Ministry of Finance to
                        provide subsidies to Government agencies which handle the commodities and we
                        concur in the view of OEW (Department’s 752, June 14) that we should not be
                        concerned with the Chinese Government’s interdepartmental financial
                        arrangements.</p>
                    <p>We also concur in the view of OEW, as we understand it, that endeavor should
                        be made to arrange for purchase of strategic materials at fixed prices in
                        United States dollars independent of Chinese exchange fluctuations for
                        delivery at specified air fields. As presumably the Chinese Government does
                        not profit from our loss in exchange under the present arrangement we
                        believe that it is correct to say that no actual financial loss to the
                        Chinese Government would be involved if it accepted payment in United States
                        dollars credited to its account in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The entire problem seems to resolve itself into the question of how badly we
                        need the materials or need to keep them from the enemy, and consequently the
                        question of how much we are willing to pay for them. If as indicated in
                        Department’s 1092, August 12,<note n="24" xml:id="d590fn24">Not
                            printed.</note> we are in position to set a limit upon what we consider
                        desirable to pay in terms of U. S. dollars, and if we inform the Chinese
                        that we will not pay more it is not unlikely that direct pressure upon the
                        Chinese Government would not be required to cause the Chinese Government to
                        make more or less suitable interdepartmental financial arrangements to
                        ensure the procurement transportation, et cetera of the materials. The
                        Chinese Government would probably feel that cessation of the purchases would
                        involve so much loss of face on its part (that is, China might appear to the
                        world as having failed to do its share in connection with one aspect of the
                        war effort in which China is capable of doing its share) that the Chinese
                        Government would feel it necessary to take steps to avoid such ill
                        appearance.</p>

                        The present strong interest on the part of the United States in the supply
                        of tung oil, feathers and hog bristles should be pointed out in this
                        connection. It is feared that these commodities cannot be moved to Kunming
                        in substantial volume by truck but information available here indicates that
                        Suifu would be more accessible.</p>

                    <p>82. Bond of China National Aviation Corporation is urgently requesting
                        consignment of five passenger transport planes for use in maintaining
                        communications with northwest China and between China and India.</p>
                    <p>Corporation now has only three passenger planes with which it endeavors, with
                        highly commendable efficiency, to maintain three flights a week between
                        Chungking and Calcutta via Kunming, biweekly flights to Lanchow. Flights
                        every week or so to Kweilin. Bond is convinced, and states that the Minister
                        of Communications supports his claim, that additional planes are required to
                        permit a minimum of essential official travel which the situation in China
                        now demands. With additional planes requested he would increase the
                        frequency of service to Kunming and Calcutta, would establish a weekly
                        service to Lanchow and Tihua and would have more frequent flights to Chengtu
                        and Kweilin and possibly other centers in Free China. He is also looking
                        into the future when, as Japanese forces are pushed eastward from Central
                        China, it will be necessary to establish air transport to newly recovered
                        centers.</p>
                    <p>We believe that Bond’s request is deserving of early and favorable action.
                        There is no doubt that present passenger transport facilities are most
                        inadequate to serve the essential needs in China; furthermore an extension
                        of air transport service would go far towards fostering a greater degree of
                        political unity in the country. A service to Tihua, for instance, would no
                        doubt contribute materially towards the Generalissimo’s<note n="2" xml:id="d595fn2">Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese Executive
                            Yuan (Premier).</note> plan to draw Sinkiang, and the Northwest as a
                        whole, closer to the Central authority. If it is not practicable to supply
                        the five planes which Bond is requesting we urge that favorable
                        consideration <pb n="662" xml:id="pg_662" facs="0672"/>be given to supplying
                        C.N.A.C. with an additional minimum three planes absolutely essential to
                        meet present needs.</p>

                    <p>282. Reference my 82, January 16, 10 a.m. The C.N.A.C. has lost the use of
                        one of its three passenger planes as a result of a forced landing in the
                        Yangtze River recently. Service to Calcutta is reduced to two flights a week
                        and internal service is proportionately curtailed. Another of the planes is
                        temporarily out of commission awaiting replacement of worn out motors.</p>
                    <p>We re-emphasize the considerations put forward in our reference telegram and
                        urge that prompt action be taken to supply planes to C.N.A.C.</p>

                        yesterday, I asked Soong regarding the accuracy of reports that C.N.A.C. was
                        going to be absorbed by the U.S. Army into the U.S. armed forces in China.
                        Soong replied very definitely that C.N.A.C. was not going to be thus
                        absorbed; he mentioned and emphasized the fact that C.N.A.C. is a Chinese
                        organization. [The Chinese Government owns 55 (or 51) percent of the stock
                        and American interests (Pan American A.A.) owns 45 (or 49) percent.]<note n="3a" xml:id="d598fn5">Brackets appear in the original.</note> I then
                        inquired about the question of the five additional planes. Dr. Soong replied
                        that he understood that four were going to be granted. He mentioned that
                        more had been asked for.</p>
                    <p>C.N.A.C., operating under direction of American administrative personnel, has
                        a superb record in China. You are familiar with parts of that record.
                        Incidentally, C.N.A.C. pioneered in demonstration of the practicability of
                        flying freight between Assam and China. There are indications that the U.S.
                        Army has tried hard to absorb C.N.A.C. In my presence, yesterday, statement
                        was made by a high officer of the U.S. Army Ferry Command that the Army had
                        taken, in China, three of C.N.A.C.’s planes. It has been authoritatively

                        agreement, is seeking to starve C.N.A.C. out of existence.</p>
                    <p>However that may be, and whatever lies behind and under the apparent
                        rejection hitherto of proposals for giving C.N.A.C. additional planes,
                        C.N.A.C. should, in my opinion, be kept alive and be given additional
                        planes, not only four planes but a good many more than four planes: this,
                        for political reasons, for economic reasons and even for military reasons.
                        Man for man and plane for plane, I would wager that C.N.A.C. will
                        continuously equal or top the best work of the Army (which is rapidly
                        improving) in carrying freight between Assam and China. Moreover, the
                        Chinese should have some air service at their own command, independently of
                        the U.S. Army and without the necessity of applying to the Army every time
                        they want to send a pound of freight or a passenger. And, there being only
                        one channel of communication between this country and China, the Army ought
                        not have a complete monopoly of that channel: it is good for the Army and
                        for all concerned for the Army to have some competition.</p>

                            British Prime Minister.</note> it is stated that the President and Mr.
                        Churchill had been in communication with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and
                        that they had apprized him of the measures which they were undertaking to

                        cause. Accounts in the press relating to the Casablanca conference
                        emphasized <hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi> that it had been decided to
                        render all possible aid to China.</p>

                        operations against Japan.</p>
                    <p>On February 12 in his address to the White House Correspondents’

                            145.</note> President Roosevelt, in referring to the Pacific theater of
                        war, stated that “Great and decisive actions against the Japanese will be
                        taken to drive the invader from the soil of China. Important actions will be
                        taken in the skies over China—and over Japan itself. The discussions at
                        Casablanca have been continued in Chungking with the Generalissimo by
                        General Arnold and have resulted in definite plans for offensive
                        operations.”</p>
                    <p>The presence of Madame Chiang Kai-shek in Washington has given additional
                        significance and weight to the statements of the President.</p>
                    <p>Press accounts of the joint press conference held by the President and Madame
                        Chiang Kai-shek on February 19 reported that the President stressed the
                        difficulties involved in getting substantial aid to China and emphasized his
                        intention to accelerate the sending of such aid.</p>
                    <pb n="665" xml:id="pg_665" facs="0675"/>
                    <p>On February 26 the American Ambassador at Chungking telegraphed that the
                        China National Aviation Corporation had, as the result of a forced landing
                        recently in the Yangtze River, lost the use of one of its three passenger
                        planes; that due to the necessity of awaiting replacement of worn-out
                        motors, one of the China National Aviation Corporation planes cannot be
                        operated for the time being; and that service within China has had to be
                        curtailed and the service from China to Calcutta has had to be reduced to
                        two flights a week. The Ambassador urges again the importance of prompt
                        action being taken to furnish the China National Aviation Corporation with
                        additional planes.</p>
                    <p>Copies in paraphrase of the telegram of February 26 and of a telegram of
                        January 16 from the American Ambassador at Chungking are enclosed. The
                        Department forwarded a copy in paraphrase of the telegram of January 16 to
                        the Secretary of War under date January 23 and at the same time expressed
                        its support of the recommendation made therein and requested that the matter
                        be brought to the attention of the Munitions Assignment Committee.</p>
                    <p>This Department is in accord with the views expressed by the American
                        Ambassador at Chungking.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes that the prompt supplying to the China National
                        Aviation Corporation of additional planes would not only be in conformity
                        with the situation as described by the American Ambassador to China but also
                        with the broad political-military considerations mentioned in the first part
                        of this letter. The Department therefore earnestly hopes that the Munitions
                        Assignment Board may give this matter renewed and favorable consideration at
                        an early date.</p>

                        was present yesterday at a meeting of the Munitions Assignments Committee
                        (Air) of which Colonel Langmead is chairman, when that Committee considered
                        the renewed request of C.N.A.C. for five transport planes to be used on
                        internal routes in China. General Mao,<note n="11" xml:id="d600fn11">Gen. P.

                    <p>According to Mr. Woodard, the Committee felt that it must regard itself as
                        bound by the terms of a basic directive in the form of a telegram (Mr.
                        Woodard thinks dated about June 1942) from General Marshall<note n="12" xml:id="d600fn12">Gen. George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, United States
                            Army.</note> to General Stilwell in which it is stated that the
                        Munitions Assignments Board will assign all Lend-Lease material destined to
                        China subject to the disposition of General Stilwell. Because of the terms
                        of this directive, which the Committee felt it has no authority to review,
                        the Committee refused to recommend the immediate allocation to C.N.A.C. of
                        five planes and it further refused to recommend that five of those planes
                        which under a previous allocation are currently being forwarded to C.N.A.C.
                        at the rate of two a month be especially earmarked for use in China. (It
                        will be recalled that C.N.A.C. was required—according to the C.D.S.<note n="13" xml:id="d600fn13">China Defense Supplies, Incorporated.</note>
                        version of the matter—to enter into a contract with General Stilwell whereby
                        all planes received by C.N.A.C. under regular Lend-Lease allocations must be
                        utilized by C.N.A.C. solely on the Assam-China rim under Army
                        direction.)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Woodard said that according to statements made at the meeting a prior
                        Lend-Lease allocation to C.N.A.C. provided for a total of 25 transport
                        planes to be supplied to C.N.A.C. Of these 25 a total of 19 are now in
                        operation on the Assam-China run. Under the terms of this allocation two
                        additional planes a month are scheduled to be sent forward to India for
                        C.N.A.C. The Committee referred to another standing policy directive which
                        is to replace losses of previously allocated planes. Acting under this
                        directive the Committee agreed to recommend that the present schedule of two
                        additional planes a month for C.N.A.C. be continued throughout 1943 on the
                        theory that it was to be presumed that losses would warrant such a
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Woodard assumed that it was the hope of the Committee that under the last
                        mentioned decision it should be possible for the Chinese Government or for
                        C.N.A.C. to arrange with General Stilwell for the release from the contract
                        of five planes at some time in the course of the current year. Mr. Woodard
                        is not informed as to whether this decision is regarded by C.D.S. as
                        satisfactory.</p>

                    <p>383. Reorganization of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation into the Central Air
                        Transport Corporation has been announced subject to <pb n="667" xml:id="pg_667" facs="0677"/>the approval of the Executive Yuan. New
                        corporation is capitalized at 20,000,000 Chinese dollars and will be under
                        the Ministry of Communications. Following the break in relations between
                        China and Germany in July 1941, German interests in Eurasia were frozen and
                        operation since then has been entirely in Chinese hands. The corporation
                        [is] operating but one old plane, but a press notice expresses the
                        expectation that a number of new airplanes will be added so as to make
                        possible an extension of service. The present plane operates in interior
                        China on irregular schedule out of Chungking south to Kweilin and northwest
                        to Sinkiang.</p>

                        planes—for use in China’s internal transportation. The Foreign Office had
                        instructed the Embassy to the effect that Great Britain had no transport
                        planes to spare with the exception of perhaps a half dozen “old planes”;
                        that the British Government was party to a commitment whereby the China
                        theater is an area to be supplied by the United States; that General
                        Stilwell did not want to have these old planes sent in because he would have
                        to supply them with gas and maintenance; and that the British Government is
                        informing the Chinese Government that it is not in position to meet the
                        Chinese Government’s request. Further, the Foreign Office instructed the
                        Embassy to inform us of the above.</p>
                    <p>I thanked Sir George for his imparting of this information and I asked
                        whether I might inquire just why his Government was bringing this to this
                        Department’s attention. Sir George replied that he would assume, and he
                        would assume that his Government would assume, that the matter would be of
                        interest to this Department. I then asked whether the commitment to which
                        Sir George had referred provided that the furnishing of supplies to China
                        was to be exclusively a function of the United States. Sir George replied
                        that he did not know but that he would infer that such was the case. I then
                        asked whether this would mean that Russia also was excluded. Sir George
                        replied that he did not know. I then asked whether there is any area which
                        is exclusively to be supplied by <pb n="668" xml:id="pg_668" facs="0678"/>Great Britain. Sir George replied that he did not know but he would assume
                        that there was. Sir George then added that, as he understood it, all
                        allocations of war supplies were to be made by a Board which sits in
                        Washington. I then asked whether the British Government would consider
                        itself bound in the light of that fact to refrain from supplying any country
                        with any transport planes independently of and without reference to
                        procedures and decisions of that Board. Sir George smiled—as each of us had
                        done at earlier points in the conversation—and replied that he did not know.
                        I then said that I hoped that, in informing the Chinese Government that they
                        were unable to comply with the Chinese Government’s request for any
                        transport planes, the British Government did not say to the Chinese that
                        they were unable to comply with the request because they had promised the
                        United States that they would not do such things without permission and the
                        American Government or an agent or agents thereof would not give permission.
                        Sir George again smiled. This marked the end of the official chapter of this
                        conversation.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Berle</hi>: Reference is made to your letter
                        of March 2, 1943, in which you requested reconsideration by the Munitions
                        Assignments Board of action of February 3, 1943 in disapproving the request
                        made by China for the assignment of an additional five Douglas C–47
                        transport airplanes to the China National Aviation Corporation. As I
                        understand it, these additional airplanes are desired for service between
                        points within China, and are not intended for use on the Air Ferry Route
                        from India to China.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese requirement for five additional C–47 airplanes has been reviewed,
                        and I regret to inform you, that it has been found necessary to adhere to
                        the original decision. There is an acute shortage of this type of aircraft
                        in all theaters of operation and the available supply must be distributed
                        equitably. Consideration of all the factors involved indicates that China
                        has been relatively as well provided for as any other theater of
                        operations.</p>
                    <p>The Munitions Assignments Board assigns two C–47 airplanes each month to
                        China for the China National Aviation Corporation. These assignments will,
                        by April 1943, achieve the original objective of 25 airplanes which was set
                        up for that company. Assignment of two <pb n="669" xml:id="pg_669" facs="0679"/>C–47 airplanes per month from April through June, as now
                        tentatively planned, will provide one airplane to replace anticipated crash
                        losses, and five additional airplanes which should raise the total in the
                        hands of the China National Aviation Corporation to about 30 airplanes by
                        the end of July 1943.</p>
                    <p>Whether the China National Aviation Corporation can use these airplanes on
                        air routes located entirely within China, is a matter which must be
                        determined by other agencies. It is my understanding that General Stilwell
                        some months ago reached an agreement with China National Aviation
                        Corporation for the operation of all or a portion of its airplanes on the
                        Ferry Route between India and China. The details of this contract and the
                        restrictions which it may impose upon the freedom of action of the China
                        National Aviation Corporation in utilizing airplanes on air routes lying
                        entirely within China are unknown to the Munitions Assignments Board. I
                        think we must assume that if General Stilwell’s agreement results in undue
                        restrictions upon the China National Aviation Corporation, the General will
                        modify this contract if such action will best serve the common interest.</p>
                    <p>Action is now being taken to strengthen the Air Ferry route between China and
                        India. From the Casablanca Conference, General Arnold proceeded to Kunming
                        where on February 7, 1943, he made certain commitments to Generalissimo
                        Chiang Kai-shek involving the provision of additional transport airplanes
                        for the Chinese theater. These commitments were based upon a full
                        appreciation of the need for air transportation in the Chinese theater, as
                        compared with the needs in other theaters. General Arnold’s commitments did
                        not, as I understand it, visualize any transport airplanes for use
                        exclusively within the border of China. It was General Arnold’s impression
                        that the Generalissimo accepted these commitments as satisfactory. Since
                        returning from Kunming, General Arnold has taken further steps to increase
                        the tonnage which can be hauled into China by air transportation. This is to
                        be accomplished by the prompt dispatch to the Chinese theater of a number of
                        our largest two-engined transports, the Curtiss C–46.</p>
                    <p>I regret that it has been necessary to again disapprove the request of the
                        Chinese for additional transport airplanes.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                            consideration to this request feels that because all Lend-Lease material

                            Stilwell, it cannot recommend the allocation of planes specifically for
                            the interior air service desired by CNAC. However, the Board has
                            approved the recommendation of the Munitions Assignments Committee (air)
                            that the present scheduled allotment of two planes a month to CNAC be
                            continued throughout 1943.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Therefore in all probability CNAC will receive planes throughout 1943
                            at the rate of two per month but it appears under existing policy
                            directives regarding Lend-Lease supplies that the Munitions Assignments
                            Board feels it can only allocate planes to CNAC subject to the
                            disposition of General Stilwell. Furthermore, it is reported here that
                            under the terms of a contract between CNAC and General Stilwell all
                            planes allocated by Lend-Lease must be utilized solely on the
                            Assam-China run under Army direction. Is this correct?</item>

                    <p>Reference is made to Mr. Hornbeck’s memorandum of March 25 concerning
                        information imparted to him by Sir George Sansom with respect to a request
                        by the Chinese to the British Government for transport planes.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray said that Mr. Hornbeck had recently raised the question as to whether
                        there are arrangements by which the British Government has agreed that it
                        will not supply military equipment to China without the consent of the
                        United States Government.</p>
                    <pb n="671" xml:id="pg_671" facs="0681"/>
                    <p>Mr. Ray said that he had made inquiry among responsible officials of the
                        Munitions Assignments Board and that he had been informed that there is an
                        arrangement between the United States and Great Britain whereby all Chinese
                        requests made to the British Government for military supplies are referred
                        to the Munitions Assignments Board accompanied by a statement as to whether
                        the British are in position to supply the requested materials and a
                        recommendation by the British Government as to the disposition to be made of
                        the request. Under this arrangement it is understood that final action on
                        such requests is to be taken by the Munitions Assignments Board.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray went on to say that he had been informed that Mr. Eden<note n="15" xml:id="d605fn15">Anthony Eden, British Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Aflairs.</note> brought over with him the request which the Chinese had
                        made for transport planes and that this request had been turned down by the
                        Munitions Assignments Board with General Marshall’s concurrence.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray said that he had been informed that there was no formal agreement
                        concerning the above arrangement but that he had been assured that the
                        arrangement is in effect and that under it the decision of the Munitions
                        Assignments Board is final. In this connection he said that he was also
                        informed that under the arrangement the Munitions Assignments Board may
                        initiate procurement of supplies for China in England. In answer to his
                        question as to whether any such cases had occurred he was told that his
                        informant did not recall any.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray said that apparently the information which he had received was not
                        regarded as confidential but he said that since he had no responsibility in
                        this province but had merely obtained information which he believed to be
                        accurate he preferred that the information not be attributed to him in any
                        use which the Department might make of it.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ray further said that he has been informed by China Defense Supplies that
                        the next step which the Chinese plan to take with respect to their desire to
                        obtain transport planes from the United States is to have Dr. T. V. Soong
                        call upon General Marshall and ask General Marshall if he will inform
                        General Stilwell that it is the right and privilege of the Chinese
                        Government to use as that Government deems best, equipment which is
                        allocated to them by the United States Government. Mr. Ray said that C. D.
                        S. means to distinguish between equipment definitely assigned to Stilwell
                        for operations under his direction and equipment which is asked for by the
                        Chinese Government for other uses than the operations being conducted under
                        General Stilwell.</p>

                                <p>Chinese Government accepts Lend-Lease planes in Florida whereupon
                                    they pass from American to Chinese control, being then handed
                                    over to CNAC to fly to China. The planes are then under the
                                    control of the Generalissimo and are not in Stilwell’s
                                    jurisdiction. Two planes monthly beginning June and ending
                                    December have been allocated by Munitions Assignment[s] Board
                                    for use in interior of China. As already advised one of these
                                    planes is being sent in advance. War Department is not
                                    communicating with Stilwell inasmuch as use of these planes is
                                    for Chinese determination. Discussion of the matter with
                                    Stilwell or War Department not necessary. Does Army contract
                                    require that all Lend-Lease planes turned over by Chinese
                                    Government to CNAC at West Palm Beach be used on the Assam-China
                                    run? There should be no such provision although there may be one
                                    for the first 25 planes. Advise. Action in the matter by Bond
                                    should be under the Generalissimo and not under the American
                                    Army. Careful handling is required.</p>

                    <p>607. Bond tells me that he has been approached with proposal that CNAC make
                        available a number of its pilots to “check out” (training given co-pilots
                        until they are familiar with routes and flying and landing conditions) new
                        pilots for RAF<note n="18" xml:id="d607fn18">Royal Air Force.</note> planes
                        to be operated out of Chungking, Kweilin and Lanchow. He understands that
                        transport planes will be used and surmises that British plan to make up for
                        deficiency of CNAC planes on interior Chinese routes. He has been told
                        however that reason behind contemplated RAF operation is probably
                        political.</p>
                    <p>Bond is leaving in few days for Washington. With reference to Department’s
                        422, March 30, midnight, he says that CNAC has prospect of receiving a few
                        additional planes for its passenger service.</p>

                    <p>You may recall the request made by the Chinese Government in February 1943
                        for five Lend-Lease transport planes to be used for maintaining official
                        communications within China and to supplement the existing CNAC service from
                        Chungking to Calcutta. This request was strongly endorsed by the Ambassador
                        and by the Department in a memorandum submitted to the Munitions Assignments
                        Committee for Air, to which the request was referred.</p>
                    <p>At the time this request was made, there were being delivered to China two
                        transport planes per month, but all these planes were being assigned to
                        freight operations between Assam, India and the Kunming area, under the
                        terms of a contract between CNAC and the United States Army. It was
                        apparently because of this limitation on the use of the planes then being
                        delivered to China, that the new and separate request for five additional
                        planes was submitted by the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>The MAC (Air) rejected this request, but recommended the extension of a
                        previous assignment of Lend-Lease transport planes for China, which was due
                        to be completed in May 1943, for the balance of the year, at the rate of two
                        planes per month. The Munitions Assignments Board approved this
                        recommendation, and the planes in question have been regularly assigned at
                        the indicated rate to date.</p>
                    <p>When this last assignment was made, it was not clear whether the planes in
                        question could be applied to fill the need for which the specific Chinese
                        request mentioned above had been submitted. You may recall that, to try to
                        clear up this question, I called on General Burns<note n="19" xml:id="d609fn19">Maj. Gen. J. H. Burns, Executive Officer of Munitions
                            Assignments Board, United States and Great Britain.</note> and on an Air
                        Force officer of the Munitions Assignments Board staff. We were informed
                        that the Munitions Assignments Board considered the disposition within a
                        theatre of aircraft assigned to that theatre to be beyond the functions of
                        the Board. This problem was felt to be entirely within the province of the
                        Commanding General of the theatre in consultation with the appropriate
                        Allied Government.</p>
                    <p>This statement left considerable uncertainty in our minds, but it was felt at
                        the time by China Defense Supplies that the problem was one which could only
                        be worked out within the theatre. I believe there was an informal suggestion
                        that, in view of the Department’s original <pb n="675" xml:id="pg_675" facs="0685"/>endorsement of the Chinese request for the desired five
                        planes, the American Embassy at Chungking might be willing to participate in
                        negotiations on the problem between Chinese authorities and the Commanding
                        General’s Headquarters.</p>
                    <p>In view of the background, you may be interested in the further developments
                        set forth in the attached copy of a memorandum<note n="20" xml:id="d609fn20">Not printed.</note> prepared by William S. Youngman, Jr., President of
                        China Defense Supplies, Inc., for Col. T. S. Timberman, Chief, Asiatic
                        Theatre, Operations Division, War Department General Staff.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the problem with me Col. Timberman spoke rather strongly of the
                        War Department’s objections to the expansion of non-military air transport
                        service within China as constituting a severe drain (for fuel and repair
                        parts) on the limited air space available for transport into China. He also
                        questioned the legitimacy of the use to which it was felt these planes would
                        be put. He said there had been criticism from Chinese sources of General
                        Stilwell for keeping at his Headquarters a plane for emergency staff use,
                        while he opposed even the replacement of CNAC losses. I gathered that
                        feelings were running rather high between the Theatre Command and the
                        Chinese authorities concerned in this problem. Dr. T. V. Soong is currently
                        away from Washington and Col. Timberman’s orders were apparently to deal
                        only directly with him, so the matter will not be pressed further until Dr.
                        Soong’s return.</p>
                    <p>Youngman’s memorandum, attached hereto is rather weak at several points,
                        though the solution he suggests, I feel, is a common sense one. Needless to
                        say, the action taken by China Defense Supplies, purportedly on the
                        authority of the Generalissimo, in assigning the plane No. 42–32787 to
                        replace the lost CNAC plane was considered by Stilwell’s Headquarters and by
                        the War Department as a clear violation of the earlier contract between the
                        U.S. Army and CNAC as to the use of Lend-Lease planes delivered to China.
                        Youngman’s claim that this earlier contractual arrangement, dating from
                        about October 1, 1942, left Chinese authorities in the United States under
                        the impression that the Generalissimo had the right to decide into what war
                        service the Lend-Lease planes being delivered to China should go, is highly
                        questionable, from my personal familiarity with the negotiations leading to
                        the contract in question. I had several discussions on the subject with Mr.
                        Bond of CNAC, and with Lt. Col. McHugh of the Embassy, both of whom felt
                        that the contract being negotiated by General Clayton Bissell was so severe
                        as to promise future trouble.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the plea that this contract, or the later one apparently
                        signed February 17, 1943, was an <hi rend="italic">ultra vires</hi> act on
                        the part of CNAC is, in my humble opinion, disingenuous. I strongly believe
                            <pb n="676" xml:id="pg_676" facs="0686"/>that the Chinese authorities in
                        Chungking knew what they were doing and are now simply trying to back out of
                        a bad bargain they should never have made.</p>
                    <p>Incidentally, I have been informally advised by both the War Department and
                        China Defense Supplies that General Arnold recently ordered out to China
                        five other transport planes to be turned over to the Chinese Air Force. I do
                        not have written confirmation of this as yet, but I am assured that the
                        planes have been dispatched from this country. This extra assignment is
                        entirely separate from the CNAC operations under the contract with the U.S.
                        Army and from CNAC’s regular services into and within China. But these five
                        planes obviously constitute another drain on the aviation gasoline and
                        maintenance parts which must be flown in over the hump, and lend some point
                        to the War Department’s objections to the expansion of the CNAC fleet.</p>
                    <p>I should be glad to discuss this problem with you further when you have had
                        an opportunity to think it over. My own first thought on the matter is that
                        little can be done from this end and that a real meeting of the minds out in
                        Chungking is highly desirable to eliminate this source of friction between
                        the Chinese and our military authorities.</p>

                        with CNAC’s endeavors to obtain 5 transport planes for interior
                        communication have recently occurred as follows: <list>

                            <item>On June 18 General Mow telegraphed from Washington to Aviation

                                telegraphed this info to Commanding General ATC and suggested latter
                                issue orders that the planes be turned over to CNAC. No reply to

                            <item>CNAC received official notice August 2 that the 5 planes were, by
                                order of the Gmo,<note n="22" xml:id="d610fn22">Generalissimo Chiang

               </p>
                    <p>2. CNAC now has only these [<hi rend="italic">three?</hi>] planes for
                        maintenance ordinary communication week [<hi rend="italic">with?</hi>] India
                        and interior communication in unoccupied China. According to informant, CNAC
                        expected that the 5 planes allotted for such communications would [be]
                        turned over to CNAC to operate, and CNAC’s endeavors to obtain these planes,
                        together with its contribution to the war effort and its reputation,
                        probably had much to do with the making of the allocation.</p>
                    <p>3. Persons conversant with the situation state that Aviation Commission now
                        operates 2 planes on interior routes but does not have enough qualified
                        pilots for 5 more, and that despite gas shortage Commission is feverishly
                        training pilots for these planes. It is doubtful whether it can operate them
                        to capacity or to produce the benefit to the war effort which could be
                        derived from operation by CNAC, not to mention greater risk of loss by
                        accident.</p>
                    <p>Also, there is reported possibility of turning over some of new planes to
                        Central Aircraft Transport Co., formerly Eurasia, which now operates only
                        one old German plane. Latter have long cultivated influential friends by
                        methods assertedly not used by CNAC and also have some strength because
                        wholly Chinese while CNAC is Sino-foreign. (Former German connection is
                        allegedly entirely ended.)</p>
                    <p>Apart from fact that CNAC could employ these planes much more effectively
                        than CATC in the war effort, there would seem also to have arisen the
                        question of the undesirability of having Lend-Lease planes used by Chinese
                        interests to compete with established American interests.</p>

                    <p>1137. Your 1410, August 9, 1 p.m. We acquainted Bond with development
                        mentioned leading to the recent delivery to the Aviation Commission of five
                        transports, but we did not indicate that we or the Embassy thought that
                        there was anything amiss in this disposition made of the transports. Bond
                        was already aware in general of these developments, and also did not appear
                        to think that the delivery to the Commission violated in any way CNAC’s
                        rights. So <pb n="678" xml:id="pg_678" facs="0688"/>far as the Department
                        and Bond have been able to learn, the transports are to be used solely for
                        military and official communications in the interior. Bond believes that
                        China has sufficient pilots to operate the five planes. A detailed

                    <p>Of all the efforts to develop aviation in China, American enterprise has been
                        the most successful. The pioneer and sole representative of this enterprise
                        has been the Pan American Airways System, since 1930 operating in China as
                        the China National Aviation Corporation, an organization in which the
                        Chinese Ministry of Communications owns 55% of the stock and Panair 45%. By
                        its policies, its superb management and operations, its tact and its devoted
                        service in the face of danger, war and loss of air routes, CNAC has made an
                        outstanding contribution to the Chinese war effort and to Sino-American
                        relations. Moreover, the direct service which CNAC had rendered to the
                        United States military operations and to United States commercial interests
                        in China has been of extraordinary value.</p>
                    <p>As a result of the mobilization for war purposes of the American aviation
                        industry, CNAC has been unable in the past few years to keep up its fleet
                        and at present has only two DC–3 and one Lend-Lease C–47 transports with
                        which to operate its services from Kunming to Calcutta and within unoccupied
                        China. CNAC, in addition, has some 30 Lend-Lease transports assigned to it
                        by the United States Army, but under the terms of its contract with the Army
                        these transports may only be used for freight operations between Assam,
                        India, and the Kunming area (“over the hump”), so that this service does not
                        facilitate CNAC’s transport operations within unoccupied China.</p>

                        the Central Aviation Transport Company (the successor of the German Eurasia

                            commercial aviation in China. In fact, however, this company’s
                            transports only shuttle back and forth between Alma-Ata and Hami, in
                            Russian and Chinese Turkestan, respectively, and are not of much service
                            to China proper. [Footnote in the original.]</note> CATC’s fleet
                        consists of one 10–year-old Junker 52, and this machine plus the three
                        aforesaid CNAC planes now make up China’s entire commercial air fleet for
                        internal communications and for communications with the outside (India).</p>
                    <p>The CNAC-Army contract, mentioned above, signed on February 17, 1943,
                        provided that all Lend-Lease air transports belonging to the Chinese
                        Government and then allocated to or being operated by the carrier (CNAC) as
                        well as “all Lend-Lease transports which may in the future be allocated by
                        the United States to the Government of China” would be operated by the
                        carrier for “over the hump” transport. Because of this limitation on the use
                        of Lend-Lease planes for China, the Chinese Government in February 1943 made
                        a separate request that five transports be allocated to it for maintaining
                        official communications within China and to supplement the existing CNAC
                        service from Chungking to Calcutta. In pursuance of this request five planes
                        were recently delivered to the Aeronautical Commission of the Chinese
                        Government, but, as these machines, according to present information, will
                        be used by the Aeronautical Commission or by CATC, this allocation will not
                        contribute in any way toward promoting or even maintaining an American
                        interest in internal transport in China.</p>
                    <p>CNAC has sought to have released to it for use within China a minimum of five
                        transports from among those Lend-Lease transports assigned to it for “over
                        the hump” service. On January 23, 1943, the Department, in a letter to the
                        War Department, expressed its support of the recommendation of the American
                        Ambassador at Chungking that five such transports be released to CNAC. The
                        Department has received information to the effect that, because of the
                        anticipated demand for fuel and repair parts on the limited air space
                        available for transport into China which this would entail, the United
                        States Army authorities in the theaters involved have been consistently
                        opposed to any expansion of civilian air services within China.</p>
                    <p>From the immediate and strictly strategic point of view, the position taken
                        by the Army authorities in India and China with respect to the expansion at
                        present of commercial air facilities within China has undeniable force.
                        However, there are important reasons for taking a long-range view of the
                        situation and finding a means of improving the interior air communications
                        of China through, as far as <pb n="680" xml:id="pg_680" facs="0690"/>possible, the medium of CNAC, which by reason of its technical experience,
                        facilities, and organization is best equipped to effect such improvement.
                        Among such reasons are the following:</p>
                            <p>(1) The American interests in CNAC have pioneered in the China field
                                and have established an excellent reputation with the Chinese for
                                cooperativeness in administration and effectiveness in operations.
                                They have rendered invaluable services to the Chinese Government,
                                Chinese persons of importance, and foreigners in China. The position
                                which they have established constitutes a political and an economic
                                asset valuable to the United States. It is desirable that this asset
                                be conserved. Toward conserving it, there is need that CNAC be
                                offered the means of maintaining and strengthening itself. If this
                                means is not provided there is danger that this splendid
                                organization will fade out of the picture in China. Were it to fade
                                out, there might fade out with it the favorable position for
                                American aviation in China. It is desirable, for the post-war
                                interest of the American aviation industry as a whole, that that
                                position not be lost. The Chinese are not overlooking and will not
                                fail to note the attitude of the American Government toward an
                                American interest which has performed as has the American management
                                in this (CNAC) enterprise.</p>
                            <p>(2) Service renderable by civil aviation in China is important in
                                    its bearing on the problem of keeping up the Chinese war effort.
                                    Most of the small number of planes other than military which are
                                    operating within China now are employed in transportation of
                                    military personnel (Chinese) and for other purposes decided upon
                                    by that personnel. Such, it is understood, will be primarily the
                                    employment of the five planes recently delivered to the
                                    Aeronautical Commission of the Chinese Government. But there is
                                    need to facilitate transportation of civilian personnel,
                                    including some official civilian personnel, not only Chinese but
                                    also American and other, commercial and industrial personnel
                                    engaged in activities non-military but of importance in
                                    connection with the war effort. There is special need for quick
                                    transportation between Chungking and Kunming, between Kunming
                                    and Kweichow, and between Chungking and Chengtu and points
                                    northwest of Chengtu.</p>
                                <p>As a result of the progressively weakening economic condition of
                                    free China, arising from the isolation of the area, and of the
                                    breakdown of transport within the area to move essential local
                                    cargoes to vital points, there is developing in China a
                                    condition bordering upon a truce with enemy-occupied areas and
                                    with the Japanese forces on the front lines. The United Nations
                                    have been casting about to find means of arresting this trend
                                    and raising the will to fight among the Chinese forces, and
                                    under present conditions it would appear that a few more air
                                    transports offer one means.</p>
                                <pb n="681" xml:id="pg_681" facs="0691"/>
                                <p>Although, it is understood, the Chinese Government is not under
                                    obligation to assign to CNAC any of the planes which may be
                                    allocated to China under Lend-Lease, there is ample reason for
                                    assuming that an arrangement can be made whereunder, if the
                                    United States Army would exempt from the restrictions contained
                                    in its contract with CNAC five transport planes, the five planes
                                    thus exempted would be put at the disposal of CNAC for
                                    employment in the operations within China of CNAC.</p>
                            <p>(3) For over ten years, in the face of the severest sort of trials,
                                CNAC has persevered in its efforts to carry on a program which has
                                been not only of great service to China but has also contributed to
                                the promotion of American interests. At the present moment the
                                Chinese are showing a tendency to do away with any enterprise in
                                their country which in their opinion smacks of foreign “influence.”
                                Disappearance of CNAC as a result of the operation of this tendency
                                and of lack of material American governmental support would create a
                                vacuum in China’s internal commercial air communications. It is
                                conceivable that in those circumstances some European interest might
                                eagerly rush in and be accepted by the Chinese, with a consequent
                                loss to our aviation interests of their ground-floor advantage in
                                China. Moreover, we are going to need every possible “trading”
                                instrumentality for purposes of holding our own in our dealings with
                                China within and during the next few years. For political,
                                diplomatic, and commercial reasons it thus seems to the Department
                                that it is essential that American interests such as those
                                represented by CNAC be given strong United States support within
                                legitimate and appropriate limits.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, the Department strongly recommends that favorable action be
                        taken on the standing request of CNAC for five additional transport
                        planes.</p>

                        Department’s letter of March 2, 1943, in which it was requested that there
                        be reconsidered the action taken by the Munitions Assignments Board on
                        February 3, 1943, disapproving the request made by China Defense Supplies,
                        Incorporated, that five C–47 transport planes be assigned to China for the
                        use of the China National Aviation Corporation and to your letter of March
                        26, 1943, stating that it was necessary again to disapprove the Chinese

                    <p>As you are aware, five Lend-Lease transport planes were recently allocated to
                        China to facilitate military and official communications. We understand that
                        these planes have been turned over to the Aeronautical Commission of the
                        Chinese Government for employment in such communications. This allocation,
                        however, does not meet the standing need of the China National Aviation
                        Corporation for five additional transports for internal communications in
                        China and for communications between China and India. There is enclosed a

                            correct and Chinese intend to keep CATC a purely Chinese concern. He
                            admits, however, that for a year or longer there have been conversations
                            with the British for a joint air service from India to China via Sikang
                            or Sinkiang with a view to obtaining all possible <pb n="683" xml:id="pg_683" facs="0693"/>means of communication and transport
                            with the outside world. The British Ambassador in a further conversation
                            states that CATC has “been after” the British for some time in an effort
                            to interest them in a Sino-British aviation venture and that the
                            British-Chinese Corporation has now come forward. His reputed
                            understanding is that the projected Sino-British company could take over
                            the interior routes formerly flown by Eurasia with a connection in
                            India, assumably Calcutta; but there was no intention to open new routes
                            through Sikang or Sinkiang as, while trial CNAC flights had shown flying
                            could be successful in fair weather, in adverse weather planes could not
                            reach sufficient altitudes to insure crossing the mountains.</item>
                        <label>2.</label>
                        <item>These conversations have been all casual and informal and we are
                            continuing quietly to pursue the matter.</item>

                    <p>The problem of arranging for the allocation of five airplanes to the China
                        National Aviation Corporation was discussed at some length. It was agreed
                        that in view of the fact that the Munitions Assignment[s] Committee (air)
                        had again disapproved the request for these planes and that General Arnold
                        in a recent letter made it plain that there would be no additional planes
                        available to CNAC for a long time, there is little hope of moving the
                        military in this matter. Mr. Walstrom stated that in view of these
                        developments and with the approval of Mr. Berle IN was drafting a memorandum
                        which is to be presented to the President on the general problem of
                        allocation of a few planes for the maintenance of essential civilian air
                        services in various parts of the world. In this connection he mentioned that
                        the situation in South America was very acute. Mr. Stanton inquired whether
                        specific cases would be mentioned including the case of CNAC. Mr. Walstrom
                        replied that in as much as the memorandum had to be limited to one page it
                        would not be possible to mention specific cases. Mr. Stanton suggested that
                        geographical areas, including China, be mentioned. Mr. Walstrom said he
                        thought that the memorandum could be drafted along such lines and that a
                        copy of the draft would be sent to us for our information and comment. He
                        said that the memorandum would suggest to the President that one or two
                        transport planes be allocated each month from the assembly lines in the
                        United States for the specific purpose of meeting this situation which the
                        State Department feels is of real importance. It would be further suggested
                        that the disposition of such planes be placed directly under the control of
                        the State Department rather than our military authorities.</p>
                    <p>There was also some discussion regarding the possibility at this juncture of
                        taking up with the Chinese the question of participation <pb n="685" xml:id="pg_685" facs="0695"/>in a multilateral aviation agreement which
                        would provide for landing rights in Chinese territories and for related
                        matters. It was felt however that until some preliminary and exploratory
                        discussions had been instituted with the British and Russians no useful
                        purpose would be served in approaching the Chinese.</p>

                    <p>2096. Department’s 1458, October 9. Discrepancy between British and Chinese
                        statements (which, of course, was quite clear to us) continues, Chinese
                        sources stating there is no intention to reorganize CATC into Sino-British
                        concern and the British stating that conversations in that direction have
                        taken place. According to British Commercial Counselor, the conversations
                        are only in a very preliminary stage and have been no more than exploratory
                        in regard to the question whether a Sino-British aviation concern would be
                        advisable. His attitude toward the matter was deprecatory and he remarked
                        that it seemed somewhat pointless as there existed no means of obtaining
                        planes for the enterprise. We shall continue discreetly to pursue the
                        matter.</p>

                        CDS for 5 planes as soon as possible in addition to usual monthly

                        greatly needed and later to so employ 3 more; that our Army has been
                        unwilling heretofore to release planes for internal service pending
                        attainment specified monthly inward freight movement through ATC but he
                        trusts they will now agree since quota was reached in December; that this
                        will further American interests besides providing urgently needed
                        communications; and that he hopes Hornbeck will support.</p>
                    <p>In connection with above I learn Ministry Communications desires 5 planes, 2

                        to China will be entrusted to CNAC for operation, I hope that, if these
                        planes are released to China, it will be definitely stipulated that they
                        shall be for operation by CNAC as the only organization now here competent
                        to fly and service American transport planes.</p>

                    <p>Reference is made to the attached letter from Mr. Currie of June 8,
                            1943,<note n="4" xml:id="d622fn4">Not printed; Lauchlin Currie was
                            Administrative Assistant to President Roosevelt.</note> forwarding for
                        consideration a letter from Mr. L. K. Little, an American citizen, long in
                        the Chinese Maritime Customs Service and one of the senior Commissioners of
                        that Service, who has been appointed to the post of Acting Inspector General
                        of Customs in succession to Sir Frederick Maze, a British subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Little is the first American to hold the post of Inspector General of
                        Customs. Before accepting the post Mr. Little informs us that he felt bound
                        in duty to accept the post although he realized that he would be faced with
                        many and perhaps insurmountable difficulties in his endeavors to prevent an
                        apparently planned reorganization of the Customs to eliminate therefrom the
                        foreign officers of various nationalities <pb n="688" xml:id="pg_688" facs="0698"/>whose general integrity, ability, and devotion to duty are
                        largely responsible for the maintenance of the Customs Service on an
                        efficient revenue-producing basis.</p>
                    <p>While this Government has not in years past taken the active interest in the
                        Customs and in the American members thereof which has been exhibited by the
                        British, French, Japanese, and other Governments, there have been occasions
                        when we have made approaches to the Chinese Government looking to the
                        maintenance of the administrative integrity of the Customs, which has been
                        the keystone of China’s foreign credit and on which have been secured a
                        number of foreign loans. Also, on a number of occasions, between the
                        commencement of the Sino-Japanese hostilities in 1937 and the outbreak of
                        war between the United States and Japan we have cooperated with the Chinese
                        Government in protesting against Japanese interference with the Customs in
                        occupied territory. It is believed that we should continue, not only for the
                        sake of American commercial interests but also for the sake of China’s own
                        interests, to support and pursue a policy looking to the maintenance of an
                        efficient Customs service and the retention of competently trained foreign
                        personnel until such time as the need of their services in the
                        reestablishment of the Customs Administration in the occupied areas has
                        ceased to exist, and they can be replaced by competent and otherwise
                        satisfactory Chinese officers.</p>
                    <p>It is accordingly suggested, with a view to facilitating Mr. Little’s task,
                        that Mr. Welles<note n="5" xml:id="d622fn5">Sumner Welles, Under Secretary
                            of State.</note> or Mr. Hornbeck might take occasion to discuss the
                        question of the Customs with Dr. T. V. Soong.<note n="6" xml:id="d622fn6">Attached is a note by the Adviser on Political Relations (Hornbeck): “I
                            concur in the above. I believe that the effectiveness of the making of
                            comments to Dr. Soong would be much greater if done by Mr. Welles than
                            if done by Mr. Hornbeck. SKH” Dr. T. V. Soong was Chinese Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs, temporarily in the United States. On June 21 Mr. Welles
                            informed Dr. Hornbeck that the Secretary of State had agreed with Mr.
                            Welles that Dr. Hornbeck should take this up with Dr. Soong.</note>
                        Suggested comments which might be made to Dr. Soong in this connection are
                        outlined in the underlying enclosure.<note n="7" xml:id="d622fn7">Not

               </p>
                    <p>It is believed that the issuance of a statement to the press, as suggested by
                        Mr. Little, would accomplish no useful purpose, and in addition might well
                        irritate the more extreme nationalistic elements in the Chinese Government
                        who are understood to be desirious of eliminating all foreign influence from
                        the Customs Service.</p>
                    <p>If the action proposed above is approved, it is suggested that FE be
                        authorized to inform Mr. Currie orally of the decision reached.</p>

                    <p>I discussed this subject with Dr. Soong last evening. Dr. Soong stated to me
                        that the Chinese Government fully realizes the importance and the value to
                        it of continuing to maintain the established Maritime Customs Administration
                        and retaining the services of those persons among the foreign personnel who
                        are effectively “useful, especially those who have technical knowledge and
                        experience”. He remarked that China would need for years to come the
                        services of foreign “experts and administrators”—if anything in increasing
                        numbers; he and other Chinese want to train Chinese personnel for various
                        types of service as rapidly as possible, and they are working at it, “but it
                        will take time”. Dr. Soong spoke highly of Mr. Little; and he and I
                        discussed, in agreement, Mr. Little’s qualifications and attitude and
                        potential usefulness. I expressed the hope and the belief that there would
                        be the best of cooperation between Mr. Little and his Chinese associates;
                        and Dr. Soong indicated his concurrence.</p>

                    <p>18. In connection with the forthcoming abolition of American extraterritorial
                        rights in China,<note n="1" xml:id="d624fn1">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_690">p. 690</ref>.</note> there arises the question of
                        the exercise of jurisdiction over American military personnel stationed in
                        that country at the invitation of the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>As you may be aware this Government has entered into arrangements with a
                        number of other countries whereby American military authorities in those
                        countries exercise criminal (but not civil) jurisdiction over military
                        personnel under their command. In an exchange of notes between the United
                        States and Great Britain of July 27, 1942,<note n="2" xml:id="d624fn2">Military Service Agreement effected by exchanges of notes signed or
                            dated at Washington, March 30, April 29, June 9, and September 30, 1942,
                            Department of State Executive Agreement Series No. 307, or 56 Stat.
                            1906.</note> for example, agreement was reached that the Service courts
                        and authorities of the United States forces should “exercise exclusive
                        jurisdiction in respect of criminal offenses which may be committed in the
                        United Kingdom by members of those forces.”</p>
                    <p>We have refrained heretofore from bringing this question to the attention of
                        the Chinese Government because we have desired to avoid the possibility that
                        such action might be misinterpreted as having relationship to or bearing
                        upon the negotiations concerning the treaty on extraterritoriality and
                        because it has been our desire that the treaty should make it clear that we
                        have no intention of retaining any vestiges of the old system.</p>
                    <p>The question presented is a practical one. It arose during the last World War
                        whenever troops of one country operated in the territory of another country
                        at the invitation of the latter country, and numerous agreements on the
                        subject were concluded between various countries. In our view, we have the
                        right under international law to exercise such jurisdiction without specific
                        agreement. In order, however, <pb n="692" xml:id="pg_692" facs="0702"/>to
                        avoid possible misunderstandings, arrangements were entered into by this
                        country with a number of countries during the last World War and are being
                        entered into during the present war.</p>
                    <p>It is requested that, in your discretion, you raise this question orally and
                        informally with Dr. Soong<note n="3" xml:id="d624fn3">T. V. Soong, Chinese
                            Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> and ask that he indicate his
                        opinion as to the most feasible way of proceeding in the matter. You may say
                        that it has been our thought here that it would be preferable to await the
                        signing of the treaty on extraterritoriality before approaching the Chinese
                        Government formally in the matter. It has also been our thought that it
                        would be desirable, in order to avoid possible misunderstandings in the
                        future, not to rely solely upon international law as a basis upon which to
                        assume that our military authorities in China would continue to exercise
                        criminal jurisdiction over American military personnel in that country. We
                        suggest that an appropriate arrangement might be effected by an informal
                        exchange of notes; and that the notes need not necessarily be published,
                        depending upon the wishes of the Chinese Government. Our note would read
                        somewhat as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>It is the desire of the Government of the United States that the
                                Service courts and authorities of its military and naval forces
                                shall during the continuance of the present conflict against our
                                common enemies exercise exclusive jurisdiction over criminal
                                offenses which may be committed in China by members of such
                                forces.</p>
                            <p>If cases arise in which for special reasons the Service authorities
                                of this Government may prefer not to exercise the above
                                jurisdiction, it is proposed that in any such case a written
                                statement to that effect shall be sent to the Chinese Government
                                through diplomatic channels, in which event it would be open to the
                                Chinese authorities to assume jurisdiction.</p>
                            <p>Assurance is given that the Service courts and authorities of the
                                United States forces in China will be willing and able to try and on
                                conviction to punish all criminal offenses which members of the
                                United States forces may be alleged on sufficient evidence to have
                                committed in China and that the United States authorities will be
                                willing in principle to investigate and deal appropriately with any
                                alleged criminal offenses committed by such forces in China which
                                may be brought to their attention by the competent Chinese
                                authorities or which the United States authorities may find have
                                taken place.</p>
                            <p>In so far as may be compatible with military security, the Service
                                authorities of the United States will conduct the trial of any
                                member of the United States forces for an offense against a member
                                of the civilian population promptly in open court and within a
                                reasonable distance from the place where the offense is alleged to
                                have been committed <pb n="693" xml:id="pg_693" facs="0703"/>so that
                                witnesses may not be required to travel great distances to attend
                                the trial.</p>
                            <p>The competent American authorities will be prepared to cooperate with
                                the authorities of China in setting up a satisfactory procedure for
                                affording such mutual assistance as may be required in making
                                investigations and collecting evidence with respect to offenses
                                alleged to have been committed by members of the armed forces of the
                                United States. As a general rule it would probably be desirable that
                                preliminary action should be taken by the Chinese authorities on
                                behalf of the American authorities where the witnesses or other
                                persons from whom it is desired to obtain testimony are not members
                                of the United States forces. In prosecutions in Chinese courts of
                                persons who are not members of the United States forces but where
                                members of such forces are in any way concerned the Service
                                authorities of the United States will be glad to render such
                                assistance as is possible in obtaining testimony of members of such
                                forces or in making appropriate investigations.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed that the foregoing arrangement shall be in effect
                                during the present war and for a period of six months
                                thereafter.</p>
                            <p>If the above arrangement is acceptable to the Chinese Government this
                                note and the reply thereto accepting the provisions outlined shall
                                be regarded as placing on record the understanding between our two
                                Governments. (End proposed note.)</p>

                    <p>The principal consideration in our mind is, of course, to provide for the

                    <p>43. I have discussed with Foreign Minister the subject of criminal
                        jurisdiction over American military personnel as directed in your 18,
                        January 4, 7 p.m. Soong stated he accepts the principle and is agreeable to
                        exchange of notes but suggests that the text of Anglo-American <pb n="694" xml:id="pg_694" facs="0704"/>notes on same subject be obtained and
                        followed as closely as possible. He remarked that this is lazy man’s
                        suggestion to avoid necessity of legal examination of texts but I suspect he
                        wishes to be able to assure the Generalissimo<note n="5" xml:id="d625fn5">Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese Executive Yuan
                            (Premier).</note> that we are treating with China on the same basis of
                        equality that we deal with Britain. I told Soong that I had no doubt our
                        draft of proposed exchange of notes followed substantially the arrangement
                        with Britain but that I did not have text of that arrangement. I await
                        Department’s further instructions.</p>

                    <p>I called in at military headquarters this afternoon to see General Stilwell
                        and informed him of the instructions contained in the Department’s telegram
                        no. 18, January 4, 7 p.m., in reference to criminal jurisdiction over
                        American military personnel in China following the coming into force of the
                        Sino-American treaty relinquishing American extraterritorial rights in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>I mentioned that it was my understanding that China and India had reached
                        some arrangement regarding military jurisdiction in criminal cases in
                        respect to the Chinese forces now at Ramgarh, India; and that there is also
                        an understanding with Britain regarding American military personnel in
                        India—and in the United Kingdom. I inquired whether he had the texts of any
                        of these arrangements. He had not; but General Hearn, his Chief of Staff,
                        had a copy of the British orders in India regarding jurisdiction over
                        American and Chinese military personnel, and upon examining it General
                        Stilwell mentioned that the provisions are similar in the two instances
                        except that in the case of the American military establishments there is
                        exemption from search by the British authorities while this exemption does
                        not hold true in reference to the Chinese encampments.</p>
                    <p>I asked General Stilwell whether he had any comments or suggestions to make
                        in connection with my approach to Dr. Soong, the <pb n="695" xml:id="pg_695" facs="0705"/>Foreign Minister, in accordance with my instructions from
                        Washington. He replied that he had nothing to offer; the proposed move is
                        entirely in line with the desires of the military.</p>

                        <item>In response to an inquiry made by the Ambassador prior to his
                            departure whether the Chinese Government wished to treat as confidential
                            the exchange of notes in regard to criminal jurisdiction over American
                            military personnel in China, Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated
                            that it intends to publish the exchange of notes.</item>

                        <item>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated its desire that the exchange
                            take place the day after the exchange of ratifications of the new treaty
                            is made in Washington and I feel, and so do our military authorities,
                            that for obvious reasons it would be preferable to exchange the notes on
                            the day ratifications are exchanged, but shall not make a point of the
                            matter unless the Department instructs me to do so.</item>
                        <label>3.</label>
                        <item>Recently the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed with me
                            certain proposals for changing our draft note. He had seen the British
                            Parliamentary Act for implementing our agreement with Great Britain and
                            desired to have incorporated in our note a reservation with regard to
                            the Chinese Government’s powers of arrest, search, entry or custody and
                            another reservation of the Chinese Government’s right “to define by such
                            regulation or orders as it may consider necessary or proper, the manner
                            and means of determining, for purposes of this understanding, what
                            persons shall be deemed to be members of <pb n="697" xml:id="pg_697" facs="0707"/>the military and naval forces of the United States of
                            America in China.” It will be recalled that the British Act contains
                            sections along the lines of these two reservations. After several
                            subsequent discussions I persuaded the Foreign Office that it would not
                            be appropriate to include these reservations in the exchange of notes.
                            The Acting Foreign Minister frankly admitted that question of face was
                            largely responsible for issue having been raised. It is probable now
                            that the Supreme National Defense Council, which raised the issue, or
                            the Legislative Yuan, will adopt some kind of regulation or law along
                            the lines of the British Act. I have pointed out that such regulation or
                            law should implement and facilitate operation of the agreement rather
                            than modify it.</item>

                        suspense; and (2) whether, in such case, payment would continue to be made
                        by the Chinese Government to the American Government for transfer to the
                        China Foundation (it is understood that under procedure existing before the
                        war the Foreign Office delivered to the American Consulate General at

                    <p>I discussed this matter with Mr. Hiss<note n="6" xml:id="d633fn6">Alger Hiss,

                        subsequent to October 1, 1917, et cetera. I said that it appeared that such
                        authorization and direction was given by the President in the light of
                        various considerations, as follows: that a Joint Resolution of Congress

                        authorized the President in his discretion to remit to China all future
                        payments of the annual installments of the Chinese indemnity; that the

                        funds.</p>
                    <p>I went on to say to Mr. Liu that it accordingly seemed that, although the
                        proposed treaty on extraterritoriality would terminate any rights of this
                        Government in regard to Boxer Indemnity funds (whether future funds or
                        whether past funds due but not yet paid) and would therefore eliminate this
                        Government as an agency in any transaction involving the paying of such
                        funds from the Chinese Government to the China Foundation, the treaty would
                        not <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> affect the relations of the Chinese
                        Government with the Board and would not affect any obligations of the
                        Chinese Government to the Board such <pb n="703" xml:id="pg_703" facs="0713"/>as those indicated in the Executive Order above mentioned. I added that
                        accordingly it seemed to me that there rested on the Chinese Government some
                        legal as well as moral obligation to pay to the Board the sums due but not
                        paid up to the time of the coming into effect of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>At Mr. Liu’s request I told him that we would send him a copy of the
                        Executive Order in question and subsequently did so.</p>

                    <p>79. In conversation last evening Dr. Wong Wen Hao, who is active here as one
                        of trustees of China Foundation for Promotion of Education and Culture,
                        commented that the new American treaty would seem to raise the question
                        whether the balance of Boxer Indemnity payments is eventually to be paid by
                        China for remission to the Foundation which, as the Department knows, was
                        established with Indemnity funds and which has been borrowing from the
                        Government banks on security of future payments due from China but suspended
                        during the war. He asked my opinion on the point. While I had in mind the
                        conversation at the Department on October 26 with the Minister Counselor of
                        the Chinese Embassy as communicated to me in your instruction 158 of
                        November 20,<note n="13" xml:id="d634fn13">Instruction not printed; for text
                            of memorandum of October 26, 1942, by the Assistant Chief of the

                        point may not have been studied specifically and in detail by the
                        Department. Am I authorized to give any expression of opinion, formal or
                        informal, on the point?</p>
                    <p>But for the conversation at Washington referred to, I would have concluded
                        that our relinquishment of rights under Boxer Protocol<note n="14" xml:id="d634fn14">Signed at Peking, September 7, 1901, <ref target="frus1901China#pg_312">

                        China Foundation. I doubt whether British consider treaty as affecting Boxer
                        Indemnity but have not deemed it advisable to discuss point with my British
                        colleague without prior consultation with the Department.</p>

                    <p>113. Your 79, January 15, noon. The statement of October 26 by an officer of
                        the Department to the Minister Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, mentioned
                        in your telegram under reference, that “Article II made clear provision that
                        any and all rights accorded to this Government under the Boxer Protocol and
                        under agreements supplementary thereto shall cease” was the considered
                        opinion of the Department, formulated after consultation with the Treasury
                        Department. The British Government was informed of this opinion and
                        expressed concurrence therewith. The phrase “any and all rights” was
                        intended to cover also the bond given by the Chinese Government pursuant to
                        the Protocol, and the Department will expect so to interpret Article II of
                        the Chinese-American treaty of January 11<note n="15" xml:id="d635fn15">Department of State Treaty Series No. 984, or 57 Stat. 767.</note> when
                        the treaty is ratified and comes into effect.</p>
                    <p>On December 9, 1942, the Minister Counselor of the Chinese Embassy inquired,
                        on the basis of a telegraphic inquiry from Dr. Wong Wen-hao to Dr. Hu Shih,
                        whether under the new treaty there would continue any obligation on the part
                        of the Chinese Government to pay to the China Foundation the remitted sums,
                        payment of which had been held in suspense. In response, an officer of the
                        Department stated as an informal opinion that although the treaty would
                        terminate any rights of this Government in regard to Boxer Indemnity funds
                        and would therefore eliminate this Government as an agency in any
                        transaction involving payment of such funds from the Chinese Government to
                        the China Foundation, the treaty would not <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi>
                        affect the relations of the Chinese Government with the Board of Trustees of
                        the China Foundation; and that it seemed that there rested upon the Chinese
                        Government some legal as well as moral obligation to pay to the Board the
                        sums due but not paid up to the time of the coming into effect of the
                        treaty. (A memorandum of this conversation went forward to you by mail and
                        should reach you shortly.)</p>
                    <p>Upon the coming into effect of the treaty, the relationship between the
                        Chinese Government and the China Foundation will, in the Department’s
                        opinion be a matter for determination by and between those entities—with due
                        respect for the considerations advanced above. However, the Department feels
                        that if representatives of the China Foundation for its part should request
                        the Department’s opinion as to the obligations of the Chinese Government to
                        the Foundation, the Department’s views as indicated above should be
                        expressed informally to the inquirers. Similarly, if Chinese officials
                        should raise the question, <pb n="705" xml:id="pg_705" facs="0715"/>they
                        also should be informally given our views and the inquirer be informed in
                        addition that we would feel obligated to express the same opinion if inquiry
                        should be made by representatives of the Foundation. You are accordingly
                        authorized to speak for the Department along the lines indicated, if and
                        when occasion therefor arises.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Sze called at his request on Mr. Hamilton this morning.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Sze stated that he and Dr. Hu Shih had recently received a telegram from
                        Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Chinese Minister of Economics in Chungking, one of the
                        trustees of the China Foundation, in regard to the question of the rights of
                        the Foundation to Boxer Indemnity funds. It was stated in the telegram that
                        Dr. Wong had mentioned this matter to Ambassador Gauss; that Mr. Gauss said
                        he would refer it to Washington; that there had also been some discussion by
                        Dr. Wong with Dr. T. V. Soong<note n="17" xml:id="d636fn17">Chinese Minister
                            for Foreign Affairs.</note> and Dr. Sun Fo;<note n="18" xml:id="d636fn18">President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan.</note> that
                        Dr. Soong and Dr. Sun Fo had indicated that they felt that the work of the
                        Foundation should go on; that Dr. Soong had said he would endeavor to obtain
                        the Generalissimo’s<note n="19" xml:id="d636fn19">Chiang Kai-shek, President
                            of the Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier).</note> approval; that Dr. Soong
                        had also stated, however, that payments to the Foundation would cease upon
                        the coming into effect of the new treaty on extraterritoriality; and that
                        certain influential people in the Chinese Government considered that the
                        Chinese Government should take over the Foundation’s fund.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hamilton stated that Mr. Gauss had telegraphed the Department in regard
                        to the question of what obligations might rest on the Chinese Government to
                        continue paying to the Foundation remitted Boxer Indemnity funds. The
                        Department had informally, in response to the inquiry, expressed the opinion
                        that Article II of the new treaty made it clear that all of this
                        Government’s rights under the Boxer <pb n="706" xml:id="pg_706" facs="0716"/>Protocol and under supplementary agreements thereto would cease upon the
                        coming into effect of the new treaty on extraterritoriality; that this
                        Government’s rights in regard to the bond given by the Chinese Government
                        pursuant to the Protocol would also cease; that although this Government’s
                        rights in regard to Boxer Indemnity funds would be terminated by the treaty
                        and this Government would therefore be eliminated as an agency in any
                        transaction involving payment of such funds to the China Foundation by the
                        Chinese Government, it seemed to us that there rested upon the Chinese
                        Government some legal as well as moral obligation to pay to the Foundation
                        the remitted sums due but not paid up to the time of the coming into effect
                        of the treaty. Mr. Atcheson went on to say that it is our opinion that the
                        treaty will not itself affect the relationship between the Chinese
                        Government and the Foundation; that such relationship will be a matter for
                        determination by those two organizations, with due regard for the
                        considerations mentioned above; but that, as Mr. Hamilton mentioned, the
                        Chinese Government would, in the light of the considerations upon which the
                        Boxer Indemnity payments had been remitted, seem to have legal as well as
                        moral obligation to continue to hand over to the Foundation sums due but not
                        paid up to the time of the coming into effect of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Sze asked whether he could construe the informal expression of opinion
                        given by the Department as meaning or implying that the Department expected
                        that the China Foundation would continue in existence. Mr. Hamilton and Mr.
                        Atcheson replied that the Department’s comment carried with it, in their
                        opinion, an assumption that the China Foundation would continue in existence
                        as long as and in so far as that were made possible by the payment to it of
                        payments in arrears up to the time of the going into effect of the treaty on
                        extraterritoriality.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Sze had referred to the fact that he was in Washington as Chinese
                        Minister at the time when there had been worked out the procedure under
                        which this Government had in 1925 made remission of the remaining Boxer
                        Indemnity funds. Dr. Sze said that the term “Foundation” had been used
                        because there had been a desire to have the remitted funds constitute a
                        permanent fund for the purposes mentioned, which fund would always be a
                        memorial of the liberal and generous attitude of this Government. Dr. Sze
                        indicated that he was of the opinion that remitted funds already paid to the
                        Foundation were the property of the Foundation and constituted a direct gift
                        to the Foundation from the American Government. Dr. Sze said that the China
                        Foundation was a legal entity under Chinese law and that in his opinion the
                        Chinese Government had no more right to take over <pb n="707" xml:id="pg_707" facs="0717"/>the funds of the China Foundation than it
                        would have to take over the funds of any other Chinese legal person. With
                        regard to this last mentioned point, Mr. Hamilton stated that this question
                        had not previously been raised with the Department. Neither Mr. Hamilton nor
                        Mr. Atcheson gave any expression of opinion on the point.</p>
                    <p>After further informal discussion of various aspects of the Foundation’s
                        activities and problems, and thanking Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Atcheson, Dr. Sze
                        departed.</p>

                        I have been informed by Cabinet Minister that at a meeting of the Executive
                        Yuan on the 23rd the question of China Foundation was discussed. Memorandum
                        prepared by Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Education recommended
                        that payments in arrears up to time of the coming into effect of new treaty
                        should be made; that there should be no subsequent payments; but that
                        Foundation should continue in existence with what funds it had and might
                        receive as donations. Ensuing discussion revealed that Minister of Education
                        wished to become <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> member of the Board of
                        Trustees or to have the right to appoint a member. It also revealed that,
                        although Ministry of Education was party to the memorandum, followers of
                        Minister of Education at the meeting (Minister of Social Affairs and
                        Secretary General of Executive Yuan[)] favored dissolution of Foundation and
                        transfer of its functions to Ministry of Education. I am informed the
                        Generalissimo, Kung,<note n="21" xml:id="d637fn21">H. H. Kung, Chinese
                            Minister of Finance.</note> and Soong favor continued existence of
                        Foundation but nationalistic elements represented by “CC<note n="22" xml:id="d637fn22">Chen brothers, Kuo-fu and Li-fu.</note> clique”
                        members feel that Foundation will be inconsonant with China’s new position
                        of full equality after relinquishment of extraterritoriality. Kung took
                        little part in discussion and adjourned meeting without decision. I am
                        informed, however, that affirmative decision on the memorandum will be taken
                        but that question of meeting Education Minister’s desire to be represented
                        on Board may cause difficulties.</p>

                        been raised with us before by Dr. Alfred Sze, former Chinese Minister and a
                        member of the Board of the China Foundation, and by Mr. Liu Chieh, Minister
                        Counselor of the Chinese Embassy. Dr. Kan said that he understood that there
                        were elements in the Government at Chungking which wished to alter the
                        constitution of the Board although in what way he did not know; he wished to
                        discuss the matter informally; and he requested an informal opinion from me
                        as to what obligation might continue to rest on the Chinese Government to
                        hand over to the China Foundation payments of Boxer Indemnity funds which
                        were in suspense, and also an opinion in regard to possible changes in the
                        Board’s constitution.</p>
                    <p>In reply I referred to conversations on this subject held with Mr. Liu Chieh
                        on December 9, 1942 and with Dr. Sze on February 18 [<hi rend="italic">8</hi>], 1943, went over the ground covered in those conversations and
                        repeated the opinion which we had expressed on those occasions to the effect
                        that Article II of the new treaty on extraterritoriality made it clear that
                        all of this Government’s rights under the Boxer Protocol and under
                        supplementary agreements thereto would cease upon the coming into effect of
                        the treaty; that although this Government’s rights in regard to Boxer
                        Indemnity funds would be terminated by the treaty and this Government would
                        therefore be eliminated as an agency in any transaction involving payment of
                        such funds to the China Foundation by the Chinese Government, it seemed to
                        us that there rested upon the Chinese Government some legal as well as moral
                        obligation to pay to the Foundation the remitted sums due but not <pb n="709" xml:id="pg_709" facs="0719"/>paid up to the time of the coming
                        into effect of the treaty; that termination of extraterritoriality under the
                        new treaty would not itself affect the relationship between the Chinese
                        Government and the Foundation; that such relationship would be a matter for
                        determination by those two organizations, with due regard for the
                        considerations mentioned above; but that the Chinese Government would, in
                        the light of the considerations upon which the Boxer Indemnity payments had
                        been remitted pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order No. 4268, July
                        16, 1925, seem to have legal as well as moral obligations to continue to
                        hand over to the Foundation sums due but not paid up to the time of the
                        coming into effect of the treaty.</p>
                    <p>I made it clear to Dr. Kan that this opinion had been expressed previously as
                        now not upon our own initiative but in response to request for such an
                        opinion and mentioned that in addition to such request from Dr. Sze and Mr.
                        Liu Chieh, the Chinese Minister of Economics in Chungking, Dr. Wong Wen-hao,
                        had made a similar request of our Embassy there and the Embassy had been
                        instructed to convey to Dr. Wong the opinion in question. I showed to Dr.
                        Kan a copy of the Executive Order mentioned previously, and at his request,
                        told him that I would be glad to send a copy to him.</p>
                    <p>As regards the question of changes in the constitution of the Board, I said
                        that I was not familiar with the provisions of the constitution and that if
                        he could not find a copy of the constitution in his Embassy, I would
                        endeavor to obtain the text. After some general discussion of this country’s
                        longstanding cultural interest in and ties with China and an exchange of the
                        usual amenities during which Dr. Kan expressed his thanks, he departed.</p>

                        few remarks in regard to the negotiation of the treaty between the United
                        States and China relating to extraterritoriality.<note n="1a" xml:id="d639fn3">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_690">p.
                            690</ref>.</note> In this connection Dr. Soong observed that he thought
                        it would be well to begin work on a comprehensive treaty between the two
                        countries, as negotiation of such treaty would require a good deal of time.
                        He observed, further, that we might furnish them copies of a number of our
                        recent standard comprehensive treaties.<note n="2" xml:id="d639fn2">On March
                            10, the Adviser on Political Relations (Hornbeck) gave Dr. Soong a
                            collection of modern American treaties of commerce; see Mr. Hornbeck’s
                            memorandum of conversation, <ref target="#pg_769">p. 769</ref>.</note>
                        He indicated that there was definite advantage in following the standard
                        form of our modern treaties.</p>
                    <p>Comment:</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong’s observations, as recorded above, were of a somewhat casual
                        nature. I did not enter into discussion of the subject with him. I do not
                        regard his observations as constituting definite approach to the Department
                        with suggestion that we undertake now discussions with China relating to
                        negotiation of a comprehensive, modern treaty as provided for in Article VII
                        in the treaty on extraterritoriality. I do regard his observations, however,
                        as rather clear indication that we may expect an approach from the Chinese
                        Government in the matter in the reasonably near future.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the Department should give prompt consideration to the
                        question of what attitude it is most advisable for this Government to take,
                        both in reference to the substance of any such treaty and to the question of
                        procedure, if and when the Chinese approach the Department.</p>

                        conclusion of a treaty of commerce with China.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after his return to Washington from China some two months ago, the
                        Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. T. V. Soong, when calling upon
                        officers of the Department, stated that he thought it would be well to begin
                        work on a comprehensive treaty of commerce between the United States and
                        China such as is envisaged in the recently concluded treaty on
                        extraterritoriality. Dr. Soong intimated that he thought that the
                        negotiation of such a treaty would require a good deal of time. He requested
                        that he be furnished with copies of several of the more recent commercial
                        treaties concluded by this Government with other Governments.</p>
                    <p>Article VII of the extraterritoriality treaty between the United States and
                        China provides that “upon the request of either Government” the American and
                        the Chinese Governments will “enter into negotiations for the conclusion of
                        a comprehensive modern treaty of friendship, commerce, navigation and
                        consular rights”.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, in commenting in reply to Dr. Soong’s observations, an officer
                        of the Department stated that he was sure that there would be a general
                        willingness here to proceed in the direction of a negotiation of a new
                        treaty of commerce; that there would in all probability be required a
                        considerable period for study and preparation, both by the Chinese and by
                        us; and that there would doubtless be a period of conversations and
                        comparing of notes, together with observation of current political and
                        economic developments before the stage would be reached at which formal
                        negotiations might to advantage be begun.</p>
                    <p>Copies of texts of treaties, as requested by Dr. Soong, were subsequently
                        supplied to Dr. Soong.</p>
                    <p>We have assumed that the Chinese made a similar approach to the British
                        Government; and shall be glad to exchange information and views with the
                        British Government as further developments occur.</p>

                    <p>On April 22 and again on May 3 Mr. Jopson, speaking informally over the phone
                        to Mr. Hawkins (TA),<note n="4" xml:id="d641fn4">Harry Hawkins, Chief of the
                            Division of Commercial Policy and Agreements.</note> inquired whether
                        the United States was disposed to negotiate, at the present time, a new
                        commercial treaty with China. He indicated that the British Government would
                        not view favorably a proposal by the Chinese Government to open negotiations
                        at the present time and hoped that the United States concurred in this view.
                        Mr. Jopson’s inquiry was discussed with Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Hamilton and
                        arrangements were made for Mr. Jopson and Mr. Hayter to call at the
                        Department on May 6 to discuss the matter.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jopson opened the conversation by explaining that Dr. T. V. Soong, before
                        leaving Chungking last February, had mentioned to the British Ambassador
                        there the possibility of beginning work on a Treaty of Commerce between
                        China and Great Britain and that the subject had been brought up in such a
                        way that the Ambassador interpreted it not as a formal proposal but as a
                        feeler designed to ascertain the attitude of the British Government. Mr.
                        Jopson and Mr. Hayter explained that their Government questioned the
                        advisability of beginning negotiations because the future, especially the
                        post-war settlement, was so uncertain. They raised a question as to whether
                        a commercial treaty negotiated in the near future might not later be found
                        to conflict with the operation of some international organization set up
                        under the auspices of the United Nations as, for example, an organization
                        designed to promote international currency stabilization. They suggested
                        that some conflict might develop with arrangements implementing the Atlantic

                    <p>Mr. Hamilton recounted the conversations, in so far as they related to the
                        proposed treaty, between officers of the Department and Dr. Soong since his
                        return from Chungking and a copy of the attached typed statement<note n="8" xml:id="d641fn8">
                     <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> was handed to Mr.
                        Jopson and Mr. Hayter. It was explained that the statement was informal and
                        should be considered in no sense a communication to the British
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Jopson and Mr. Hayter were told that the Department feels that there
                        might be considerable advantages to proceeding with the negotiation of a new
                        commercial treaty before the end of the war; that the commercial provisions
                        of any such treaty that we would negotiate would be general in nature and
                        would be similar to the commercial provisions of analogous treaties with
                        other countries; and that we do not perceive how the treaty would conflict
                        with any United Nations organization or policies implementing the Atlantic
                        Charter or Lend-Lease Agreements. It was pointed out that the preliminary
                        work leading up to negotiations, as well as the negotiations themselves,
                        could be expected to take a long time. It was, however, made clear that
                        representatives of the Department have indicated to Dr. Soong a general
                        willingness to proceed in the direction of the negotiation of a new treaty
                        and that we do not expect to “stall” or otherwise delay unnecessarily
                        conclusion of the proposed treaty.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Hornbeck</hi>: On May 7th [<hi rend="italic">6th</hi>] you were good enough to discuss with Mr. Hayter and myself
                        your projected negotiations with China for the conclusion of a treaty of
                        commerce. At that meeting you handed us an unofficial memorandum in which
                        you stated that the State Department would be glad to exchange information
                        and views with the British Government as further developments occurred.</p>
                    <p>We have now received a reply from the Foreign Office to the effect that they
                        are grateful for this undertaking and glad to accept your suggestion.</p>
                    <p>The Foreign Office ask us to explain that as our treaty practice is adapted
                        to our own needs and experience (as no doubt is that of the United States
                        Government) it would probably be embarrassing to us both if negotiations
                        which we eventually undertake were to be prejudiced by prior commitments of
                        either one of us. In these circumstances <pb n="714" xml:id="pg_714" facs="0724"/>it is of importance that we may rely on the State
                        Department to give us due notice of any significant developments and the
                        Foreign Office will, of course, for their part, do likewise.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Jopson</hi>: I acknowledge receipt of your
                        letter of June 23 regarding exchange of information in connection with
                        questions of policy and action relating to conclusion with China of treaties
                        of commerce.</p>
                    <p>It has been the understanding of officers of the Department who were parties
                        to the conversation held on May 7 [<hi rend="italic">6</hi>] that there was
                        reached a consensus of opinion that the matters then discussed might most
                        appropriately and to greatest advantage be dealt with informally. As was
                        then indicated, we share with you the desire and hope that the British
                        Government and the American Government will keep each other informed of any
                        significant developments in relation to those matters. We are glad to have
                        now the information given in your letter under acknowledgment. So far as
                        this Government is concerned there have been since the moment of the

                    <p>In the course of the informal conversations to which I was a party during my
                        recent visit to London, officers of the Far Eastern Department of the
                            BFO<note n="9" xml:id="d644fn9">British Foreign Office.</note> brought
                        up the subject of negotiating (if and when) new commercial treaties with
                        China. [See memoranda of conversations held here during the current year
                        with T. V. Soong and with officers of the British Embassy on the same
                            subject.]<note n="10" xml:id="d644fn10">Brackets appear in the
                            original.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>My British opposites expounded British official thought on the subject in the
                        same terms in which that thought had been communicated to us here during
                        recent months. I responded by explaining our <pb n="715" xml:id="pg_715" facs="0725"/>thought as it previously had been explained by us here to
                        officers of the British Embassy. I mentioned our conversations with T. V.
                        Soong. I explained that we have at no time considered it desirable to hold
                        the Chinese at arms length on this subject; that we are prepared to discuss
                        with the Chinese the possibilities and potentialities of a new treaty; that
                        we make a distinction between “conversations” and “negotiations”; that we
                        feel that either or both of these procedures would involve a protracted
                        period of discussion, etc.; and that we see no reason to worry over the
                        question of possible disadvantages which might accrue from dealing with this
                        subject before the war is ended and peace settlements are concluded. I
                        pointed out that there will probably be substantial differences at the
                        outset between what we (and the British) would envisage as the desirable
                        contents of a new commercial treaty and what the Chinese would envisage;
                        that we feel that advantages would probably derive from comparing the
                        differences and trying to bridge the gap while the war effort is still on;
                        and that there need not necessarily be envisaged the final concluding of a
                        treaty before or until shortly before or shortly after the concluding of
                        some at least of the peace arrangements. I said, further, that during recent
                        months the Chinese had made no mention whatever of this subject; that we had
                        reason to believe that T. V. Soong was having the matter studied by their
                        officialdom; and that I would not be surprised if when he returns from China
                        he brings a draft. I said that our technicians are working on a draft and
                        have made considerable progress with it. I added that I should not want to
                        have it happen that the Chinese present us with a draft and we be not
                        prepared at the same time and immediately to present them with a draft
                        indicative of our thought on the subject. I said that I intended when I
                        returned to Washington to ask our people to speed up our work on the draft.
                        And, I gently hinted that it seemed to me that it might be to their
                        advantage were the British to proceed along similar lines.</p>
                    <p>My British opposites commented that what I had said brought to their minds a
                        number of points which had not theretofore occurred to them and that,
                        generally speaking, it put the matter in a new light. Further, they said,
                        they would carefully reconsider the subject in the light of this exchange of
                        views.</p>

                        to Dr. Wu’s attention the various cases of occupation of American property
                        which had been and are still a cause of concern to the Embassy. Mr. Gauss
                        said that he had taken the matter up with Dr. Soong<note n="2" xml:id="d645fn2">T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign

                        mentioned five of the outstanding cases and handed Dr. Wu copy of an
                        informal memo<note n="3" xml:id="d645fn3">Not printed.</note> which Mr.
                        Horace Smith, Secretary of the Embassy, had prepared on the subject. Mr.

                            extraterritoriality<note n="4" xml:id="d645fn4">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_690">p. 690</ref>.</note> these cases of occupation
                        occasioned him special concern and that he disliked returning home to have
                        to report that nothing had been accomplished in response to the Embassy’s
                        representations. Mr. Vincent invited particular attention to the case of
                        occupation by the China Transport Company of a building belonging to the
                        Methodist Mission at Chungking. He said that the Embassy itself planned to
                        lease this building and urged Dr. Wu to take steps to compel the CTC to
                        remove by April 1 when the Embassy expected to occupy the building. Dr. Wu
                        said that he would forward the matter to the Minister of Communications and
                        would do what he could to have the building vacated about April l.<note n="5" xml:id="d645fn5">This building was duly vacated and after

                    <p>Dr. Wu said that he would take measures to obtain the return of the various
                        properties to the rightful owners. He remarked, humorously, that
                        instructions had been issued to various provincial and district officials
                        ordering that foreign property and personal interests should be given even
                        greater protection and consideration upon the relinquishment of
                        extraterritoriality than they had been given heretofore.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador also mentioned to Dr. Wu the various restrictions that were
                        placed upon Americans who desired to travel in China. He pointed out that an
                        American, he understood, could not obtain authorization to travel in more
                        than two provinces; that in order to obtain even this limited authority he
                        must send his passport to the Embassy which in turn had to send it to the
                        Foreign Office for the authorization and that there was also the matter of
                        obtaining permits from local authorities to travel. He said that Chinese in
                        America with valid visaes could travel about without restriction. Dr. Wu
                        said that China was at war. Mr. Gauss said that America was at war also. Dr.
                        Wu said that the restrictions were placed upon the travel of foreigners for
                        their own protection; that China had been at war for some six years; and
                        that conditions were such as to make it necessary to keep some check on the
                        movement of foreigners. He stated as his belief that Chinese travelers were
                        subjected to greater restrictions than were foreigners and that particular
                        efforts were made to facilitate the movement of Americans. In conclusion Dr.
                        Wu said however that he would give his attention, as the Ambassador had
                        requested, to finding some means of simplifying and making less troublesome
                        restrictions on travel.</p>
                    <p>In connection with the matter of travel, the Ambassador also mentioned the
                        surveillance to which Americans were subjected by local police, gendarmes,
                        and other Government agents. Their private affairs were pried into and they
                        were continuously being asked to furnish information largely of a personal
                        character. He said that such methods in China made a very bad impression on
                        foreigners. Dr. Wu said he regretted this and would give the matter his
                        attention.</p>

                        the Embassy has received a report of an incident which occurred on April 4,
                        1943 in which Mr. Arthur Mazat and Mr. Francis Derk, American citizens of
                        the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, Lanchow, and the Christian <pb n="718" xml:id="pg_718" facs="0728"/>and Missionary Alliance, Wenchow,
                        respectively, who are currently registered with the Consulate General in
                        Kunming, were attacked by bandits at Lo Chia Mo, near Feng Shui Lin, on the
                        highway between Minhsien and Lintao, south of Lanchow. Mr. Mazat and Mr.
                        Derk were taken from their automobile and after being maltreated and robbed
                        were detained overnight. The next day they were partially recompensed for
                        their losses and were released; it does not appear that they suffered any
                        serious or permanent bodily harm.</p>
                    <p>There are herewith enclosed for the Department’s information copies of (1)

                        <p>The American Embassy presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign
                            Affairs and has the honor to inform the Ministry that it has received a
                            letter dated April 22, 1943 from Arthur Mazat, an American citizen
                            residing at the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, Lanchow, Kansu, which
                            reports the following incident:</p>
                        <p>On April 4, 1943 Mr. Mazat, together with Mr. Francis Derk, also an
                            American citizen, were attacked by armed bandits at Lo Chia Mo, near
                            Feng Shui Lin, on the highway between Minhsien and Lintao, south of
                            Lanchow. The automobile in which they were proceeding was fired upon and
                            then stopped by a group of bandits numbering over a thousand. Mr. Mazat
                            and Mr. Derk were taken from the automobile, were bound, and their
                            clothes were torn. They were threatened with decapitation, were beaten,
                            and then menaced with guns. Finally they were robbed and the windows of
                            their automobile were broken. The men were detained overnight and on
                            April 5, 1943 were released and allowed to proceed after being given an
                            amount of money equivalent to only a small portion of the value of the
                            personal possessions taken from them. The military commander at Lintao
                                <pb n="719" xml:id="pg_719" facs="0729"/>was informed of the
                            incident, upon their arrival at that place, and he facilitated their
                            return to Lanchow.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Mazat states that before making the trip the advice and the approval
                            of government officials at Minhsien had been obtained. Upon the
                            recommendation of those officials the trip had been postponed for ten
                            days and at the time of their departure assurances had been given that
                            the highway was patrolled by soldiers for its entire length and was safe
                            for travel. One of the bandit leaders is believed to have been a former
                            government official at Minhsien named Li. Another of the leaders is
                            believed to have been called Fu Shih Ling.</p>
                        <p>The Ministry is requested to investigate this matter and to secure the
                            apprehension of guilty parties and to obtain restitution of the property
                            stolen from Mr. Mazat and Mr. Derk and compensation for the damages they
                            have suffered.</p>
                        <p>The Embassy would appreciate being informed of the results of the
                            Ministry’s action.</p>

                        No. 1135 of May 3, 1943 in regard to an attack by bandits on two American
                        citizens in Kansu Province with which was enclosed a copy of the Embassy’s
                        note to the Foreign Office dated May 1, 1943 on this subject. The Embassy
                        has now received a reply from the Foreign Office dated June 24, 1943, a
                        translation of which is enclosed.<note n="7" xml:id="d647fn7">Not

               </p>
                    <p>It will be noted that in its reply the Foreign Office states that the bandits
                        have been attacked by Chinese troops and that when their leaders are
                        captured they will be punished according to law but that it would be
                        impossible to recover the articles of which the two Americans were robbed.
                        In a further note to the Foreign Office of today’s date, a copy of which is

                    <p>1993. Consul [at] Kunming<note n="9" xml:id="d648fn9">Raymond P.
                            Ludden.</note> reports that American military convoy proceeding from
                        Kunming to Wenshan on morning October 16 attacked by 15 to 20 Chinese
                        bandits; some wearing uniform of local militia, at point some 15 kilometers
                        southeast of Iliang. Bandits were engaged in looting several Chinese
                        civilian trucks and blocked road caused American convoy to halt. Bandits
                        demanded surrender of American arms and opened fire inflicting casualties.
                        Fire was returned and in ensuing exchange five American officers seriously
                        wounded, two bandits known killed and three wounded. Area in which attack
                        occurred is under Provincial Government control. Ludden says banditry on
                        border of Ilianghsien and Lunanhsien has been rife for some time and no
                        effective action has been taken by local magistrates to halt it. He states
                        present incident is one of several all less serious which have occurred
                        during past few months in areas under Provincial Government control
                        southeast of Kunming.</p>
                    <p>Ludden has made representations to Provincial Government through special
                        delegate [of] Foreign Affairs. He states that he is “demanding” that
                        incident be reported personally to Governor with a “demand” for immediate
                        investigation and report, apprehension of culprits, establishment of
                        responsibility of local officials, adequate punishments, apologies from
                        responsible officials, adequate assurances against such occurrences in the
                        future and that he is reserving right to make further “demands” if deemed
                        necessary by higher American authorities. Ludden’s communication was
                        supported by written protest of Chief of Staff, American Forces,
                        Kunming.</p>
                    <p>Embassy is telegraphing Ludden that he should keep Embassy fully and promptly
                        informed, that his action in bringing incident promptly to attention of
                        Provincial Government for full investigation and effective measures for
                        apprehension of bandits is approved, but that he should make no “demands”
                        unless and until so instructed and that there should be no publicity.</p>
                    <p>I am bringing matter orally to serious attention of Foreign Minister. There
                        has been no publicity here.</p>

                    <p>2006. Embassy’s 1993, October 21. I called on Soong this morning by
                        appointment, informed him of the incident (he said he had not previously
                        heard of it) left with him a factual statement marked “oral” based on
                        Kunming’s report and said that I had reported to the Department that I would
                        bring the matter orally to his earnest attention. I said I felt confident I
                        had only to bring this matter to his attention to be certain that it would
                        receive earnest attention by Chinese Government and prompt and effective
                        measures and that I believed it to be one which the Generalissimo<note n="10" xml:id="d649fn10">Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese
                            National Government.</note> would wish brought to his personal
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Soong said he would bring matter to attention of Government without delay and
                        to Generalissimo as soon as possible and that I could be assured prompt
                        action would be taken.</p>

                    <p>2026. My 2006, October 22, 3 p.m. regarding bandit attack on Army motor
                        convoy in Yunnan. Foreign Office tells me incident was reported to
                        Generalissimo and that National Government has issued strong instructions.
                        Consul [at] Kunming reports matter was brought to personal attention of
                        Chairman Lung Yun of Provincial Government who has charged the magistrates
                        concerned to deal with the situation under supervision of a provincial
                        commissioner. Ludden has suggested that on the one hand it would not be
                        difficult to obtain punishment of the magistrates by dismissal but on the
                        other hand the situation may be used by General Chen Cheng, National
                        Government Commander, to strengthen his position vis-à-vis Provincial
                        Government. I believe we should avoid being responsible for any such
                        friction if possible and should leave matter as it stands without further
                        pressure until sufficient time has elapsed to disclose whether authorities
                        are taking effective action to deal with situation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: With reference to my telegram no. 2026 of
                        October 27, 4 p.m., and previous telegrams, regarding the attack by Chinese
                        bandits on an American Army motor convoy near Iliang, Yunnan, and the
                        wounding of several U.S. Army officers, I have the honor to enclose copy of
                        despatch no. 135 of October 29th, from the Consul at Kunming, Yunnan, to the
                        Embassy, and a copy of the Embassy’s instruction of this date to the
                            Consul.<note n="11" xml:id="d651fn11">Latter not printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Following the receipt at Chungking of the Consul’s telegraphic report on this
                        incident, I called on Dr. T. V. Soong, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and
                        brought the matter to his serious attention, at the same time suggesting
                        that it should be reported to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. I have since
                        been informed orally from the Foreign Minister that the incident was
                        reported to Generalissimo Chiang and that strong instructions regarding the
                        matter were issued by the National Government to the Yunnan authorities.</p>
                    <p>I have instructed the Consul at Kunming to continue to follow this case with
                        the Yunnan provincial government and if information is not soon forthcoming
                        on the investigation and action ordered by Chairman Lung Yun, that he should
                        press firmly but courteously for such information as at the instance and
                        under instructions of the Embassy, for report to the American
                        Government.</p>

                            Foreign Affairs at Kunming dated October 19, 1943 and his reply thereto
                            dated October 25, 1943.<note n="13" xml:id="d651fn13">Neither

                  </p>
                        <p>It is believed that the essential details of the incident are adequately
                            set forth in the enclosures to this despatch. The wounded American
                            personnel are still in hospital, but with the exception of Major <pb n="723" xml:id="pg_723" facs="0733"/>Pennoyer of the Army Medical
                            Corps, whose upper right arm was badly shattered by gunshot, the wounds
                            are not as serious as was thought at first.</p>
                        <p>There is no question but that the attack came as a complete surprise to
                            the Americans who had offered no provocation. The American party, in
                            charge of Colonel Hutchinson, was composed of additional officers, men,
                            and Chinese interpreters en route to join an American liaison and
                            instructional group already attached to the Chinese Ninth Army Group at
                            Wenshan. The American convoy of three trucks was halted by the
                            obstruction of the road by three Chinese civilian operated trucks.
                            Colonel Hutchinson, in charge of the American party, dismounted with the
                            intention of offering assistance in clearing the road, but it became
                            apparent immediately that the Chinese trucks were in the process of
                            being bandited by a group of armed Chinese. Several of the Chinese
                            approached the American trucks and demanded the surrender of firearms
                            and simultaneously opened fire, wounding Colonel Hutchinson, who, as he
                            fell, killed his immediate assailant and wounded another of the bandits.
                            The fight then became general. After approximately twenty minutes the
                            bandits were driven off and the Americans withdrew to Iliang with two
                            trucks, one having been disabled by gunfire.</p>
                        <p>The incident first came to my attention on the afternoon of October 16th,
                            but full details were not available until after the completion of an
                            American Army investigation carried out on October 17th. On October 18th
                            I called on the Special Delegate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
                            acquainted him with the details of the incident and the findings of the
                            American investigation, and insisted that the Provincial Chairman be
                            informed immediately. The Special Delegate was in touch with Lung Yun
                            shortly thereafter by telephone and my official note and Colonel Dorn’s
                            letter, a copy of which is also enclosed,<note n="14" xml:id="d651fn14">Not printed.</note> were delivered to the Chairman by the office of
                            the Special Delegate on the following day. The Special Delegate
                            conferred with Lung Yun on the evening of October 20th and on October
                            21st called on me to acquaint me with the result of his conference with
                            the Chairman.</p>
                        <p>According to the Special Delegate the Chairman was deeply concerned over
                            the incident and had taken immediate steps to effect the apprehension of
                            the bandits and had sent a representative to the Post Hospital to make
                            inquiry as to the condition of the wounded American officers. The
                            Special Delegate stated that the magistrates of Iliang and Lunan had
                            been severely reprimanded and had been made responsible for an
                            investigation of the affair and the apprehension of the bandits, but
                            according to Lung Yun’s instructions, their efforts <pb n="724" xml:id="pg_724" facs="0734"/>in this connection were under the
                            personal supervision of the Commissioner of People’s Affairs, Li
                            Pei-t’ien. The Special Delegate considered this latter step as being
                            unusual and a reflection of the concern of the Chairman. The Special
                            Delegate was of the opinion that the magistrates concerned were being
                            continued in office in order that they could not avoid responsibility by
                            resignation and he is convinced that they will be punished in due
                            course, the weight of punishment to be contingent upon the effectiveness
                            of their actions in apprehending the culprits in the present
                            incident.</p>
                        <p>Immediately following its occurrence, the incident was reported to
                            General Stilwell<note n="15" xml:id="d651fn15">Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell,
                                Commanding General, United States Army Forces in China, Burma, and
                                India.</note> and to General Ch’en Ch’eng, commander-in-chief of the
                            Chinese Expeditionary Force, by Colonel Frank Dorn, deputy chief of
                            staff USAFCBI. Colonel Dorn was informed almost immediately by the
                            headquarters of General Ch’en that, inasmuch as the incident had
                            occurred in an area under the control of the Provincial Government,
                            there was nothing that the Expeditionary Force could do and it was
                            suggested orally by officers of General Ch’en’s staff that strong action
                            be taken against the Provincial Government.</p>
                        <p>It seemed to me to be apparent that Central Government officials here,
                            including General Ch’en, although regretting the wounding of American
                            personnel by a lawless Chinese element, were not averse to taking
                            advantage of the situation and any American pressure resulting
                            therefrom, further to undermine the position of Lung Yun in Yunnan.
                            Needless to say, Colonel Dorn was justifiably incensed at the occurrence
                            and in the beginning was prepared to reveal the story to American
                            newspapermen here and offer them facilities for its transmission abroad.
                            I suggested to him that the threat of publicity was an effective
                            instrument in dealing with the case and it was agreed between us that
                            for the time being, at least, no publicity would be given the affair by
                            Branch Headquarters. Since then Colonel Dorn has been acquainted with
                            the contents of the Embassy’s telegram no. 57, October 21, 5 p.m.<note n="16" xml:id="d651fn16">Not found in Department files.</note> and I
                            believe that General Stilwell has disapproved Colonel Dorn’s suggestion
                            of publicity pending final action on the case. In this connection the
                            Embassy will please find enclosed a paraphrase of a message received at
                            Branch Headquarters on October 26th from New Delhi.<note n="17" xml:id="d651fn17">Not printed.</note>
                  </p>
                        <p>As pointed out in my telegram no. 35, October 23, 1 p.m., the effect of
                            the incident on American military personnel here has been serious. There
                            has been prevalent for some time among American officers and enlisted
                            men a feeling that the Chinese, especially the Yunnanese, have been
                            doing little, if anything, to assist the war effort <pb n="725" xml:id="pg_725" facs="0735"/>and the attack on an American convoy,
                            regardless of the fact that it was unpremeditated, has given rise to an
                            unfortunate, but understandable, attitude of
                            shoot-first-talk-afterwards.</p>
                        <p>As time goes on and offensive preparations develop, American liaison
                            groups will be stationed at a variety of places in the province. Five
                            groups are already in the field and additional personnel proceeding to
                            reenforce these and the establishment of new groups will result in a
                            considerable and almost constant movement of American ground force
                            personnel. The movement of such personnel will be in accord with the
                            exigencies of the military situation or to meet the requests of Chinese
                            commanders in the field and the American military authorities deem it
                            impracticable to notify the Provincial authorities of such movements in
                            advance. They also feel that inasmuch as the liaison and instructional
                            program has the approval of the highest Central Government military
                            authorities there is no reason to notify local authorities of individual
                            movements which are a part of the program as a whole. I have informed
                            the Special Delegate orally of the attitude of the American military
                            authorities in this respect and at the same time informed him that I
                            would expect to receive a report of the Provincial Government’s
                            investigation of the incident and the results of any steps taken to
                            apprehend the bandits. I have also intimated to the Special Delegate
                            that the public announcement of drastic disciplinary action against the
                            two magistrates involved might well have a salutary effect upon other
                            local officials in whose domains there was a tendency toward laxity in
                            the maintenance of peace and order and would at the same time have the
                            effect of helping to convince American personnel that the incident was
                            an isolated one and not necessarily representative of a common state of
                            affairs against which elaborate defensive measures would be necessary
                            and in the course of which nervous trigger fingers could easily lead to
                            future unpleasantness.</p>
                        <p>I will take no further action unless so instructed by the Embassy.</p>

                    <p>208. An experienced American journalist, recently returned from a several
                        weeks’ trip to South China, in the course of which he made stops at Kweilin,
                        Changsha, Hengyang, and Kukong,<note n="2" xml:id="d654fn2">Chuchiang,
                            Shaokwan, or Shiuchow, on the Canton-Hankow Railway.</note> has made the
                        following observations to the Embassy in confidence: (1) Both American
                        missionaries and Chinese commented on the absence of American representation
                        and activity in the area, indicated the fact that the British were
                        relatively quite active. At Kweilin the British have four or five men,
                        including a consular officer and a military mission. At Changsha, the
                        British Red Cross have opened a hospital which now has about 100 patients
                        and will eventually accommodate 150 when full equipment arrives. Only
                        charity cases are accepted. Seven British doctors and 14 nurses with China
                        experience are on the staff. At Kukong there are among other[s], a British
                        naval observer, a Secretary of the British Embassy, and a British officer of
                        the Chinese Customs. Observer commented that these British representatives
                        were working to recover lost British prestige; that they were not, however,
                        being conspicuously successful; but that a greater evidence of American
                        activity in the area would serve a useful purpose.</p>

                    <p>301. Your 208, February 8, 1 p.m. In the light of the information contained
                        in your reference telegram, the Department would <pb n="728" xml:id="pg_728" facs="0738"/>appreciate receiving your opinion as to the advisability,
                        when personnel is available in China, of assigning two Chinese language
                        officers to the new Consulate at Kweilin, one officer to remain at Kweilin
                        and the other to be available for frequent visits to Kukong, Hengyang,
                        Changsha, Nanning, and perhaps other points in that general area. In this
                        connection, consideration might be given to the question of stationing one
                        officer more or less permanently at Kukong, provisional capital of Kwangtung
                        Province, and reportedly a good listening post for the general Canton-Hong
                        Kong area.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that you discuss with the military and naval attachés, as
                        well as with General Stilwell,<note n="3" xml:id="d655fn3">Gen. Joseph W.
                            Stilwell, Commanding General, United States Army Forces in China, Burma,
                            and India.</note> the question of having military and naval observers
                        stationed in or of their making periodic visits to the south China area.</p>
                    <p>The Department believes that it would be generally advantageous that we
                        maintain adequate official representation in the general area in question.
                        Furthermore, it would of course be most useful to have reliable and current
                        reports on developments in that part of China from which hitherto but little
                        information has been forthcoming.</p>

                    <p>372. The matter raised in Department’s 301, March 5, 8 p.m., has been
                        discussed with the Military and Naval Attachés who are both desirous of
                        increasing Embassy’s contact with South China area. Military Attaché is
                        sending one of his assistants on a trip to Yunnan–Indochina border from
                        whence he will travel to Kweilin and Kukong for general observation of
                        conditions in the area. Naval Attaché plans to send to Kukong an assistant
                        who will if practicable travel up to Foochow. He expects to keep one officer
                        more or less continuously in the coastal area.</p>
                    <p>General Stilwell is not in Chungking. I shall discuss the matter with him
                        soon but am sure that he will welcome increased Embassy representation in
                        the area.</p>
                    <p>It has been Embassy’s intention to assign two officers to Kweilin with
                        instructions that one of them should spend most of his time traveling in the
                        area. A language officer and Richard Service<note n="4" xml:id="d656fn4">Vice Consul at Kunming.</note> would be a good combination.</p>
                    <pb n="729" xml:id="pg_729" facs="0739"/>
                    <p>With regard to officers in the northwest it may develop that inasmuch as the
                        work within the cities where they are detailed in [<hi rend="italic">is</hi>] not exacting or voluminous one officer might divide his time
                        between Chengtu and Sian, traveling also to adjacent areas, and the consular
                        officer at Tihua might make periodic trips to Lanchow. This arrangement
                        suggests itself because of delayed arrival of officers assigned here. I plan
                        to send Clubb<note n="5" xml:id="d656fn5">O. Edmund Clubb, Second Secretary
                            of Embassy in China on detail at Lanchow.</note> on to Tihua soon and I
                        may send Drumright<note n="6" xml:id="d656fn6">Everett F. Drumright, Second
                            Secretary of Embassy in China and Consul at Kunming.</note> on to Sian
                        for a period.</p>
                    <p>On its staff in Chungking the Embassy needs two more officers experienced in
                        China, preferably with language training, in order to function effectively
                        (Commercial and Agricultural Attachés and staffs are excluded from this
                        calculation). When these officers now on assignment assume their duties this
                        need and needs in outlying places will be met and it is hoped therefore that
                        the Department will be able to arrange for their early arrival and arrival
                        also of a Consul General for Kunming.</p>

                            knowledge of Russian. Mr. Wu added that it would be most helpful to the
                            Chinese Government if our Government could see its way clear to

                    <p>1241. The Embassy has received a letter dated June 16, 1943 (a duplicate of
                        which addressed to the Secretary is being forwarded by pouch) from a
                        committee representing American residents of the Foochow district urgently
                        requesting that the Consulate be reopened there or at Nanping or some other
                        inland point. The writers point out that there are 90 Americans residing in
                        the district plus a number in the adjacent Amoy district who could be served
                        by the office; that the Foochow British Consulate is still being maintained;
                        that the new situations arising from the abolition of extraterritoriality
                        make[s] the advice and assistance of a consular officer most important; and
                        that communications with the rest of Free China are very poor (they state
                        for example that to make application for a passport and to receive a new one
                        takes about 3 months).</p>
                    <p>Among others the following considerations also occur to us: (1) Foochow, as
                        the only important Chinese port still in the hands of the Chinese, is a
                        center of information which should tend to increase in importance as times
                        goes on; (2) the Naval Attaché hopes to station an observer there and it is
                        probable that there will be other American or Allied military and civilian
                        activity in that area in future; (3) the Department is now maintaining
                        furnished quarters and office equipment at Foochow; and (4) the city is far
                        enough from the sea so that an officer stationed there would in all
                        probability have ample time to evacuate in case of Jap landing.</p>
                    <p>We accordingly recommend that the Consulate be reopened and suggest that a
                        China Service officer now serving outside China be assigned there and that
                        decision whether the Consulate should function in Foochow itself or at some
                        nearby place be withheld pending the officer’s arrival and making of
                        recommendations in the premises.</p>
                    <p>We suggest that if this proposal is approved, the Department select for the
                        assignment from the China officers now serving in other foreign countries
                        one who has not previously been stationed in Foochow and who may possibly
                        come to Free China with a fresh point of view. Alternatively, an additional
                        officer might be assigned to the Embassy, thus enabling the post to be
                        filled by detail of an officer from here.</p>

                    <p>New requests were for three journalism professors to teach in a school to be
                        established at Chungking by the Ministry; one feature writer to travel about
                        China gathering materials for use by foreign correspondents, and to train
                        about ten Chinese feature writers; and one radio commentator who would
                        advise the Ministry on materials to be broadcast.</p>
                    <p>On the basis of information available the Department was doubtful whether the
                        last two are of sufficient immediate value to justify the expense, but
                        considered the supplying of journalism teachers to be an outstanding
                        opportunity for service. Funds are available for the three teachers.</p>
                    <p>Tong was informed it would be necessary for the Department to receive a
                        formal invitation through the Foreign Office. He informed the Department
                        that he cabled December 30 regarding the new requests and stating that the
                            Generalissimo<note n="5" xml:id="d661fn5">Chiang Kai-shek, President of
                            the Chinese Executive Yuan (Premier).</note> desired Tong to establish a
                        new journalism school. A reply December 31 from Tseng Hsu-pai<note n="6" xml:id="d661fn6">Director, International Department, Chinese Ministry of
                            Information.</note> appeared to indicate that T. F. Tsiang<note n="7" xml:id="d661fn7">Director, Political Affairs Department, Chinese
                            Executive Yuan.</note> was following the usual procedure on these
                        requests and that Tsiang believed there was no question but that
                        confirmation would be forthcoming if the State Department were willing to
                        finance the added experts.</p>
                    <p>Tong assumed Tsiang would act upon information already sent. Chinese
                        officials here have received over fifty applications for the three possible
                        openings.</p>
                    <p>At your discretion please consult appropriate officials regarding formal

                    <p>On February 17, 1943 Mr. Yulin Hsi called on Mr. Hamilton and presented a
                        letter of introduction from Ambassador Gauss. The Ambassador stated that Mr.
                        Hsi, who for seven years was one of the Chinese members of the Shanghai
                        Municipal Council, was proceeding to the United States on behalf of the
                        Chinese Government to study municipal administration. Mr. Hamilton told Mr.
                        Hsi that he would be happy to assist him in any way possible and Mr.
                        Hamilton offered <pb n="734" xml:id="pg_734" facs="0744"/>a number of
                        suggestions as to persons who might give helpful suggestions.</p>
                    <p>Subsequently, Mr. Hsi, who had been introduced to Mr. Stanton by Mr.
                        Hamilton, informed Mr. Stanton that he was a member of the National Defense
                        Council of the National Government and that he had been “instructed by the
                        Generalissimo” to proceed to the United States to make a detailed study of
                        municipal administration in this country. Mr. Hsi said he planned to remain
                        in Washington for two weeks and then to visit New York and other important
                        cities in this country. He said he anticipated that this itinerary would
                        take about three months and that he would then return to Washington to
                        organize the material which he had acquired and would probably return to
                        Chungking in about six months time. However, in this connection he added
                        that Dr. T. V. Soong<note n="9" xml:id="d662fn9">Chinese Minister for
                            Foreign Affairs.</note> had told him when he called on him last Friday,
                        February 26, that Dr. Soong thought Mr. Hsi should remain in the United
                        States for a longer period in order to make a complete and exhaustive study
                        of municipal administration.</p>
                    <p>According to Mr. Hsi, his first week in Washington was spent in the Library
                        of Congress where he consulted books and publications of municipal
                        administration and numerous reports from various municipalities in this
                        country. Mr. Stanton arranged for Mr. Hsi to call on the commissioners of
                        the District of Columbia Government and Mr. Hsi spent an entire week with
                        the commissioners and the heads of various departments. He stated that he
                        had learned much from his pleasant contacts with these officials.</p>
                    <p>It was gathered during the course of the conversation with Mr. Hsi that, upon
                        his return to Chungking, he expects to have considerable to do with the
                        drawing up of a new Municipal Charter for the city of Shanghai. Mr. Hsi is
                        also interested in the problem of price control and hopes to have time to
                        make at least a limited study of our price control measures in as much as
                        the Generalissimo asked him to look into this matter while he was in this
                        country.</p>

                    <p>The Department has reason to suppose that one purpose behind the sending of
                        these leading intellectuals to the United States is to promote contacts
                        between them and leaders in various lines of activity in the United States,
                        in order that the Chinese Government may obtain direct and reliable
                        information concerning all shades of opinion in the United States with
                        reference to questions in which China’s interests are involved. Such
                        questions would include, for example, participation by the United States in
                        a system of international organization after the war. The apparent desire is
                        to bring about personal contacts especially with American leaders who might
                        be thought to be antagonistic to international collaboration, including
                        collaboration <pb n="737" xml:id="pg_737" facs="0747"/>with China. Whether
                        the objective is merely one of acquiring accurate information concerning
                        prevalent American views in regard to international affairs, or includes the
                        influencing of such views in a way favorable to cooperation between the
                        United States and China is uncertain at this time.</p>
                    <p>An offer was conveyed informally by an officer of the Department to Dr. T. V.
                        Soong, before the arrival of the delegation to place at his disposal the
                        good offices of the appropriate officers of the Department, to make the
                        visit of these intellectuals pleasant and profitable. In particular, an
                        offer was made to inform learned societies in the United States of the
                        impending arrival of these persons, so that contacts could be readily
                        established. However, Dr. Soong requested that no publicity be given to this
                        project until the delegation had arrived and a preliminary survey has been
                        made.</p>
                    <p>In the confidential conversation already referred to Dr. Soong was assured
                        that the coming of these intellectual leaders to the United States could not
                        but make a favorable impression and would be regarded as giving a desirable
                        character of reciprocity to the program of cultural relations with China
                        that had been initiated by this Government.</p>

                    <p>The Secretary of State acknowledges the receipt of the Embassy’s despatch no.
                        989, of March 9, 1943, transmitting a memorandum<note n="15" xml:id="d667fn15">Neither printed.</note> on the situation in China from
                        the outbreak of the Pacific War. On page 10 of the memorandum is a
                        recommendation that the Department give attention to a program of selecting
                        Chinese young men with engineering and mechanical experience and of placing
                        them in industrial establishments in the United States for training.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy is, of course, aware that large numbers of Chinese students are
                        already in the United States, of whom many are now gaining practical
                        experience in all kinds of capacities from apprentice mechanics to
                        instructors in university faculties. There is a constant shifting of young
                        people from academic study to remunerative work and to some extent in the
                        reverse direction. There are also many dividing their time between study and
                        earning their living, some being primarily students and others primarily
                        workers. As a result the preparation of statistics is extremely
                        difficult.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Since these figures were published the number of students
                        receiving grants from the Department of State has increased to 207.</p>
                    <p>As of November 30, 1942, the Institute had listed 1,037 Chinese students in
                        the United States. The actual number having some claim to that
                        classification is probably nearer 2,000. A directory of “Chinese University
                        Graduates and Students in America, 1943” published by the Institute this
                        spring contains 1,214 names. Of these 267 were reported as in training or
                        employed. Probably the number of students employed is actually much larger.
                        Recently there have been more openings for employment of engineering
                        students than there were applicants for such posts.</p>
                    <p>It would appear, therefore, that quantitatively the American effort in
                        preparing young Chinese to play a part in modern life is still very
                        important. It is of special interest that there have been as many as fifteen
                        British Indemnity students transferred to this country, because during the
                        war they could not advantageously continue their studies in Britain.</p>
                    <p>In the Embassy’s memorandum in reference there is mention of the British
                        program for sending 81 Chinese technicians to Great Britain for training in
                        industrial establishments and in the Embassy’s despatch no. 1027 of March
                        24, 1943,<note n="16" xml:id="d667fn16">Not printed.</note> reference is
                        made to a group of 81 “Chinese students, professors, and apprentices”
                        selected for training in England. However, the Chinese Information Committee
                        Bulletin enclosed with the latter despatch states the number as 31 instead
                        of 81. It would be of interest to know which of these figures is
                        correct.</p>
                    <p>The Bulletin referred to goes on to describe how the expense of one
                        fellowship and nine scholarships was divided between the British Government
                        and the Chinese Ministry of Education.</p>
                    <pb n="739" xml:id="pg_739" facs="0749"/>
                    <p>In the case of grants made by the Department to Chinese students and
                        professors, no attempt has been made to utilize credits already granted to
                        China, nor to invite financial cooperation by the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>It seems possible that there would be some advantage in some such plan of
                        joint contributions in the scholarship program as the British have
                        inaugurated. However, it does not appear desirable to begin any such formal
                        cooperation between the two Governments with respect to the students now in
                        this country. The immediate need is for relief of students left stranded and
                        the utilization of their time to the best advantage for their professional
                        development. The financial burden is actually being divided between the
                        Department of State and the Committee on Wartime Planning, a Chinese
                        Government agency, both of which utilize to a greater or less extent the
                        information and facilities of the China Institute in America and thus avoid
                        serious overlapping.</p>
                    <p>It has been suggested that if and when the Department shall have funds
                        available for the bringing of Chinese technical personnel to this country
                        for further training the following method might be adopted: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>Determine a few fields in which cooperation is proposed, such as
                                agriculture, engineering or public health.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>Send a representative of the Division to acquaint himself with the
                                principal Chinese governmental institutions in the field or fields
                                selected, with the leaders in those fields, and with the younger
                                personnel.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Consult with the head of a selected institution as to whether
                                there is on his staff some young man of exceptional promise who
                                would profit by a period of study in the United States. Actually
                                this might best be done after the representative of the Department
                                had formed some opinion of his own as to the most promising
                                candidate and could tactfully but unofficially influence the
                                selection.</item>

                                his absence from the country; (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) payment of
                                travelling expenses within China (between his home and the Asiatic
                                port of embarkation); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) agreement with the
                                fellowship holder as to the position which he would hold on his
                                return to China.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Finally a formal recommendation from the Chinese Government of one
                                or more of the individuals already informally agreed upon.</item>
                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>It has been represented that there would be certain advantages in such a
                        system. Only those would be brought to the United States who had proved
                        their ability in actual work in China; the fact that the Chinese Government
                        was sharing in the expense, and would employ the scholarship holder on his
                        return, would help to give assurance that he was considered a really useful
                        worker; there would be the element of cooperation which the Embassy noted in
                        the British plan.</p>
                    <pb n="740" xml:id="pg_740" facs="0750"/>
                    <p>This system has given good results when tried by private organizations. The
                        Department would be interested to learn whether the Embassy believes some
                        such plan would be feasible and wise for the Department to follow. If the
                        Embassy is favorably disposed, consideration may be given to the
                        advisability of including provision for fellowships of this type in some
                        future budget.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it would be of interest to consider whether it would be wise
                        to ask the Chinese Government to reciprocate by making available some of its
                        experts for service in American institutions. As the Embassy will have noted
                        from the Department’s telegram of May 3, 1943,<note n="17" xml:id="d667fn17">Not printed.</note> the Harvard-Yenching Institute is inviting a
                        Chinese philologist, Mr. S. S. Ting of Academia Sinica, to come to this
                        country to work on a project of that Institute. Such invitations might come
                        from several institutions if the Chinese Government were disposed to
                        cooperate.</p>

                            Chungking for a special Cultural Relations officer, preferably a senior
                            Foreign Service officer, but if such an officer is not available, for an
                            Auxiliary Foreign Service officer. A Foreign Service officer would be
                            preferred for this position, because his knowledge of State Department
                            usage and procedures would make the Department’s relations with the
                            cultural relations program in China run more smoothly and with less risk
                            of unexpected occurrences, than would be the case if a man lacking this
                            background were appointed to the post. The Chief of Mission would
                            undoubtedly be able to delegate duties to an experienced Foreign Service
                            officer with greater confidence than he would feel in the case of a man

                            or have left the United States, and five more are now being appointed.
                            These <pb n="741" xml:id="pg_741" facs="0751"/>men, in order to set to
                            work immediately on arrival, should be introduced by the Embassy to a
                            number of Chinese Government offices and certain information should be
                            gathered by the Embassy in advance of the arrival of each expert. Dr.
                            Ralph Phillips, animal breeding specialist recently wrote in a personal
                            letter to RC: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                <p>“One of the obvious needs, here, is for a man on the Embassy
                                    staff whose primary and only interest is the Cultural Relations
                                    program. If the program is to work effectively there should be
                                    someone who can see that the specialists are properly introduced
                                    to the Chinese workers and the field of work, and also to see
                                    that the needs of the specialists are met, in so far as that is
                                    possible under present conditions. At present there is no one at
                                    the Embassy who has either the time or the interest to give the
                                    experts more than passing notice, and we are obviously not
                                    considered a part of the Embassy organization. Even such minor
                                    items as stationery become major problems out here. Another very
                                    useful function that a staff member could perform is supplying
                                    information on what is really needed out here. In my case, for
                                    example, such a man could have spent two or three days with the
                                    Ministry of Agriculture officials and then advised you of the
                                    type of organization and the facilities available, and also the
                                    specific kinds of help and information that were needed. This
                                    information could have been obtained quite easily, and if it had
                                    been available I would have been in much better position to do
                                    the job here. As the number of specialists increases, the need
                                    for such a man will become more acute.”</p>

                            Relations is completing the Chinese soundtracks for about thirty reels
                            of motion pictures and is producing about seven reels of new films for
                            China. This work represents an investment of about $20,000. An
                            additional 70 pictures are planned for the 1944 fiscal year. When the
                            prints of the present pictures, numbering about 150, are shipped to
                            China, it is essential that an officer of the Embassy should supervise
                            distribution. These films are all 16 mm. and cannot be shown in
                            commercial theaters. They are intended for schools, clubs, and
                            Government offices. In South American capitals some Cultural Relations
                            officers have achieved a total attendance of 250,000 persons a month for
                            American non-theatrical picture shows. Only two or three projectors are
                            used in each Latin American country. In China there are at least a dozen
                            projectors available. The Embassy has already stated that motion
                            pictures can serve as a very useful form of influence.</item>

                                societies and agricultural bodies are already extending assistance
                                to corresponding groups in the other American republics, in

                                except for the occasional use of the pouch. RC believes that this
                                building of a community of interest by the Chinese and American
                                doctors, scientists, and engineers will reinforce the past benefits
                                of American education acquired by Chinese, and will serve to
                                counteract the tendency of some Chinese toward an isolationist
                                attitude.</item>

                    <p>807. Funds have been requested and may possibly be available July 1 for
                        sending 3 American professors to China for 1 year. The Department is
                        tentatively considering the appointment of George Cressey, professor of
                        geography at Syracuse University, to fill the first position. His assignment
                        would differ from that of his two colleagues. He would be expected to act as
                        field representative of the Division of Cultural Relations to make the
                        program more effective among educational groups; and to recommend to the
                        Department measures for the improvement and the development of the program.
                        He might be asked to cooperate with Needham<note n="21" xml:id="d669fn21">Joseph Needham, member of British Cultural and Scientific Mission to
                            China.</note> in aiding Chinese scientists.</p>
                    <p>Cressey’s effectiveness would depend largely upon the welcome that would be
                        accorded to him in Chinese official and educational circles. The Embassy is

                            August 21, 1943.</note> brought me from Chungking the attached letter
                        (with enclosures)<note n="23" xml:id="d670fn23">None printed.</note> from
                        Tseng Yang-fu, Minister of Communications, who is developing a plan for the
                        technical training in the United States of a number of Chinese engineers and
                        foremen for China’s post-war reconstruction program.</p>
                    <p>Tseng Yang-fu, who is very much of a live-wire and at the same time rather an
                        astute politician, spoke to me of this matter some time before I left
                        Chungking. I expressed keen interest in the project and suggested that he
                        work out his proposals and then discuss them with me and with Dr. Victor
                        Hoo, Administrative Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was present as a
                        guest at my tiffin party for Tseng.</p>
                    <p>At this conversation, I managed to make a casual inquiry as to how Tseng’s
                        plan was to be financed. He stated then that he proposed that it be financed
                        by the Chinese Government; but examination of the proposals made in the
                        attached letter shows that he now proposes that the scheme be financed by
                        American industry; that is, the engineers and foremen are to bear the cost
                        from their “wage compensation”. I do not believe he has reference to their
                        wage compensation in China; it would not be adequate for any such
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>I believe that Tseng’s proposals should have careful study with a view, if
                        possible, to some arrangement whereby we can offer this technical training
                        in the United States for Chinese engineers and leading hands. If we do not
                        take them in the United States, the Chinese will look elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The problem involves not only the cooperation of American industry, but the
                        question of finance; and also the question of immigration regulations and
                        the attitude of American labor unions. It is perhaps unfortunate that this
                        question comes up just at a time when Chinese immigration restrictions<note n="24" xml:id="d670fn24">For correspondence regarding repeal of Chinese

                        to the fore in the United States, but we should have to face this problem
                        sooner or later.</p>
                    <pb n="744" xml:id="pg_744" facs="0754"/>
                    <p>As I do not expect to be in Washington for another month, it seems desirable
                        that I send Tseng’s letter on to the Department so that the matter may be
                        studied in advance of my arrival there, and so that I may be able to take
                        back some word to Tseng when (and if) I return to Chungking.</p>
                    <p>I should add this: Tseng’s letter does not indicate that his plan has
                        approval of the National Government; and he puts his proposals forward with
                        a request for “comment and suggestion”. This is typical of Tseng; he is not
                        inclined to proceed “through channels”, and he seeks to put matters through
                        by himself. I had hoped that when he had formulated his ideas he would
                        discuss them with the Foreign Office (and the Executive Yuan) and the
                        proposals made to us would have National Government blessing. I commented to
                        Tseng that I had noticed from our passport reports that Dr. Wong Wen-hao,
                        the Minister of Economics, was from time to time sending some of his men, as
                        government officials, to the United States, for special training in American
                        plants. It was my intention to look into this matter “diplomatically” and
                        see just what Dr. Wong had worked out. I am inclined to believe that his men
                        (I recall that they came principally from the National Resources Commission,
                        which is part of the Ministry of Economics) have been “placed” in the United
                        States through T. V. Soong and China Defense Supplies.</p>
                    <p>I feel that we should give all possible support to Tseng’s project, but I
                        doubt whether American industry is going to be willing to finance it, and I
                        would prefer to avoid the difficulty regarding immigration regulations and
                        our American labor unions by having these people come under Government
                        status, without “compensation” from industry. It would of course be an
                        expensive measure if we had to finance it (say $1,000,000 a year if each
                        person were allowed $2000).</p>
                    <p>However, the problem should be studied, and I am therefore sending it on to
                        you in advance of my return to Washington.</p>
                    <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>

                    <p>A–19. According to recent Chinese press reports which have been confirmed by
                        Chinese officials a plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the
                        Ministry of Education for sending one thousand Chinese students each year
                        for the next five years to the United States and Great Britain. Informed
                        sources state that 700 students will be <pb n="745" xml:id="pg_745" facs="0755"/>sent to the United States and 300 to Great Britain each
                        year under this plan. Of this number 500 are to be chosen by examination and
                        500 are to be appointed by institutions, with the approval of the Ministry
                        of Education. Those appointed are generally to be older persons up to the
                        age of 40 and will include professors, who must have engaged in study within
                        the previous 15 years, and government officials. Students to be eligible for
                        examination must have graduated from college within two years previously or
                        must be among the first three in recent graduating classes. Government
                        officials will be drawn from the Ministries of Economic Affairs,
                        Communications and Agriculture and Forestry and from the National Health
                        Administration. Women will be eligible for examination and appointment. All
                        expenses will be paid by the Chinese Government and students are to be sent
                        for two-year periods, subject to extension.</p>
                    <p>The project has arisen from the lack of trained technical personnel in China
                        and the anticipated needs for the post-war reconstruction program. An
                        informed Chinese states that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, the
                        Chinese Government adopted a policy of discouraging the sending of students
                        and technicians abroad on the ground that their services were needed in
                        China. It subsequently developed that through the deterioration of Chinese
                        university standards during wartime the caliber of Chinese graduates was
                        lowered and trained technical personnel became inadequate.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wang Shih-chieh, Secretary General of the People’s Political Council and
                        of the State Planning Board, is reliably reported as having urged that 30
                        per cent of the students to be sent abroad under the plan should be in the
                        social sciences but a member of the Executive Yuan states that approximately
                        80 per cent of the students will be in technical fields.</p>
                    <p>A qualified foreign observer views the insistence upon such a large number of
                        technical students as a bid by the CC clique for a share in the Chinese
                        post-war industrialization and technological development. This observer
                        feels that the National Resources Commission and the Ordnance Department
                        include most of the technical skill needed for Chinese industrialization;
                        that the weakness of the CC leaders has lain partly in their lack of
                        technicians capable of building a new China; and that this program
                        represents their effort to achieve a dominant position in post-war
                        development. An informed Chinese source takes a similar view but feels that
                        the Chung Hsueh Hsi group (so-called Political Science group) has too strong
                        a hold in the technical field through Dr. Wong Wen-hao, the National
                        Resources Commission and industrial plants under his control to lose its
                        leading place in the economic development of China. While Tseng Yang-fu,
                        Minister of Communications, is a member of the CC group, <pb n="746" xml:id="pg_746" facs="0756"/>the technicians of his Ministry are said by
                        this Chinese to be followers of Dr. Wong.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy feels that this plan which is expected to receive the approval of
                        the Executive Yuan offers an opportunity to the Division of Cultural
                        Relations to accomplish an effective extension of its cultural relations
                        program for China. Plans could be made to bring to the appointees an
                        appreciation of the American way of life and a personal interest could be
                        taken in them which would make their stay in the United States more than a
                        pure study of technical subjects. Only a small number of students may be
                        expected to be sent this year, full effectuation of the program to be
                        achieved in 1944.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: There is enclosed a copy of a memorandum<note n="25" xml:id="d672fn25">Not printed.</note> prepared by Dr. John K.
                        Fairbank, a former member of the faculty of Harvard University and the
                        Chungking representative of the Inter-Departmental Committee for the
                        Acquisition of Foreign Publications, on the subject of the organization and
                        present condition of the Central Political Institute. The memorandum may be
                        summarized as follows:</p>
                    <p>The Central Political Institute, which is situated about 10 miles south of
                        Chungking, is under the direct control of the Kuomintang, and graduates
                        enter the government service without further examination. The Institute has
                        a present enrolment of approximately 1500 students and is divided into the
                        three following divisions: 1) The College, which offers courses in Politics
                        and Law, Economics, and Diplomacy; 2) The Civil Service Division, whose
                        graduates are guaranteed government posts in the civil service by law and
                        thus have a more secure legal status than the graduates of the College whose
                        government posts are guaranteed only by the Kuomintang; 3) The Technical
                        Division, which is divided into the four sections of journalism, Asiatic
                        languages, land administration, and statistics. It is reported that the
                        annual budget of the Institute is CNC $15 million, while the Academia Sinica
                        and the National Southwest Associated University in Kunming (the leading
                        educational institution in China) receive in the neighborhood of only CNC $2
                        million each.</p>
                    <p>Students may enter the Institute either by competitive examinations or by
                        recommendation by the provincial commissioners of education <pb n="747" xml:id="pg_747" facs="0757"/>and are provided without charge food,
                        lodging, uniforms and spending money. The faculty is composed of about 50
                        persons and is headed by General Chiang Kai-shek in the capacity of
                        Chancellor of the Institute. Close relations with the Generalissimo’s
                        headquarters are indicated by the fact that the section of the Headquarters
                        which deals with personnel and is headed by Mr. Chen Kuo-fu, one of the two
                        leaders of the reactionary C–C clique, is located at the Institute, so that
                        Mr. Chen is in intimate touch with the personnel passing through the
                        Institute.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Fairbank is of the opinion that the background of the group of faculty
                        members whom he met on a recent visit to the Institute was decidedly
                        continental European, and he states that they acknowledged that “continental
                        administrative systems seemed to hold more for a country like China than the
                        Anglo-Saxon systems”. The Vice-Chancellor of the Institute, Dr. Ch’eng
                        T’ien-fang, nevertheless expressed much interest in post-war educational
                        relations with the United States, and the Institute appeared to be desirous
                        of sending men to the United States for training in administrative
                        interneeships. Although the Institute does not appear to Dr. Fairbank to be
                        staffed by men of great ability, he feels that it is in a key position and
                        is not necessarily hostile to the United States.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Fairbank feels that a preference for continental rather than Anglo-Saxon
                        administrative systems is understandable in those who may be interested in
                        building up a widespread bureaucracy under centralized control. The
                        Institute may, therefore, be viewed as one more aspect of the efforts of the
                        Kuomintang leaders to extend their control over all phases of activity in
                            China.<note n="26" xml:id="d672fn26">In a memorandum dated September 24
                            to the Division of Cultural Relations the Assistant Chief of the
                            Division of Far Eastern Affairs (Vincent) stated: “Mr. Fairbank’s
                            memorandum transmitted by Chungking’s despatch no. 1416 of August 2,
                            1943 is especially interesting. The Central Political Institute, of
                            which he writes, and the Central Training Corps in Chungking where
                            officials of the Government undergo a rigorous training in Kuomintang
                            precepts, form the basis of a system of party control in the future
                            which does not augur well for the development of democratic methods.”
                            Mr. Vincent took the occasion to make reference to “the matter of the
                            assignment of an attaché to Chungking to handle cultural or educational
                            relations” and to urge that “Mr. Fairbank would be an excellent
                            choice.”</note>

                            letter<note n="27" xml:id="d673fn27">Not printed.</note> written to the
                        Ambassador on May 14, 1943 by Mr. Tseng Yang-fu, Chinese Minister of
                        Communications, elaborating a plan for the sending of five hundred
                        technicians annually for training in the United States. The Ambassador will
                        recall that Mr. Tseng stated that he had written to the Vice President<note n="28" xml:id="d673fn28">Henry A. Wallace.</note> and to the Secretary
                        of Labor,<note n="29" xml:id="d673fn29">Frances Perkins.</note> likewise,
                        “to canvass their support”, and that the whole subject was discussed with
                        the Ambassador by officers of the Department.</p>
                    <p>The Department is informed that replies have been, or will be, sent by the
                        Vice President and the Secretary of Labor, informing Mr. Tseng of their
                        general approbation of his plan.</p>
                    <p>Since the date on which this matter first came to the Department, additional
                        information regarding the desire of the Chinese Government to train
                        technicians in the United States has been received. Particular reference may
                        be made to the Embassy’s airgram no. A–19, of July 22, 12 noon, concerning a
                        plan submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Education for
                        sending seven hundred technical students annually to the United States over
                        a five-year period.</p>
                    <p>The American Government would welcome the training in the United States of
                        Chinese technicians for service in China in the period of reconstruction
                        after the war, and would afford all such assistance in connection therewith
                        as might be desired and might be possible and appropriate. The Embassy is
                        authorized to inform the Chinese Government of the attitude of the American
                        Government in this connection at such time and in such manner as the
                        Ambassador deems advisable.</p>
                    <p>In addition to large scale plans for the training of Chinese technicians,
                        such as the two specifically mentioned in this instruction, there are in
                        prospect, or in actual execution, plans on a small scale for the training of
                        Chinese in the United States in the various technical fields of
                        communications and industry. It is probable that the administration of these
                        various projects will be systematized under some over-all plan.</p>
                    <p>In view of the circumstances, therefore, the Department believes that it
                        would not be advisable to assume that the plan set forth in Mr. Tseng’s
                        letter of May 14, 1943, is in its final form, nor to attempt any definite
                        measures for its execution as it stands. If the Ambassador should have
                        occasion to discuss this project further with Mr. Tseng, the Department
                        suggests that he inform Mr. Tseng concerning the attitude of the American
                        Government as described in the fourth <pb n="749" xml:id="pg_749" facs="0759"/>paragraph of this instruction, and inquire whether the
                        Chinese Government has in mind a comprehensive plan for the training of
                        Chinese technicians in the United States that would include technicians in
                        other fields, as well as communications.</p>

                    <p>A–87. Embassy’s A–19, July 22, 12 noon. Investigations made by the Department
                        disclose that seven agencies of the Chinese Government have formulated plans
                        for the training of technicians in the United States. These plans are in
                        various stages of realization. The Department, the Lend-Lease Administration
                        and other agencies of this Government that have been appealed to for
                        assistance or approval have been very cooperative. T. V. Soong as Director
                        of China Defense Supplies has set up a committee to serve as a sort of
                        clearing house for these various projects. In this Government the
                        Department’s Division of Cultural Relations is acting in this capacity. So
                        far as present training plans have prospects of successful execution, there
                        would seem to be no reason to alter them. In general they are part of the
                        war effort.</p>
                    <p>The new training program seems to the Department calculated to bring
                        substantial benefit to China and the United States and to their relations
                        with each other provided adequate preparations are made in advance. For
                        example, it seems desirable to provide for this project a supervisory agency
                        in the United States staffed by competent Chinese officials and with perhaps
                        one experienced American personnel specialist as consultant. Such an agency
                        would be essential to keep records and provide contact with Government and
                        private organizations in relation to the fourteen hundred trainees who would
                        be present in the United States at any one time. A rough estimate of the
                        probable cost of the project would be for each of the thirty-five hundred
                        men, transportation to and from the United States $2,000, transportation in
                        the United States $200, initial equipment $250, subsistence in the United
                        States $2,400, and for a supervisory office at $75,000 per annum for six
                        years, $450,000, giving a total of over seventeen million dollars. Providing
                        for unexpected expenditures and possible expansion, a tentative total
                        estimate would be twenty million dollars over a period of six years. It may
                        be the intention of the Chinese Government to appropriate annually the funds
                        necessary to conduct the enterprise, but the Government might prefer to
                        allocate the entire sum in advance. The Department has received a letter
                        from the <pb n="750" xml:id="pg_750" facs="0760"/>Secretary of the
                            Treasury<note n="30" xml:id="d674fn30">Henry Morgenthau, Jr.</note>
                        stating that the Treasury Department would agree to a request from the
                        Chinese Ministry of Finance if such a request were made that the sum of
                        twenty million dollars be earmarked from the five hundred million dollars
                        financial aid allotted to China by the agreement of March 21, 1942<note n="31" xml:id="d674fn31">Financial aid agreement, signed at Washington,
                            March 21, 1942, Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                            March 28, 1942, p. 263.</note> which provides in part that the credit
                        shall be used to “effect further social and economic measures which promote
                        the welfare of the Chinese people”.</p>
                    <p>While the Department wishes to extend every appropriate assistance to the
                        Chinese Government in carrying out the plan set forth in the Embassy’s A–19,
                        it would prefer that the execution of the plan should rest upon the
                        initiative of the Chinese Government and its agencies in China and the
                        United States. The Chinese might be sensitive, for example, in regard to any
                        seeming dictation in the use of their credit. The Department suggests that
                        the best approach would be for the Embassy to convey informally to an
                        official of the Executive Yuan the information that this Government would
                        welcome official notification concerning this plan the existence of which
                        has been published through the press and would be glad to respond to the
                        notification with an offer of assistance. The two suggestions concerning a
                        supervisory agency and the possible utilization of credits may be conveyed
                        in any way the Embassy regards as most tactful.</p>

                    <p>A–69. Reference Embassy’s A–19, July 22, 12 noon. Plans for sending a large
                        number of students to the United States and England have reportedly now been
                        almost completed, although not yet officially announced, and provide for
                        twelve hundred students of technological or managerial subjects. (Original
                        plan called for approximately ten percent to study social sciences or
                        humanities.) Eight hundred are to be sent to the United States and 400 to
                        Great Britain, the majority to remain for two years. Selections are to be
                        made by the Ministries of Education, Communications and Economic Affairs in
                        numbers of 700, 300 and 200 students, respectively, approximately ten
                        percent to be appointed by concerned ministries and the remainder selected
                        by competitive examination. All are to receive a period of political
                        indoctrination (presumably in the Central Training Corps) before <pb n="751" xml:id="pg_751" facs="0761"/>going abroad and those concerned with
                        industries will spend some time in industrial plants.</p>
                    <p>A qualified foreign observer comments that the complete exclusion of students
                        in fields other than technical and managerial and the insistence upon
                        placing Chinese students in the West almost entirely on a technological
                        level fit into two patterns: (1) the century-old doctrine of “Western
                        studies for use, Chinese studies as the base”, which is reflected in <hi rend="italic">China’s Destiny</hi>,<note n="32" xml:id="d675fn32">The
                            title of a book written by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</note> and (2)
                        the practice of totalitarian powers to use education for technology and
                        technology for the service of the state. This observer raised the question
                        with an official of the Executive Yuan of a more balanced program which
                        would train a few Chinese students in the ideas, arts, letters and social
                        studies of the West, and he received the answer that the direct offer by
                        American universities of their own scholarships for study in the United
                        States to the Chinese academic public by competitive examination (written
                        and oral), without reference to the Ministry of Education, would be entirely
                        feasible.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that the Department may wish to consider the advisability of
                        having the Cultural Relations Division take up informally with leading
                        American universities the question of scholarships of this type.</p>

                            when invited to do so, to give lectures and attend conferences. The
                            lectures will include those on general intellectual developments in the
                            United States and those of a professional character on Dr. Cressey’s
                            special field, geology and geography. In his lectures and

                            intellectual integrity, and on the wide dissemination and application of

                            educators and students. It will probably prove advantageous to <pb n="752" xml:id="pg_752" facs="0762"/>visit educational centers for a

                            to the Academia Sinica, and he should establish close relations with the

                            etc. At the same time, his relations with the Academia Sinica should not
                            be so close as to place him in a position of partisanship in respect to
                            any difference between the Academia Sinica and the Ministry of
                            Education.</item>

                        <item>The objectives of the cultural relations program were discussed and it
                            was recognized that Dr. Cressey’s relations in China would fall into two
                            general categories, firstly, relations with the Ministry of Education
                            and with other branches of the Chinese Government as the political
                            agency of the country, and secondly, with educational and strictly
                            cultural institutions. These relations should, when possible, be made to
                            serve the object of strengthening a disposition toward democratic ways
                            of thinking where it exists and of persuading toward such ways of
                            thinking those agencies and individuals who may be thinking in another
                            direction. It is hoped that the net result will be to strengthen the
                            universities and professors who believe in those educational and
                            international ideals in which we, as Americans, also believe.</item>
                        <label>4.</label>
                        <item>Since the cultural relations program is a program of service to China
                            as a whole, the smaller and more isolated institutions, which have few
                            foreign contacts, should be assisted as well as the leading schools. The
                            preparation of an itinerary must await Dr. Cressey’s arrival at
                            Chungking, but it may include travel as far east as Fukien or northwest
                            to Sinkiang.</item>
                        <label>5.</label>
                        <item>As a by-product of Dr. Cressey’s work, he should prepare a critical
                            evaluation of all Chinese universities in terms of faculty, equipment,
                            students, and needs; and likewise of scholars in several fields,
                            especially geology and geography.</item>
                        <label>6.</label>
                        <item>Since the cultural relations program involves reciprocity, one of its
                            objectives is to strengthen American scholarship in respect to the
                            Orient. While Dr. Cressey does not plan to engage in field work in his
                            own profession of geography and geology, he will nevertheless give his
                            attention to this field as opportunity offers, but only to the extent
                            that it does not result in interference with the cultural relations
                            program in general.</item>
                        <label>7.</label>
                        <item>The geographic and geologic interests of Dr. Cressey have led him
                                to study post-war economic planning for China and to a consideration
                                of the larger questions of geostrategy, sometimes called
                                geopolitics, in Asia, which have resulted in his forthcoming book
                                and in official studies made for the Office of the Geographer of the
                                Department <pb n="753" xml:id="pg_753" facs="0763"/>of State. These
                                studies deal with the distribution of people, land, agriculture,
                                minerals, and topography as they relate to plans for communications,
                                industry, and national welfare. His familiarity with Soviet
                                developments has point here.</item>
                        <label/>
                  <item>Since these questions have political implications, it is expected
                                that Dr. Cressey, in studying them and lecturing about them on
                                appropriate occasions will use great tact and will discuss his plans
                                with the American Embassy in advance. His status as a Visiting
                                Professor with respect to public statements is somewhat intermediate
                                between that of a University Professor with full academic freedom
                                and a Foreign Service Officer.</item>
                        <label>8.</label>
                        <item>Dr. Cressey will be away from Chungking for lengthy periods and it
                            will, therefore, be impossible for him to perform many administrative
                            duties. Nevertheless, it is requested that he constantly bear in mind
                            the present and prospective cultural relations program with China and
                            India and that he give his advice to the Division of Cultural Relations
                            in regard to the program; points in which his opinion and advice would
                            be useful would include the effectiveness of microfilm, exchange of
                            students and faculty members, the needs of universities, etc.</item>

                        Christian colleges and their importance in Sino-American cultural
                        relations.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary of Despatch</hi>. The cumulative effects of
                            unchecked inflation in China coupled with the ridiculously low exchange
                            rate for U. S. dollars have placed the twelve Christian colleges which
                            are actively functioning in free China in a precarious financial
                            condition, and if means are not found to alleviate the situation several
                            of these institutions may be forced to discontinue operations after the
                            close of the present scholastic year. While Christian colleges are
                            receiving approximately 35 times as much Chinese currency as they were
                            receiving in 1936–1937, this currency will purchase only 17 per cent of
                            the goods and services which were purchased before the war with their
                            greatly reduced incomes. Mr. Smith is of the opinion that any serious
                            curtailment of the work of the Christian colleges at this time would be
                            of direct concern to the American Government and he suggests that the
                            Division of Cultural Relations reexamine the possibility of utilizing
                                <pb n="754" xml:id="pg_754" facs="0764"/>these institutions to a
                            greater extent and consider whether some official action might be taken
                            to prevent the curtailment of their activities. If a more favorable
                            readjustment of the official exchange rate is not possible, he suggests
                            either direct aid through financial support of worthy projects of the
                            colleges or indirect aid through the inclusion of these institutions in
                            any reverse lend-lease arrangement that may be proposed.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary of Enclosures</hi>. Dr. P. H. Chang, Counsellor
                            of the Executive Yuan, stated that he had heard indirectly of a plan
                            proposed by the Central Planning Board for sending students to the
                            United States at Chinese Government expense but that the Executive Yuan
                            had no official information concerning it. He mentioned also that the
                            Ministries of Education and Economic Affairs were planning to allow
                            students to proceed to the United States at their own expense after
                            being examined by the Ministry of Education. Dr. Chang expressed
                            appreciation of the interest shown by the American Government and said
                            that he would call the suggestions with regard to financing such a plan
                            and the establishment of a supervisory agency to the attention of
                            interested officials.</p>
                        <p>The Chinese press on October 29 carried a list of regulations governing
                            students proceeding abroad for education at their own evpense, the
                            important points of which are as follows: (1) no students will in the
                            future be permitted to go abroad for study at their own expense without
                            prior sanction by the Ministry of Education; (2) a total of 600 students
                            will be given permission to study abroad and a provisional <pb n="757" xml:id="pg_757" facs="0767"/>ration has been established of 60% for
                            study in sciences and 40% in the arts; (3) examinations conducted by the
                            Ministry will consist of a written examination in the Three People’s
                            Principles, national history, geography, Chinese language, foreign
                            languages and the applicant’s special subject and an oral examination in
                            the candidate’s deportment and thinking; (4) all students who pass the
                            examinations shall undergo a period of intensive indoctrination at the
                            Central Training Corps; (5) reports will be submitted periodically by
                            the Superintendent of Students in the United States on their work, their
                            thinking and their deeds, which if found to be irregular may bring about
                            a student’s summary recall to China; and (6) on the student’s return to
                            China the Ministry of Education may assign him to an appropriate
                            position.</p>
                        <p>Press reports on November 5 stated that the first group of students to be
                            sent abroad at government expense will number 500 and that examinations
                            will be held in February 1944. However, a Central News Agency report on
                            November 10 stated that, as the project for sending students abroad at
                            government expense had not yet received approval, students would proceed
                            abroad this year only at their own expense. <hi rend="italic">End of

                    <p>Dr. Chang stated in a more recent conversation with an officer of the Embassy
                        that deliberations were being held on the question of sending students to
                        the United States at government expense and that the Embassy would shortly
                        be officially informed as to the results of these deliberations. He also
                        stated that it would not be a good policy to send too many students at first
                        and that probably not more than 1,000 students would be in the United States
                        at any one time, thus considerably reducing the expected expenditures as
                        estimated by the Department.</p>
                    <p>While the sending of students abroad for further study will undoubtedly bring
                        substantial benefit to China in its post-war reconstruction period, the
                        Embassy is of the opinion that, under such a rigorous system of selection
                        and control, students of known liberal political beliefs or those suspected
                        of a questioning or critical attitude toward the Kuomintang will find it
                        extremely difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the approval of the
                        Ministry of Education for study abroad. The provision in the enclosed
                        regulations for supervision of students in the United States and their
                        recall if found to be guilty of statements “contrary to the San Min Chu
                            I”<note n="37" xml:id="d679fn37">The “Three People’s Principles” of Sun
                            Yat-sen.</note> or of “irregular” deeds shows to what extent the
                        Kuomintang is prepared to carry its control over Chinese education. Almost
                        equally discouraging is the willingness of the Kuomintang leaders to make
                        public announcement of such fascist-like practices which are thus to be
                        effective beyond the borders of China.</p>
                    <p>It is noted that the provisional ratio of self-supporting students proceeding
                        abroad includes 40% in the arts (literature, law, commerce and education),
                        but it is believed that as long as the Ministry of <pb n="758" xml:id="pg_758" facs="0768"/>Education has complete control in the
                        selection of all such students the number of those proceeding abroad to
                        study other than scientific subjects will be negligible.</p>
                    <p>With reference to the suggestion advanced by the Embassy (Embassy’s A–69,
                        October 7, noon) that scholarships be offered by American universities
                        through competitive examinations to be held in China under capable impartial
                        auspices, it is believed such a procedure would still be feasible and might
                        serve to prevent the sending of only Kuomintang hand-picked personnel for
                        study in the United States.</p>

                    <p>A–120. The Department has been informed by some of the Chinese professors
                        visiting the United States in acceptance of the invitation set forth in the
                        Department’s telegram of October 13, 9 p.m. 1942<note n="38" xml:id="d680fn38">Telegram No. 953; <ref target="frus1942China#pg_724">

                        recruiting specially trained men for their teaching staffs. As an additional
                        measure of assistance to the six institutions in question the Embassy may
                        inform them that, if they desire to add to each of their respective staffs
                        one graduate student now in this country, the Department will be glad to
                        defray his travel expenses from the United States to the place in which the
                        University that has engaged his services is situated. The Department desires
                        that the visiting professors shall be fully authorized to select the
                        graduate students and to enter into employment contracts with them. For the
                        purposes of this offer National Southwest Associated University will be
                        entitled to one man for each of the component institutions thus raising the
                        possible total of graduate students appointed from six to eight. The
                        visiting professors indicate that if their institutions wish to empower them
                        to make selections and conclude contracts the following information will be
                        essential: nature of the instruction to be given by the appointee; type of
                        position and amount of salary and allowances offered; length of the
                        contract; and qualifications required of the candidate. The visiting
                        professors feel that this invitation should be brought to the attention of
                        the Ministry of Education even if it is not transmitted through the
                        Ministry. The Embassy is asked to exercise its judgment as to the manner of
                        transmitting this offer but should make it clear that transportation will be
                        by sea, except for the last stage, that the Department assumes no
                        responsibility in connection with risks incurred, and that <pb n="759" xml:id="pg_759" facs="0769"/>delays must be expected in obtaining
                        priorities for travel. For the Embassy’s information and use, if necessary,
                        it is the intention of the Department to grant each appointee $7 per diem
                        during his journey.</p>
                    <p>Replies from the Universities should be in English but supplementary
                        instructions to the visiting professors may be in Chinese. The Embassy is
                        authorized to transmit both replies and instructions to the Department by
                        pouch for forwarding to the addressees.</p>
                    <p>If the Embassy has suggestions to offer in regard to this proposal, they
                        should be made by telegraph.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: Upon departure from Chungking of Dr. John K.
                        Fairbank, a representative of the “Interdepartmental Committee” and of the
                        Office of Strategic Services also designated a Special Assistant of the
                        Embassy, I wish to submit an expression of the Embassy’s appreciation of Dr.
                        Fairbank’s assistance to the Department’s cultural relations program.</p>
                    <p>While Dr. Fairbank’s principal official function here is understood to have
                        been the procurement of enemy publications for IDC,<note n="39" xml:id="d681fn39">Interdepartmental Committee for the Acquisition of
                            Foreign Publications.</note> he has shown a wide and vigorous interest
                        in cultural relations matters. In an endeavor to assist him in the
                        procurement of enemy publications by furnishing him something in the nature
                        of a <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> to offer possible or prospective
                        sources for such publications, he has had supervision of the administration
                        of the Embassy microfilm program, and the success of that program has been
                        due largely to his efforts with it. In addition, he has assumed a number of
                        “extra-curricula” activities (which, although not enjoying a forthright
                        connection with the war effort, have had bearing on Sino-American cultural
                        relations in general) such as projects for rendering financial assistance to
                        Chinese professors and other matters tending to further Chinese reliance
                        upon American generosity and friendship. He also consulted frequently with
                        the cultural relations specialists sent by the Department for service with
                        the Chinese Government, and while his advice and counsel may not always have
                        conformed to settled usual Government standards, he was undoubtedly of
                        assistance and encouragement to some of them. In all of these activities Dr.
                        Fairbank exerted himself with such energy that he was generally regarded as
                        representing the Division of Cultural Relations of the Department rather
                        than OSS (or IDC). In the course of a speech by Dr. <pb n="760" xml:id="pg_760" facs="0770"/>Chu Chia-hua, at a tea party given to
                        welcome Dr. Cressey and to say farewell to Dr. Fairbank, the latter’s able
                        “representation” of the Cultural Relations Division was referred to in
                        complimentary terms and on the same occasion announcement was made that Dr.
                        Cressey has come to China as “representative of the Department of State” and
                        that Dr. Kates,<note n="40" xml:id="d681fn40">George N. Kates, Special
                            Assistant to the Embassy in China, representing the Interdepartmental

                        would act as Dr. Cressey’s “representative” when the latter should be absent
                        from Chungking. The question of Dr. Kates’ functions, in relation to the
                        Embassy and to Dr. Cressey, is being made the subject of a separate

                     <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>.</note> the point here is that Dr. Fairbank has served in

                        of course be filled under present housing and staff conditions—and that he
                        has rendered valuable service to the Embassy. We feel that Dr. Fairbank
                        should be commended for his assistance to us in the cultural relations
                        program.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                        despatch no. 1915, December 15, 1943, in regard to the assistance rendered
                        the Embassy by Dr. John K. Fairbank in connection with the cultural
                        relations program.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the apparent misunderstanding, mentioned in the reference
                        despatch, as to the relationship among Dr. Kates, Dr. George B. Cressey, the
                        Department and the Embassy, confusion seems now to have arisen in regard to
                        Dr. Kates’ functions under IDC and OSS. It is our understanding from
                        conversations with Dr. Kates that in taking over Dr. Fairbank’s work he has
                        considered that he should more narrowly confine himself to the official
                        purposes for which he was assigned here by IDC (and/or OSS) and by the
                        Library of Congress and should devote his chief interests to matters having
                        direct relation to the war effort in his field: i. e. to the procurement of
                        enemy publications. The carrying on of the cultural relations microfilm
                        program (which was entrusted to Dr. Fairbank in order to give him some <hi rend="italic">quid pro quo</hi> to offer possible sources of enemy
                        publications) he feels is somewhat outside the technical scope of his
                        appropriate activities but he is agreeable to continuing with it for the
                        time being. <pb n="761" xml:id="pg_761" facs="0771"/>As the Embassy can not
                        under present staff conditions assign an officer to full-time cultural
                        relations duties and as under present housing and office conditions we can
                        not take care of a cultural attaché, we have expressed to Dr. Kates our hope
                        that he will find it feasible and profitable to continue Dr. Fairbank’s
                        excellent work with the microfilm program until the Embassy is in position
                        to take over the operation of the program from him.</p>
                    <p>We believe that Dr. Kates is earnestly desirous of cooperating with the
                        Embassy in every way but we feel that the question of his functions and his
                        relationships with various organizations and persons has been left so
                        unclear that inevitable problems are beginning to arise. We understand, for
                        example, that during Brigadier General Donovan’s<note n="42" xml:id="d682fn42">William J. Donovan, Director of the Office of
                            Strategic Services.</note> recent visit to Chungking (Embassy’s 2332,
                        December 6, 4 p.m.<note n="43" xml:id="d682fn43">Not printed.</note>) he
                        instructed Dr. Kates to have nothing whatsoever to do with representatives
                        of the Chinese Communist party in Chungking, including individuals to whom
                        he had been introduced by Dr. Fairbank and from whom Dr. Fairbank expected
                        to obtain publications and information thought to be of interest to IDC or
                        to other agencies of the Government; and that General Donovan also
                        instructed Dr. Kates to hold in abeyance a program (of which the Embassy had
                        not previously been informed) of purchasing enemy publications from the
                        British Military Attaché and from General Wang Peng-sheng, adviser to the
                        Generalissimo on Japanese affairs and head of one of the Chinese secret
                        gestapo services which is in some respects a rival of General Tai Li’s
                        organization with which OSS and the Navy Department (or some section of the
                        Navy Department) are endeavoring to operate.</p>
                    <p>General Donovan did not mention to us in our discussion with him of OSS
                        activities as they have relation to the Embassy any matters connected with
                        Dr. Fairbank’s or Dr. Kates’ work. He indicated that Captain M. E. Miles,
                        U.S.N., who unfortunately has designation as Naval Observer to the Embassy
                        and who has been the principal OSS representative here, was no longer
                        connected with OSS although he was continuing certain activities under
                        General Tai Li’s direction pursuant to an agreement between Tai Li and the
                        Navy Department. General Donovan stated that a Major Hoffman, who
                        accompanied him to China, would be chief OSS man here and that Major Hoffman
                        would call at the Embassy with a view to clarifying any matters of
                        appropriate interest to this Mission. (Major Hoffman has not called and we
                        have not encountered him.)</p>
                    <p>What relationship is supposed to exist between Major Hoffman and Dr. Kates
                        seems obscure. Dr. Kates understands that he is in some <pb n="762" xml:id="pg_762" facs="0772"/>respects under Major Hoffman’s instructions
                        and, as the Embassy should be divorced from OSS operations (which in our
                        opinion should be under the control of the American Theater Commander<note n="44" xml:id="d682fn44">Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell.</note>), the question
                        arises whether Dr. Kates should continue to have the formal affiliation with
                        the Embassy involved in his designation as Special Assistant so long as he
                        operates under the instructions of the OSS military group and may, for all
                        we know, be called upon to engage in activities with which the Embassy has
                        no concern and over which it has no control. (Similarly Captain Miles should
                        not, of course, have any designation formally affiliating him with the
                        Embassy.)</p>
                    <p>We feel that Dr. Kates can be of service to the American Government in the
                        procurement of enemy publications and publications for the Library of
                        Congress, and also in cultural relations—the handling of the microfilm
                        program as a Special Assistant to the Embassy. But the confusing or
                        intermixing of these activities with what are generally understood to be OSS
                        operations and activities, which places him in the unhappy position of
                        endeavoring to please several masters, is bound to work out most
                        unsatisfactorily.</p>
                    <p>The question of Dr. Kates’ relationship with Dr. Cressey, mentioned in the
                        reference despatch, appears to have arisen from a misunderstanding which in
                        turn possibly grew out of oral comment or remarks made to Dr. Cressey by
                        officers of the Cultural Relations Division of the Department and also
                        possibly out of oral remarks made to Dr. Kates and Dr. Cressey by Dr.
                        Fairbank. So far as we are informed, Dr. Cressey and Dr. Kates have no
                        official relationship and Dr. Kates now understands that he does not
                        “represent” Dr. Cressey as “representative of the Department of State”
                        during the latter’s absence from Chungking. Furthermore, the Embassy does
                        not understand that Dr. Cressey is in fact a “representative of the
                        Department of State” but that he is a visiting professor of the Cultural
                        Relations Division of the Department. (We have just received, as we were
                        closing this despatch, the Department’s mail instruction no. 450, November
                        17, 1943,<note n="44a" xml:id="d682fn46">Not printed.</note> enclosing a
                        copy of Mr. Peck’s memorandum<note n="45" xml:id="d682fn45">Of October 12,
                                <ref target="#pg_751">p. 751</ref>.</note> in regard to Dr. Cressey
                        and his functions; that subject will accordingly be treated in a separate
                        despatch.)</p>
                    <p>We do not have specific recommendations to submit at this time as to possible
                        solution of these various confusions and difficulties in regard to
                        relationships, jurisdictions, etc., except that if Dr. Kates is to be under
                        the orders of Major Hoffman of OSS to perform functions of OSS over which
                        the Embassy does not have (and does not desire to have) any supervision or
                        control, his designation as Special Assistant <pb n="763" xml:id="pg_763" facs="0773"/>to the Embassy should be canceled. If he is to continue to
                        serve under such designation, or under any designation affiliating him with
                        the Embassy, we believe that arrangements should be effected in Washington
                        whereby his functions are clearly defined within a framework of activities
                        over which the Embassy may appropriately exercise supervision and
                        control.</p>
                    <p>In general it would be helpful to the Embassy and also to the persons
                        concerned if the Department could see its way clear, before cultural
                        relations specialists or other persons whose duties have bearing on cultural
                        relations depart from the United States for China, to formulating in
                        consultation with the Embassy specific instructions for their guidance and
                        to making sure that all possible questions of this nature are completely
                        clarified in the employee’s mind.</p>

                    <p>Professor Chiao Tsai, one of the Chinese professors who is in this country at
                        the invitation of the Department, told me that in a recent conversation a
                        Mr. Kohlberg of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, who returned
                        to the United States from China about two months ago, had informed him that
                        two of the cultural relations experts at Kunming had made very derogatory
                        remarks to him about China. Professor Tsai said that Kohlberg’s comment was
                        that it seemed incomprehensible that cultural relations personnel sent to
                        China to improve relations between the two countries should engage in
                        activity which would inevitably worsen those relations. I was unable to
                        learn from Professor Tsai who the two experts were.</p>
                    <p>I told Professor Tsai that our experts were specialists along technical lines
                        and that some of them had never been outside the United States. I said that
                        it is an American trait to criticize anything and everything within their
                        own country, and that these experts had apparently forgotten that they were
                        abroad. I did not try to excuse the experts but took occasion to say that
                        Americans consider criticism a good thing and that I thought China would be
                        a lot better off if there was more criticism in China. I stated, however,
                        that criticism should come from the people of the country, as criticism from
                        outsiders was resented by all nations. I also took occasion to point out
                        that Chinese were free to criticize the United States, that we Americans
                        felt free to criticize the British, and that the <pb n="764" xml:id="pg_764" facs="0774"/>Russians felt free to criticize the British and Americans,
                        especially in regard to our delay in opening [the] second front. He finally
                        agreed with me that criticism was a fairly universal trait, and not
                        necessarily something evil.</p>
                    <p>As this incident has been brought to the Department’s attention, it might be
                        advisable to instruct the Embassy at Chungking to caution cultural relations
                        experts in the future to be more guarded in their comments.</p>

                        instructions Nos. 406 of September 27, 1943 and 420 of October 11,
                            1943,<note n="46" xml:id="d684fn46">Latter not printed.</note> in regard
                        to a proposal of the Ministry of Communications to send 500 technicians
                        annually to the United States for training, and to enclose a copy of a
                        letter from the Minister of Communications dated December 8, 1943,<note n="47" xml:id="d684fn47">Not printed.</note> with which he transmits
                        details of the plan drawn up by the Ministry.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The Ministry is preparing to send 285
                            technicians abroad during the first year of the plan, including 200 to
                            the United States and 85 to Great Britain and Canada. They will be sent
                            out at the earliest possible date after the selection and examinations
                            now under way are completed. The Ministry contemplates the sending of
                            superintendents abroad to supervise the studies of the junior engineers
                            and to facilitate the smooth working of the plan. Two classes of
                            technicians are mentioned, including senior officials of the Ministry
                            who will be sent abroad on inspection tours (30 in the first year of the
                            plan) and junior engineers who will be sent abroad for practical
                            training (255 in the first year). Of the last named category,
                            technicians will be allocated to specialize in railway, highway,
                            telecommunication, navigation and aviation matters. <hi rend="italic">End of Summary.</hi>

                    <p>It is believed that the Department may wish to transmit details of this plan
                        to the Secretary of Labor (Department’s Instruction No. 420 of October 11,
                        1943) and to the Secretary of the Treasury (Department’s Airgram No. 87,
                        October 2, 1943). Information in regard to the plan of the Chinese
                        Government to send technical students to the United States for study was
                        given in the Embassy’s despatch No. 1819, November 16, 1943, to which the
                        Department may wish to refer in connection with the present despatch.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I beg to inform you that in
                        maps and globes published in the United States, distinctions, either by
                        difference of color or by other specifications, have been made between some
                        outlying Provinces, such as the Four Northeastern Provinces, Sinkiang, Outer
                        Mongolia, Tibet, etc. and other Provinces of the Republic of China. In most
                        cases the word “Manchukuo” has been used for the Four Northeastern
                        Provinces, and in some cases the name “Tannu Tuva” has appeared for a part
                        of Outer Mongolia. Mongolia is often listed as a protectorate and Sinkiang
                        as a sphere of influence under the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
                    <p>These distinctions do not follow the boundary line of China as recognized by
                        the Government of the United States, and tend to create erroneous
                        impressions among the American people. I shall be greatly obliged if you
                        will be good enough to call attention of the American publishers and
                        manufacturers, especially Replogle Globes, 314 North Hoyne Avenue, Chicago,
                        Illinois, and other educational institutions to the above errors, with a
                        view to preventing their re-occurrence in the future.</p>

                    <p>The letter of June 10, 1943, from the Chinese Ambassador, regarding an
                        American made globe on which Chinese territories are shown as under Japanese
                        sovereignty or Russian influence, presents a problem which assumes a
                        different aspect in wartime.</p>

                    <p>Considerable harm may be done to the cause of the United Nations in the war
                        effort if private map publishers follow their own hunches and predilections,
                        at least in the absence of any reliable information or suggestion regarding
                        cartographic policy. Representatives of the press, in press conferences, are
                        frequently given background information, which most of them respect
                        scrupulously. If private map publishers and globe makers were given
                        information and suggestions intimating the effect of their map practices
                        upon international comity I believe many, if not all, of the publishers
                        would welcome it, always upon the condition that freedom of the press as
                        they understand it is not infringed. They are, of course, jealous of their
                        right, in attempting to keep their maps “realistic” and up-to-date in order
                        to sell their maps to advantage, to adopt a policy which sometimes
                        disregards the official viewpoint of the Department of State.</p>
                    <p>The National Geographic Society, however, has been very considerate of
                        international public opinion, especially since about 1932, when Dr.
                            Hornbeck<note n="1" xml:id="d686fn1">Stanley K. Hornbeck, Chief of the
                            Division of Far Eastern Affairs, 1928–1937; Adviser on Political
                            Relations, 1937–1944.</note> and I discussed with Dr. Grosvenor the
                        undesirability of their publishing and distributing a map showing
                        “Manchukuo” under Japanese sovereignty; and ever since that time the
                        National Geographic Society has always been very conscious of the mischief
                        that might be done by their maps, because of their very wide distribution in
                        all continents, if they unduly offend the sensibilities of the governments
                        and peoples in the foreign countries in which they are circulated. The
                        Renner article and maps in <hi rend="italic">Collier’s</hi> did much harm,
                        and the maps in the new <hi rend="italic">Britannica</hi> atlas might have
                        produced very unfortunate results if they had not been modified shortly
                        before publication last winter.</p>

                                freedom of the press in the United States makes it difficult to
                                suggest to private publishers what policies they should follow in
                                such matters; and to do nothing except when representations are
                                received from foreign governments;</item>

                                which, in their attempt to be realistic and up-to-date, are
                                unfortunate in their treatment of sovereignty matters.</item>

                                of private map publishers with reference to the indication of
                                sovereignty and territorial claims on their maps and globes.</item>

                    <p>The attached draft letter to Rand McNally and Company accords with the second
                        of the alternatives indicated above. To restrict such a letter to Chinese
                        interest in the matter may suggest that the Department has received a
                        communication from the Chinese Government. On the other hand, to give
                        additional illustrations from Europe would be very difficult under present
                        conditions—unless we were simply to suggest that 1937 international
                        boundaries be shown in Europe until post-war settlements shall have
                        clarified the situation.</p>
                    <p>We have enough problems without inviting the map manufacturers to write the
                        Department more frequently for assistance. It is a question whether the
                        interests of the war and the coming peace require a more active policy in
                        these matters.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Sirs</hi>: Because of the harm that may be
                            inadvertently done to the war effort and to the interest of friendly
                            relations among the United Nations, your attention is invited to
                            situations that sometimes arise in foreign countries from the
                            publication in the United States of maps and globes which portray
                            unilateral territorial claims of one country, to the disadvantage of
                            another country which claims sovereignty.</p>
                        <p>It is very difficult both for government officials and for private
                            citizens in some foreign countries to understand how maps and globes can
                            be published in the United States representing sovereignty and claims of
                            sovereignty in a manner which may be wholly at variance with the policy
                            of the United States Government, because in those countries no private
                            publisher is permitted to produce and distribute maps which are not in
                            accord with the policy of the government. Hence, such maps published in
                            the United States sometimes become the subject of representations to the
                            Department of State by the governments of the countries concerned. In
                            such instances the Department <pb n="768" xml:id="pg_768" facs="0778"/>explains, in effect, that under our freedom of the press, publishers
                            in the United States are at liberty to produce and distribute maps and
                            other publications without regard to viewpoints or policies of the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>I have thought that, in the light of present world conditions and of our
                            common interest in the furtherance of friendly and cooperative relations
                            among the United Nations, you may wish to be apprised of the fact that
                            such situations arise, and that, in this connection, you might like to
                            have an illustration of the Department’s own cartographic practice.
                            Thus, if a map of China were being prepared in the Department, the
                            entire territory of the Republic of China would be included without
                            distinction between its constituent parts, although the inner limits of
                            Tibet and Outer Mongolia might be shown as internal boundaries similar
                            to those of the provinces of “China Proper” including those of
                            Manchuria, and of the provinces of Sinkiang, Sikang (Chwanpien),
                            Tsinghai (Kokonor), Mngsia, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Jehol. In general,
                            unilateral claims of any country, and occupation of territory by force,
                            would not be represented as valid, or as constituting anything more than
                            a claim by that country.</p>
                        <p>Very truly yours,</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Soong, called on me this
                        afternoon by appointment at his request. On the occasion of his last call, a
                        few days ago, Dr. Soong had asked for samples of our modern treaties of
                        commerce. I gave Dr. Soong collections, in duplicate, of such treaties,
                        chosen and made up by TD<note n="1" xml:id="d687fn1">Division of Treaty
                            Affairs.</note> and TA;<note n="2" xml:id="d687fn2">Division of
                            Commercial Policy and Agreements.</note> and I made certain comments in
                        line with suggestions made by those Divisions. Having looked the collection
                        over briefly, Dr. Soong inquired whether we had not made treaties with Great
                        Britain, France and Germany. I replied that we had made a treaty in the
                        early 20’s with Germany<note n="3" xml:id="d687fn3">Signed at Washington,
                            December 8, 1923, <ref target="frus1923v02#pg_29">
                        <hi rend="italic">Foreign Relations</hi>, 1923, vol. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii</hi>, p. 29</ref>.</note> but not, I thought, any new treaties
                        of <hi rend="italic">commerce</hi> with Great Britain or France. I showed
                        Dr. Soong the text of the treaty with Germany as it appears in the fourth
                        volume of the Malloy (in continuation) collection; and I undertook to try to
                        procure “separate” copies of that treaty for Dr. Soong.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then inquired whether I had seen a bill that has been introduced in
                        Congress by Mr. Kennedy.<note n="4" xml:id="d687fn4">H. R. 1882, 78th Cong.,
                            1st sess: “To grant to the Chinese rights of entry to the United States
                            and rights to citizenship.”</note> I inquired whether he was referring
                        to a bill providing for the repeal of certain legislation. Dr. Soong replied
                        that that was the bill that he had in mind, a bill bearing on the question
                        of Chinese exclusion. I said that I had seen the bill and references to it
                        in the press. Dr. Soong inquired what I thought of it. I replied that I had
                        heard favorable comment with regard to it. Dr. Soong then made observations
                        to the effect that the problems of a Minister for Foreign Affairs are many
                        and complicated. I replied that it seemed to me that they were becoming more
                        so, in both respects, every day; and that I wondered that any Minister for
                        Foreign Affairs could keep in mind the many facts of which it is necessary
                        that he have knowledge and the many problems to which it <pb n="770" xml:id="pg_770" facs="0780"/>is necessary that he give attention. Dr.
                        Soong then said that the best that one can do is to choose a few subjects,
                        three or four, and delegate authority regarding the rest—hoping that they
                        will be properly handled. I gained the impression that Dr. Soong is in
                        process of making up his mind regarding the question of choosing the “three
                        or four” subjects upon which he will try to concentrate. I am reasonably
                        sure, from questions which he has brought up with me in past conversations
                        and in the conversation of which record is now being made, and some
                        questions which Dr. Soong’s right-hand man, Dr. Alfred Sze, has put to me
                        recently, that two of these questions are going to be (1) the question of
                        negotiating a new commercial treaty between China and the United States<note n="5" xml:id="d687fn5">See <ref target="#pg_710">pp. 710</ref>
                            ff.</note> and (2) the question of Chinese immigration into the United
                        States and matters relating to and connected therewith.</p>

                    <p>I called on the Speaker by appointment and he asked Mr. McCormack to sit in.
                        I was accompanied by Mr. Johnston.<note n="6" xml:id="d688fn6">Felton M.

               </p>
                    <p>I presented the Department’s point of view which envisaged the four Bills
                        presently pending in the House of Representatives and referred to the
                        Immigration Committee covering different phases of repeal or amendment to
                        the Chinese Exclusion Laws<note n="7" xml:id="d688fn7">For information

                        next Tuesday, and stated that the Department was not unsympathetic to any
                        proposal the Congress might make in regard to a change in the prohibition of
                        Chinese immigration and citizenship, but the Department felt very sincerely
                        that it would be unfortunate in the extreme from the point of view of our
                        international relations if a Bill should be reported out by the Committee
                        and an acrimonious debate should occur on the Floor and the Bill failed
                        passage. Even an acrimonious debate would be unpleasant from the
                        international point of view.</p>
                    <pb n="771" xml:id="pg_771" facs="0781"/>
                    <p>Consequently it was suggested that efforts be made by the leadership to
                        determine in advance the attitude of both the House and the Senate on this
                        delicate political question before the hearings were proceeded with.</p>
                    <p>The Speaker was in entire accord with the suggestion. However, Mr. McCormack
                        developed into an advocate for opening up the whole subject without previous
                        information as to the attitude of the House members. He felt that the Bill
                        providing for the admission of the Chinese wives of American citizens, which
                        he estimated at about four to six thousand, should be brought up and
                        presented for passage. This, he thought, would be the opening wedge and it
                        would serve to estimate the temper of the House. If this Bill should pass
                        then other Bills might be brought on. The others would have wider scope.</p>
                    <p>I stated to the Speaker and Mr. McCormack that the attitude of the Department
                        of State would probably find itself in support of a movement to permit the
                        immigration and naturalization of persons resident in China and born in
                        China to be admitted under the quota. This would probably admit as many as
                        100 or 150 a year and make them eligible to citizenship. However, the
                        Department was very definite in its thought that the attitude of the House
                        toward a proposal involving all of the parts of the proposed Bills or any of
                        the general legislation on the subject should be estimated in advance and
                        that the passage of the Bills be not presented unless the House would react
                        favorably.</p>
                    <p>The conversation continued for more than an hour. Mr. McCormack continued to
                        press his point of view.</p>
                    <p>The Speaker adopted the Department’s point of view and stated that he would
                        make some inquiry and would telephone me on Monday. It was doubtful in my
                        mind whether he would be able to control the enthusiasm of the Majority
                        Leader.</p>

                    <p>In pursuance of a decision arrived at in a conference in the Secretary’s
                        office on May 26 and under instruction from Mr. Long, I took advantage on
                        the evening of May 27 of an opportunity casually to bring up this
                            subject<note n="8" xml:id="d689fn8">i. e., immigration legislation in
                            regard to the Chinese.</note> with the Chinese Ambassador.<note n="8a" xml:id="d689fn12">Wei Tao-ming.</note> In the course of a social
                        conversation, I asked the Ambassador whether the Embassy had been observing
                        the bills which had been introduced in the <pb n="772" xml:id="pg_772" facs="0782"/>House of Representatives and the hearings which have been
                        going on regarding the question of Chinese immigration into this country.
                        The Ambassador replied that the Embassy had been following these matters
                        closely. I asked whether he would be willing to give me his impressions. The
                        Ambassador replied that his first impression was that there was a
                        preponderance of friendly sentiment toward the Chinese; next, he said, the
                        Embassy felt that the Kennedy bill had special merit because of its
                        simplicity and its comprehensiveness; third, what the Chinese are most
                        interested in was to get rid of discrimination and, fourth, the Chinese
                        wondered whether it might not be possible for legislation on the lines of
                        the Kennedy bill to be passed in the comparatively near future. This last
                        point the Ambassador turned into a question: what did I think of the
                        possibility of fairly prompt action.</p>
                    <p>Confronted with that question, I took occasion to say that, speaking
                        informally and unofficially, I was by no means sure that anything could be
                        done speedily. I said that it is an easy thing to introduce a bill but it is
                        quite another thing to produce a bill which has the qualifications necessary
                        for approval first in the committee and second in the Congress itself. The
                        immigration question is, I said, a complicated question full of
                        technicalities and weighted with the influence of history and considerations
                        of regional experiences and concepts, political and other prejudices,
                        economic and psychological facts and fancies. From the point of view of
                        international relations, I said, it is highly desirable that such bill as
                        may be approved in the committee and sent forward for consideration on the
                        floor of the House and of the Senate be a bill which on the one hand will
                        not provoke acrimonious discussion and on the other hand, no matter what the
                        discussion, will not be defeated. I therefore thought, I said, that the
                        committee would doubtless give any and all bills intensive scrutiny—which, I
                        said, would require time.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he thoroughly understood and shared in the view that
                        whatever bill received consideration of the Congress should be a bill that
                        would not be defeated. He again mentioned the Kennedy bill and again
                        expressed the hope that something could be done without great delay. I
                        inquired who at the Embassy is following the matter most closely. The
                        Ambassador replied that Dr. Liu, the Counselor, is giving the question
                        special attention.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> Except for the point of his apparent
                        featuring of the Kennedy bill, the points which the Ambassador made are what
                        I expected to hear. The Chinese Government is interested in removal of our
                        discriminations against the Chinese as Chinese; they are eager for
                        recognition, technical at least, of China and the Chinese on a <pb n="773" xml:id="pg_773" facs="0783"/>basis of “equality”. The fact, however,
                        that the Ambassador twice expressed a hope that something might be done
                        without undue delay causes me to speculate as to the possibility that he had
                        the present military and economic situation in unoccupied China—which
                        situation is becoming acute especially from point of view of morale—much in
                        mind. What the Ambassador said, together with other indications, causes me
                        to believe that it is desirable from point of view of the war effort for us
                        to work along as liberal lines as may be possible and as expeditiously as
                        may be possible toward doing something constructive with regard to the
                        solution of this question.</p>
                    <p>A clearer indication than was given by the Ambassador of what really is in
                        the minds of the Chinese leaders is given in an excerpt—of which I shall
                        attach hereto a copy<note n="9" xml:id="d689fn9">Not printed.</note>—of an
                        address which Dr. Sze has prepared for delivery at Elmira College on May 31.
                        Dr. Sze has lived more years of his life in this country than in any other.
                        He had practically all of his education in this country. He has been both
                        Chinese Minister and Chinese Ambassador to this country. He has during his
                        life in Washington made many contacts among the membership of the Congress.
                        He has worked on questions such as the question of Chinese “exclusion” for
                        many years. He is now very close to China’s Foreign Minister, Dr. T. V.
                        Soong. I cannot imagine his making a public statement on the subject of the
                        exclusion legislation without his having talked the matter over carefully
                        with Soong and having weighed every word.—In Dr. Sze’s statement emphasis is
                        laid on the question of “discriminations which American law imposes upon
                        Chinese as a race”; also upon treatment similar to that which is accorded to
                        “the nationals of other countries”. He says that “the Chinese do not ask
                        that they be favored beyond other peoples”; “the matter has now become
                        almost wholly one of national respect”; and he speaks of “several proposals
                        of laws introduced in Congress for the complete repeal of all the provisions
                        of the laws … which place Chinese in a position of inferiority of rights as
                        compared with the other civilized races of the world”; and, finally, he
                        says, “Perhaps … I should not have spoken of this matter, but, so important
                        is it, that … I have felt that it was not out of place that I should make
                        public mention of this matter when opportunity has presented itself”.<note n="10" xml:id="d689fn10">Omissions in this sentence indicated in the

                    <p>Majority Leader McCormack called me by telephone today and told me that he
                        had sounded out some of the members from the West Coast and they were not
                        opposed to legislation during war-time admitting Chinese in limited
                        quantities. He thought there would be a good deal of sentiment in the
                        Congress for such legislation. He thought the Chinese Wives Bill could be
                        reported out and passed.</p>
                    <p>I told him we had been giving serious consideration to the subject matter and
                        wondered whether legislation would be agreeable if it placed the Chinese
                        under the quota and repealed the discriminatory provisions of the Chinese
                        Exclusion Laws. The legislation should also make Chinese admitted thereunder
                        eligible to citizenship—the legislation would not affect Chinese persons now
                        under the war-time jurisdiction of Japan.</p>
                    <p>He said that he thought there would be sentiment for such legislation and
                        that it could be passed. I told him that it had been suggested I talk with
                        Mr. Dickstein.<note n="12" xml:id="d690fn12">Samuel Dickstein, Chairman of

                    <p>I met this morning with Speaker Rayburn and Majority Leader McCormack. They
                        decided that they would call for this afternoon an executive meeting of the
                        Democratic members of the Immigration Committee and they asked me to be
                        present.</p>
                    <p>At three-thirty this afternoon I met with the Speaker, Majority Leader and
                        the Democratic members of the Committee on Immigration, including Mr.
                        Dickstein, the chairman, who had introduced two bills in the matter of
                        Chinese immigration and exclusion now pending before this Committee. Also
                        pending are two other measures. The Committee has been holding public
                        sessions.</p>
                    <pb n="775" xml:id="pg_775" facs="0785"/>
                    <p>The meeting proceeded to discuss the general principles involved without
                        paying detailed attention to the technicalities of the situation. It soon
                        developed that there was a very considerable disunity of opinion amongst the
                        members of the Committee. Mr. Allen of Louisiana and Mr. McGehee of
                        Mississippi were definitely opposed to any Chinese immigration or any other
                        Oriental immigration. They expressed the thought that we had put up a
                        Chinese wall and that if we battered one hole in the wall there would be a
                        lot of other holes knocked in the wall and the result would be disastrous.
                        They were adamant in their opposition.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dickstein urged the passage of his bill to repeal the exclusion feature
                        and the passage of another measure which provides for Chinese immigration on
                        a quota basis. The Speaker was inclined to proceed to that extent. Mr.
                        McCormack made a characteristically impassioned plea for immigration under
                        the quota. Each member present spoke in varying degrees of assent or
                        opposition.</p>
                    <p>I limited my remarks to the international political phases of the matter;
                        painted the plight of China in her long standing military struggle with
                        Japan and the difficulties she was encountering; I related the desire of the
                        Chinese to be placed upon an equality with other nations; stated that their
                        disappointment would be great if a bill was passed which did not give them
                        that satisfaction; stated that the Department of State was not there to
                        advise the Congress as to what it should do but to give the members of the
                        Congress the benefit of our understanding of our international relations and
                        the effect upon them of any measures that might pass; stated that it might
                        be most unfortunate to bring out a bill for acrimonious debate—which would
                        itself be bad—and have the bill defeated, which would mark a very decided
                        worsening in our relations with China.</p>
                    <p>They all agreed that something should be done for China, though one of the
                        members was very reluctant to say that he would support even the bill
                        repealing exclusion. He stated that he would not vote against it if that was
                        the desire of his colleagues present but would probably absent himself. He
                        could not support the bill. Another member present stated that if a bill
                        providing for Chinese immigration on a quota basis or any other limited
                        basis were introduced into the House and up for discussion on the floor, he
                        would propose an amendment to prohibit all immigration from all sources for
                        a period of ten years.</p>
                    <p>There developed to be a strong sympathy for restricting immigration. Several
                        members present, including the Speaker, were of the opinion that if such an
                        amendment were proposed on the floor of the House it would probably
                        carry.</p>
                    <pb n="776" xml:id="pg_776" facs="0786"/>
                    <p>In the course of the meeting there developed an entire disparity of thought
                        with a certainty that any bill reported by the Committee would lack the
                        support of some members of the Committee and that any provision for Chinese
                        immigration under the quota or any other extent would find active opposition
                        from at least five or six of the eleven present, with the chances in favor
                        of eight or nine being opposed.</p>
                    <p>However, they each expressed their desire to make some gesture to China
                        because of the war. They thought that if the Exclusion Act were repealed it
                        would give the State Department an opportunity to counteract Japanese
                        propaganda by stating that Chinese as such were no longer excluded. I
                        questioned the value of any such measure.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Speaker stated that it was his opinion that the meeting should
                        come to a unanimous agreement to report out the Dickstein bill providing for
                        repeal of exclusion, that bill to be passed under a rule which would
                        prohibit debate, and that an attempt be made to secure the cooperation of
                        the Republican leadership so that it could pass by unanimous consent. He
                        asked each member of the Committee present if they could subscribe to such a
                        course. With some reluctance one or two of them assented and the rest all
                        agreed. Mr. Dickstein was entirely dissatisfied but said that he would go
                        along.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that at the Committee meeting tomorrow there would be reported
                        out the Dickstein bill repealing the Exclusion Act, with the support of all
                        the Democratic members of the Committee and an effort on the part of the
                        Democratic leadership to secure the collaboration of the Republican
                        leadership, and the granting of a rule which would provide for a vote
                        without debate.</p>
                    <p>I took no part in the decision and was simply there as announced and as above
                        reported. An effort was made to elicit an expression of opinion for the
                        Department of State as to whether the Department would support a limitation
                        upon immigration from European countries provided a quota was assigned to
                        China to the maximum of 50 persons per year. I replied that those were
                        matters for the decision of the Congress and the Department of State was an
                        executive authority which administered the laws passed by the Congress.</p>
                    <p>The meeting adjourned after an hour and a half of intense discussion.</p>

                    <postscript>
                        <p>Mr. Dickstein later called me to state that he was not in the mood to
                            report out his bill; he did not want his name to be on just an exclusion
                            bill; that he felt very keenly on the question of immigration for the
                            Chinese and the privilege of citizenship; that he thought he would not
                            call a meeting of the Committee tomorrow and that he had asked for a
                            meeting with the Majority Leader to discuss this matter with him.</p>
                        <pb n="777" xml:id="pg_777" facs="0787"/>
                        <p>I replied that if the bill was reported out and sent to the Senate there
                            might be some amendments placed upon it in the Senate which the House
                            could accept in conference and which would change the situation. I did
                            not know how the Senate would feel toward this or any other such bill. I
                            stated that I had thought that he had bound himself to support the
                            program in the Committee and that I could not argue with him on that
                            point or any other point involving legislative policy and that if he had
                            any opinion to express he should present it to the Speaker and to the
                            Majority Leader.</p>
                        <p>From his closing remarks I judged that he was temporarily excited and
                            that he would probably be calmed down in conversation with the Majority
                            Leader and would support the opinion of his colleagues at the conference
                            this afternoon.</p>

                    <p>The question of there being taken action by the American Government toward
                        removing or relaxing the discriminatory features of this country’s
                        legislation and practices in regard to immigration of Chinese is one which
                        now and henceforth until appropriate action has been taken this Government
                        is and will be compelled to face. The Chinese have reached a point in their
                        political evolution, and the spirit of nationalism has developed among them
                        to a point from which it naturally and inevitably flows that they are taking
                        and will increasingly take exception to situations and action in and on the
                        part of other countries the implications of which are a political assessment
                        of the Chinese race as “inferior” and of Chinese persons as
                        “undesirables.”</p>
                    <p>During the past forty years the Japanese, increasingly smarting under the
                        grievance, as they saw it, of our discrimination against them as a race,
                        made of this discrimination a diplomatic issue and used the fact of this
                        discrimination as a springboard and a projectile of propaganda among their
                        own people against the white race in general and the United States in
                        particular. The burning hostility of such men as the late Admiral Yamamoto
                        toward the United States, and the desire and intention and plans and efforts
                        of such men to make war upon and defeat the United States were animated in
                        no small part by their view of and emotions regarding this matter of
                        discrimination on our part against the race of which they were and are
                        members.</p>
                    <p>Until recently, the Chinese did not permit themselves greatly to be agitated
                        on this subject. They had other and more practical problems, <pb n="778" xml:id="pg_778" facs="0788"/>questions and issues over which to worry
                        and with which to try to cope. They were conscious of their own comparative
                        helplessness. They were confident of their inherent capacities and of the
                        substantial quality of their culture. They regarded themselves as a “have”
                        nation and, believing that they had it, they were not looking for a “place
                        in the sun.” Now, however, the Chinese are becoming increasingly conscious
                        of various and sundry of the disagreeable realities of international
                        relationships; they are becoming aware of disabilities which flow from
                        discriminations; they are becoming desirous of wider, more effective, more
                        influential contacts with and among the governments and peoples of other
                        countries; they are taking stock of the potentialities of their huge
                        manpower and their relatively rich resources; they have seen it demonstrated
                        that liberty and freedom and equal rights, etc., etc. accrue to those who
                        demand and insist upon having them; and they are fully committed to a course
                        wherein they will increasingly resent and contend against discrimination
                        against their race by other countries.</p>
                    <p>The sooner we, the Government and people of the United States, face this
                        issue, the easier will it be, in terms of reasonable costs, for us to handle
                        it in a manner least disadvantageous to ourselves and most politically
                        advantageous to all concerned. The question, between ourselves and the
                        Chinese, has not yet reached the stage where embitterment and inflamed
                        prejudice stand in the way of arriving at a mutually acceptable
                        solution.</p>
                    <p>The immediate problem so far as this country is concerned is that of so
                        revising our laws and procedures as to eliminate discrimination against the
                        Chinese and at the same time safeguard ourselves against a large influx of
                        Chinese immigrants. It is readily possible to produce a legislative formula
                        which will accomplish simultaneously both of these two objectives.</p>
                    <p>The practical political problem that confronts us is that of bringing about
                        adoption by the Congress of such a formula.</p>
                    <p>Scrutiny of the contemporary situation leads to an impression that there is
                        at present widespread popular opinion favorably disposed toward China and
                        the Chinese; and that both the public and the majority of the members of
                        Congress are favorably disposed in principle toward some action indicative
                        of this country’s admiration of and well wishes toward the Chinese as a
                        fighting group whose interests and efforts are linked with ours in the
                        conflict with the Axis powers and particularly with Japan. Further, there
                        appears to be a substantial number of the members of the Congress,
                        especially in the House, who would like to do something effective toward
                        revising our legislation in the direction of removing our discriminations
                        against <pb n="779" xml:id="pg_779" facs="0789"/>the Chinese. In the
                        Committee on Immigration of the House there appears to be a majority of
                        opinion favorable to removal of discriminations but apprehensive of a
                        possible influx of a considerable number of Chinese and apprehensive of
                        other aspects of the question of Oriental immigration; and in that Committee
                        there is no majority of opinion favorable to any one specific proposal; and
                        in that Committee there is a minority which is opposed to any revision
                        whatever of our immigration legislation. There have come a number of
                        indications that the Committee would welcome and appreciate guidance from
                        the executive branch of the Government; especially from the Department of
                        State and the Department of Justice. There has thus far been given more
                        indication of willingness on the part of the Department of Justice than on
                        the part of the Department of State to give guidance in this matter.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that this question is of importance from point of view of the
                        current and the future influence of the United States in our relations not
                        only with China but with other countries of Asia and of the world in
                        general. It has been traditional in American pronouncements on the subject
                        of foreign policy and international relations for us to talk of “equality of
                        opportunity” and “equality of treatment”. In recent years, and especially
                        during the régime since 1933, we have especially emphasized those two
                        principles. We have featured the concept underlying them by our
                        participation in the formulating of the Atlantic Charter<note n="13" xml:id="d692fn13">Joint declaration by President Roosevelt and British
                            Prime Minister Churchill, August 14, 1941, Department of State <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>, August 16, 1941, p. 125, or 55 Stat.
                            1603.</note> and the Declaration of the United Nations.<note n="14" xml:id="d692fn14">Dated January 1, 1942, Department of State Executive
                            Agreement Series No. 236, or 55 Stat. 1600.</note> We constantly refer
                        to them either expressly or by implication in statements regarding postwar
                        policy and intended practices. The Chinese are beginning to quote us in
                        terms of “deeds are more important and more conclusive than words”; they are
                        watching and scrutinizing our acts, our action of commission and our action
                        of omission; they are calling upon us for performance. Their attitude toward
                        us is going to be affected more and more by their view of the treatment
                        which we accord or fail to accord them. This question of Chinese exclusion
                        and of revision of or failure to make revision of our immigration laws in so
                        far as the Chinese are affected is, therefore, of importance from point of
                        view of foreign relations. It therefore would seem that the executive branch
                        of the Government, and, in this situation, the Department of State in
                        particular, should give an indication to the Congress of its views as to
                        what it would be best for the Government of the United States to do in these
                        premises.</p>
                    <pb n="780" xml:id="pg_780" facs="0790"/>
                    <p>It is believed that with proper guidance from the two agencies best informed
                        on the subject it could be brought about that the Committee on Immigration
                        would produce and submit a bill which, in turn, could be discussed in the
                        two Houses of Congress without arousing a great storm of opposition and with
                        reasonable assurance of passage. Evidence with regard to consideration and
                        discussion of this subject up to date is indicative of failure on the part
                        of those who have expressed themselves in opposition to have considered on
                        the one hand the limitations and safeguards which might be provided and on
                        the other hand the advantages which might be obtained by open minded
                        consideration of and passage of a well conceived bill.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the administration’s leaders in the Congress could
                        without great effort be given, could easily grasp, and could easily impart
                        an exposition of the ins and outs of the subject which would enable the
                        majority to grasp the essential facts and cause them to give their voting
                        support to a committee proposal favored by the administration for a meeting
                        of the needs of the existing situation.</p>
                    <p>What the Chinese want has been well stated in public by Dr. Sze, formerly
                        Minister and Ambassador to this country: “they … desire that they be not
                        denied, as a race, rights that are granted by American law to nearly all the
                        other races of the world. Thus, as regards immigration, the Chinese desire
                        only that they be placed upon the quota basis of the general immigration
                        policy which the United States has established for the coming of foreigners
                        to this country. And, as regards naturalization, the Chinese Government …
                        hopes that those Chinese who desire to become loyal American citizens may be
                        permitted to do so as are permitted the nationals of other countries to do.
                        So far as concerns the entrance of Chinese into this country, the matter has
                        now become almost wholly one of national respect, since the placing of the
                        Chinese upon a quota basis would result in the yearly admission of no more
                        than an additional hundred of them.…”<note n="15" xml:id="d692fn15">Omissions in this paragraph indicated in the original.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>In regard to a formula, there has been made a draft the features of which
                        are: repeal of those provisions of our laws which prohibit expressly and by
                        name immigration of Chinese, and establishment of a quota (which would make
                        possible entry of about 105 persons) for Chinese.—We have intimations to the
                        effect that such an arrangement would be acceptable to Chinese officialdom.
                        And, arrangement of that sort certainly would establish an adequate
                        safeguard against the various evils regarding which opponents thus far of
                        action in this direction have expressed apprehensions.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador called at his request. He took up the matter of
                        securing passage through Congress of a bill to remove the Chinese Exclusion
                        Act and establish a basis of equality of admission into this country in
                        harmony with the treatment accorded nationals of other countries. He said
                        that, while this arrangement would only permit one hundred Chinese to come
                        in, it would establish a principle which would have a good psychological
                        effect on the people of China. I replied that, of course, this Government,
                        as the Ambassador well knows, is sympathetic with any measure on this
                        subject that has any ordinary or reasonably fair chance of being passed by
                        Congress. In other words, I said we do not desire to run the risk of
                        misleading the Chinese and creating serious disappointment among them by
                        publicly getting behind the proposal and representing that the measure has a
                        fair chance of being passed by Congress when we know that its chances are
                        not too good. Therefore, as true friends of China, we are keeping in the
                        closest touch with Congress in the hope that some measure might be developed
                        and passed which will be a step forward in removing the Exclusion Act.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador mentioned a bill introduced by a Congressman from Texas,<note n="16" xml:id="d693fn16">Presumably a reference to H. R. 2942, a bill
                            introduced by Representative Gossett of Texas on June 14, 1943 (78th
                            Cong., 1st sess.), “to reduce immigration and to repeal the Chinese
                            exclusion laws, to place Chinese on a quota basis, and to repeal the
                            laws denying the Chinese the right to become citizens of the United

                        and accordingly he made a request to that effect. I replied that I would be

                        the Department would be glad to do the best possible in the

                        have been introduced into the Congress.</p>
                    <p>The Department of State has been in sympathy with the movement to repeal the
                        Exclusion Act and to include China in the provisions of the Immigration
                            law<note n="19" xml:id="d694fn19">Approved May 26, 1924; 43 Stat.
                            153.</note> under a quota as in the case of other nations with the
                        thought that the immigration to be permitted under the quota would originate
                        in China rather than consist of persons of the Chinese race who had been a
                        long time resident in other countries.</p>
                    <p>Of the bills which have been introduced into the Congress on the general
                        subject, H. R. 3070 and H. R. 2942 seem to more closely approximate the
                        general objective.</p>
                    <p>The Department, however, has been seriously concerned with the possible
                        unfortunate political repercussions upon our friendly relations with China
                        if any of these bills should reach the floor of the House and there be the
                        cause of acrimonious debate, which would in itself be bad, or possibly even
                        suffer defeat—which would be most unfortunate. Consequently, I have caused
                        one of the Assistant Secretaries to keep in very close touch with the
                        leadership of the House as well as to maintain contacts with the leaders of
                        the Senate in this particular. The Assistant Secretary has had a number of
                        conferences with the Speaker, and with the Speaker and Majority Leader, and
                        with both of them and the majority members of the Immigration Committee.</p>
                    <p>There have been public hearings before the Committee on Immigration and
                        Naturalization of the House of Representatives. At the conclusion of the
                        hearings a vote was taken by the Committee. By a vote of nine to eight the
                        Committee adopted a motion which set aside the provisions of a bill to place
                        China upon a quota basis and then voted by the same majority to report out a
                        bill limited to the question of dealing solely with the repeal of the
                        Chinese exclusion laws and the abrogation of the Immigration Treaty of 1880
                        with China<note n="20" xml:id="d694fn20">Signed at Peking, November 17,

                        a quota being established for China or China [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].
                        At about the same time statements were made by certain members of the
                        Congress to officers of the Department indicating that the bills mentioned
                        had little chance of passage.</p>
                    <p>During the early part of the summer the leadership in the House expressed the
                        feeling that caution was an essential part of the program at that time and
                        suggested the impracticability of favorable positive action under the
                        circumstances then existing which circumstances would continue until the
                        beginning of the summer recess. It was <pb n="783" xml:id="pg_783" facs="0793"/>thought at that time it would be advisable to postpone any
                        further consideration of action until after the Congress reconvened.</p>
                    <p>Now that the Congress has reconvened I am causing the matter to be taken up
                        again with the appropriate leaders with the hope that the situation may have
                        changed to such an extent that it will seem to permit favorable
                        consideration, but my deep concern continues to be that a defeat on the
                        floor of the Congress would have a very unfortunate effect upon our
                        relations with the Chinese Government. Almost as unfortunate would be an
                        acrimonious and bitter debate, which might result in passage by a small
                        majority.</p>
                    <p>I shall do what may be possible to further the objective and will be glad to
                        keep you advised.</p>

                    <p>I talked to Speaker Ray burn this morning on the subject of the Chinese
                        immigration bill. He said that it would be up before the Immigration
                        Committee this morning; that it was in good shape before the Committee but
                        that there would be some opposition to it on the floor; that they could
                        easily get a rule out of the Rules Committee; and that he thought it was in
                        good shape, that there would be some opposition to it, and that a letter
                        from the Secretary of State to be used on the floor would be very
                        helpful.</p>
                    <p>I told him that I thought I could assure him that there would be such a
                        letter at the appropriate time and that I would keep in touch with him in
                        regard to it.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Speaker</hi>: As it is understood that H. R.
                        3070 on the subject of Chinese immigration has been reported favorably by
                        the Committee on Immigration and Naturalization and will be discussed
                        shortly on the floor of the House, you may wish to have the views of the
                        Department of State regarding the measure.</p>
                    <pb n="784" xml:id="pg_784" facs="0794"/>
                    <p>Because of the traditional friendship between the United States and China,
                        and because of the many interests which the United States and China now have
                        in common in the prosecution of the war and will have in the future, the
                        Department is most desirous of promoting cordial relations between the two
                        countries.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that it would be most conducive to this end to remove
                        immigration and naturalization discriminations against the Chinese which
                        have been a source of misunderstandings between the United States and China
                        for many years. It will be recalled that the United States has already
                        voluntarily relinquished extraterritorial jurisdiction over American
                        citizens in China.<note n="21" xml:id="d696fn21">See bracketed note, <ref target="#pg_690">p. 690</ref>.</note> This action was most favorably
                        received by the Chinese. It is only fitting that the further step of
                        removing additional discriminations should now be taken in recognition of
                        China’s place among the United Nations fighting for democracy and of her
                        great future in a democratic world.</p>
                    <p>Such recognition cannot fail to give added inspiration to our Chinese allies
                        in their heroic struggle against the enemy seeking to destroy her and to
                        nullify the efforts of this enemy to spread false propaganda regarding the
                        attitude of the United States towards China.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese exclusion laws were enacted prior to the adoption of provisions
                        to restrict immigration by the quota system. By placing the Chinese on a
                        quota, under the system applied to other countries, and by granting rights
                        of naturalization to Chinese admitted lawfully as immigrants,
                        discriminations will be eliminated and China will be accorded the
                        recognition due her as a great nation, subject to such quota immigration
                        restrictions as the Congress may from time to time impose.</p>
                    <p>The Department cannot urge too strongly that it is the part of sound
                        practical policy to eliminate discriminations which, unless removed, tend to
                        impede this country in its relations with China during the war period and
                        afterwards in the development of trade and cultural intercourse.</p>
                    <p>It is also the part of far-seeing wisdom to make manifest in this way our
                        traditional friendship with China, the great country of the Orient whose
                        destiny is to participate equally with other democratic nations in fostering
                        a civilization based upon democratic ideals and to stand as a bulwark
                        against evil forces of destruction.</p>

                        Act which while otherwise unobjectionable closed with a statement regarding
                        future Sino-American collaboration which is translated as follows: “Whether

                        shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand undertake the mission of this great

                    <p>Tong later called on me and expressed regret at publication of editorial

                    <p>I told Tong we sometimes report summaries of editorials for information of

               </p>
                    <p>Recently two incidents have occurred in New York harbor involving the killing
                        or serious injury of members of Chinese crews on board foreign vessels who
                        were attempting to land, allegedly in contravention of American immigration
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>On April 11, 1942, according to press reports, the Chinese crew on board a
                        foreign vessel in New York harbor threatened the captain of the vessel
                        because of his refusal to permit the crew to land and the captain fired,
                        killing one of the Chinese crew. The vessel in question had left Singapore
                        in September and had been lying in New York harbor since November, the crew
                        being permitted one shore leave apiece in the interval. The captain
                        reportedly stated that immigration regulations forbade the crew from going
                        ashore and that the steamship company would be heavily fined if the Chinese
                        crew were permitted to land.</p>
                    <p>On June 4, 1942, according to press reports, two Chinese seamen from a
                        freighter in New York harbor were shot and seriously wounded by a steamship
                        company guard, when they, with other members of the crew, attempted to force
                        their way ashore after permission to leave the pier had been refused. After
                        the shooting, the crew was forced back to its ship at pistol point.</p>
                    <p>The following comment upon these incidents is offered:</p>
                            <p>1. According to information from IN,<note n="1" xml:id="d701fn1">Division of International Communications.</note> there is no
                                legal provision barring the landing for shore leave of properly
                                documented, bona fide Chinese seamen, and there is no discrimination
                                by American authorities against such seamen. According to the
                                regulations of November 19, 1941, as amended on January 14, 1942
                                regarding aliens entering the United States (Section 58.54), “in
                                addition to all other requirements, no non-resident alien seaman
                                employed on any vessel <pb n="789" xml:id="pg_789" facs="0799"/>arriving in the United States from any place outside thereof shall
                                be granted shore leave or be permitted to go ashore in the United
                                States except with the approval of the master and in the discretion
                                of the immigration officials at the port of arrival acting under
                                authority of the Attorney-General …”<note n="2" xml:id="d701fn2">Omission indicated in the original.</note> It therefore appears
                                that wide discretion in the matter is left with the masters and the
                                immigration officials and it is probable, according to IN, that the
                                documents of Chinese seamen might be more carefully scrutinized by
                                immigration officials than are the documents of seamen of
                                non-Oriental races.</p>
                            <p>2. Although from a strictly technical point of view there may be
                                    no discrimination against Chinese crews on vessels in American
                                    ports, it is evident, from the circumstances of the two
                                    incidents referred to and from press comment that Chinese crews
                                    on one basis or another are denied over long periods the right
                                    to land even for shore leave and that the opinion is prevalent
                                    that practical discrimination against Chinese crews does exist
                                    on a wide scale.</p>
                                <p>Such a situation is evidently undesirable for humanitarian
                                    reasons; for political reasons, because China is a United Nation
                                    and because the Axis is seeking for material to create the
                                    impression in the Far East that the “four freedoms” are
                                    meaningless and that the United States is racially prejudiced
                                    against all Oriental peoples; and for strategic reasons because
                                    an adequate supply of loyal seamen who are willing to take the
                                    risks of shipping on freighters and tankers is vital to the
                                    maintenance of our supply lines and to the success of the
                                    war.</p>
                            <p>3. It is recognized that any efforts to ameliorate this situation
                                must take into account several important factors, including the
                                following: <list>

                                        Chinese seamen as a group are paid lower wages and given
                                        less endurable living conditions than are other crews.
                                        Moreover, under existing conditions, Chinese seamen can have

                                        landing of such persons if there is any reason to believe
                                        that the seamen may jump ship.</item>

                                    Hsueh-fan, has stated, according to the press, “that ship
                                    desertions by all nationalities had assumed grave proportions”,
                                    that there were about 10,000 deserting seamen at large in the
                                    United States, and that statistics for New York harbor for March
                                    showed that Chinese desertions represented only 16% of the total
                                    desertions for the period.</p>

                            <p>5. In the light of all these considerations, it is suggested that if
                                a serious study of the situation of Chinese seamen in American ports
                                has not already been begun, it should be urgently undertaken with a
                                view to establishing fully the facts and considering what steps
                                might reasonably be taken toward improvement. Question is raised: <list>

                    <p>As directed by you, I called a meeting some time ago of Mr. Falck of IN, Mr.
                        Flournoy of LE,<note n="3" xml:id="d702fn3">Office of the Legal

                        office, to consider the question of the treatment of Chinese seamen arriving
                        in American ports. Mr. Falck informed us that representatives of the War
                        Shipping Administration were having conferences with the Immigration
                        officials to determine <pb n="791" xml:id="pg_791" facs="0801"/>what steps
                        might be taken to insure better treatment for Chinese seamen and avoidance
                        of incidents such as the shooting of Chinese seamen who attempted to go
                        ashore at New York in April last after having been refused shore leave for a
                        long time while the vessel was in port. Mr. Burke of IN sent me the attached
                        memorandum on July 21,<note n="6" xml:id="d702fn6">Not printed.</note>
                        stating the results of the conferences of the War Shipping and Immigration
                        officials on the subject. It appears therefrom that shore leave privileges
                        for Chinese seamen are to be equalized with those for other alien seamen on
                        a trial basis for two months, that the British and Dutch have increased
                        wages for Chinese seamen to practically a parity with the wages of other
                        seamen and that several other measures, as indicated in Mr. Burke’s
                        memorandum, have been taken to ameliorate the situation of Chinese seamen.
                        So far as I can see, all that is practicable and possible for the time being
                        has been done accordingly in behalf of Chinese seamen. You may wish to send

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Fiorello</hi>: I wonder if you could lend a hand on
                        something that is worrying us.</p>
                    <p>We have had seamen deserting from Allied ships, and have cleaned up the
                        situation in one way or another. We are now down to the last main problem
                        which is that of the Chinese seamen. They desert pretty regularly. They are
                        mainly employed on British ships. The pay is not equal to the British but
                        under some help from us, it is not very far away from it. The British seamen
                        get $72 per month; the Chinese $68.</p>
                    <p>The Immigration people report that the real reason for desertion is that they
                        are wanted for labor in Chinatown where wages are higher than on British
                        ships, especially as labor gets increasingly tight. The Chinese Consul
                        General in New York probably is standing in with the restaurant keepers and
                        laundrymen who are the principal employers of these deserting seamen.</p>
                    <p>Marshall Dimock of the War Shipping Administration thinks that something
                        could be done if we could rally the Chinese in Chinatown and have them lend
                        a hand in sending the sailors back to work. Since the Chinese Consul General
                        can’t help, this means we should have to <pb n="792" xml:id="pg_792" facs="0802"/>find somebody familiar with the community who was in
                        sympathy with the war and would lend a hand. Do you think that you or the
                        Police Department or anyone up there could suggest a way to begin?</p>
                    <p>The subject is important. There are four ships presently held up in New York
                        harbor because part of their Chinese crews have deserted; and almost without
                        exception these ships are carrying supplies and troops to our own boys in
                        North Africa.</p>
                    <p>The only other alternative is to go at it hammer and tongs and allow no
                        Chinese crews ashore, which probably would get results, and incidentally
                        make very bad feeling with Chungking.</p>
                    <p>You may have some ways to suggest that would help us to get the Chinese
                        community in New York to look into this.</p>

                    <p rend="flushleft">Att: Hon. A. A. Berle, Assistant Secretary of State</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have a communication from
                        the Department of State dated January 1 [<hi rend="italic">4</hi>], 1943,
                        requesting that I “lend a hand” in the deserting Chinese seamen situation.
                        As always, I am happy to be of assistance to the Department of State
                        although I do not enjoy extra-territoriality which, perhaps, would solve
                        this problem very easily.</p>
                    <p>Frankly, there are two sides to this question, and something must be done to
                        protect Chinese seamen shipping on foreign vessels. I am convinced that the
                        British Government is not only concerned but really intends to protect
                        Chinese seamen shipping on British ships. The fact is, however, that either
                        agencies of the Government or private steamship companies have been guilty
                        of the most unpardonable and cruel treatment of these men. In the first
                        place, there are instances where no record is taken of the seaman’s next of
                        kin, and therefore apparent that there is no intent to pay such next of kin
                        the war risk compensation in the event of death. Then, another point which I
                        believe is justified: there should be no difference in allowance made for
                        death compensation between seamen. If these men ship on British ships, they
                        should get the same death benefits as are given to any other seamen on the
                        same ship.</p>
                    <p>As you state, the compensation has been fixed for an ordinary seaman at $68 a
                        month, but most of the deserters in this port have never received <pb n="793" xml:id="pg_793" facs="0803"/>that rate of pay. What is more,
                        many of them have pay coming to them and are unable to collect. The
                        treatment on board ship of Chinese seamen is quite different from that of
                        others and it goes without saying that in this day and age everyone on the
                        ship should be treated alike.</p>
                    <p>I had a conference in my office at which Mr. Marshall E. Dimock of the U. S.
                        War Shipping Administration sat in. At this conference, I invited
                        representatives of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, various fraternal
                        organizations, businessmen and representatives of the Chinese press. Mr.
                        Dimock was most helpful and forthright. Many of the complaints he
                        acknowledged were justified. Confidentially, a threat of a round-up with
                        subsequent internment would be far more preferable to these Chinese seamen
                        than going back to their ships under the old conditions. Our local Chinese
                        residents are willing to cooperate but something must be done to protect the
                        rights of these men if they are really wanted and needed back on the ships.
                        As I have said, internment is paradise to the hell that they have gone
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Cases were cited of men whose ships had been torpedoed, and were saved, on
                        coming out of the hospital and being brought to New York, were given $5, and
                        unable to collect their past due pay.</p>
                    <p>To come to the point, I have suggested the following plan, and I am sure that
                        we will get full cooperation from our own Chinese residents and from the men
                        themselves: <list>

                                Shipping Administration which will see that the rights of these men
                                are fully protected. Mr. Dimock agrees to this.</item>

                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>Therefore, may I suggest that the matter be taken up with British
                        authorities, and on receipt of the assurance above indicated, I think we can
                        get the whole matter in operation. The necessity of the reforms suggested is
                        not only to care for the four hundred odd deserters now in this port, but to
                        make certain that the several thousand Chinese seamen now on British ships
                        will not desert on arriving at an American or friendly port.</p>
                    <p>I await your pleasure in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely yours,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Fiorello</hi>: Let me thank you for your courteous
                        letter of January 18, 1943 and for your generous assistance in connection
                        with the deserting Chinese sailors.</p>
                    <p>The War Shipping Administration which was represented at your conference is,
                        as I understand, fully informed as to the proposed plan. We have asked them
                        to work out the plan with the British, as they are in continuous and direct
                        touch with the British shipping authorities. We shall hope to get some
                        results.</p>
                    <p>As you accurately state, the real consideration is to make certain that
                        approximately 10,000 Chinese seamen now on British ships will not desert
                        when they arrive at an American port.</p>
                    <p>The Department is obliged to you for your intervention.</p>
                    <p>With kind regards [etc.]</p>

                    <p>The Chinese seaman problem which has existed for many years has been further
                        complicated during the past several months by our relationship to China as a
                        United Nation. Low wages paid by other United Nations to Chinese seamen and
                        this Government’s denial of shore leave to such seamen were considered to be
                        the factors which to a large extent caused the discontent amounting
                        sometimes to riot among Chinese seamen.</p>
                    <p>The British, Norwegian and Netherlands Governments raised the wages of
                        Chinese seamen almost to the level of white seamen and this Government in
                        August 1942 removed temporarily the shore-leave barriers so that Chinese
                        were allowed to come ashore during the periods that their ships were in
                        port.</p>
                    <p>According to Mr. Smith Simpson, Chief of the Allied Nations Division of the
                        War Shipping Administration, the experiment has worked fairly well excepting
                        in New York. There was at first trouble in San Francisco also but for the
                        last two or three months the situation has been satisfactory.</p>

                    <p>There are at present approximately 250 Chinese seamen detained by immigration
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Simpson stated that on Saturday, January 16, Mr. Dimock of the
                        Recruitment and Manning Organization, went to New York and discussed the
                        situation with Mayor LaGuardia who offered to bring together Chinese
                        businessmen he knew and lay the problem before them. The Mayor gave the
                        Chinese twenty-one days to solve the problem. They promised to do everything
                        they could.</p>
                    <p>It was also learned that a detained Chinese seaman at New York who entered
                        the United States in 1941 is bringing suit under writ of habeas corpus
                        contending that since he cannot be deported to China, he should not be held
                        indefinitely. The District Attorney has taken the stand that a seaman,
                        according to immigration laws, may be deported to the country from which he
                        last came and that the “country from which he last came” may be the country
                        where he signed on a ship. In a large number of cases this would be England.
                        Therefore, if it is found that seamen may be deported to the country where
                        they signed on a vessel, legislative action may not be necessary.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that Chinese seamen who desert and disappear in New York or San
                        Francisco are hindering rather than helping the war effort and the threat of
                        deporting them to Great Britain might be an effective influence. On the
                        other hand, it has been stated that Chinese seamen cause little or no
                        trouble on American or Panamanian ships which pay higher wages. Whether this
                        Government should pass legislation encouraging practices by other nations to
                        which we ourselves do not subscribe and which are at the expense of other
                        United Nations citizens should be given very careful consideration.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador and his aides and the Attorney General met in my
                        office, at the suggestion of the Attorney General. The purpose was to see
                        whether the Chinese Ambassador would make any objection to the text of the
                        proposed amendment to the Immigration Act.<note n="8" xml:id="d707fn8">Approved May 26, 1924; 43 Stat. 153.</note> The purport of the
                        amendment was to permit the Department of Justice to deport alien seamen who
                        had illegally entered the United States, to the country of the flag of the
                        ship in which they came, where it was impracticable to deport them to their
                        own country. The effect of this would be to permit deportation of deserting
                        Chinese seamen to Britain, because practically all such desertions are from
                        British ships. As deserting Chinese seamen cannot be deported to China,
                        without such an amendment in practice they remain here.</p>
                    <p>I began by stating the case, pointing out that the Embassy was thoroughly
                        familiar with the problem, on which they had been working for months with
                        the War Shipping Administration. We had hoped, by ameliorating the lot of
                        the Chinese seamen, to reduce the desertion rate, and the Chinese Government
                        had agreed to try to discourage desertions. As a result, the Chinese seamen
                        were now very nearly on a parity with the British seamen, and arrangements
                        were being made for their welfare here. Yet the desertions were continuing,
                        and since the men could not be deported, it was necessary to change the law.
                        In previous contacts, I pointed out, the Embassy had not taken a
                        position.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General thereupon explained the text and drift of the proposed
                        amendment.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador said that this was a difficult problem which they
                        wished to regard as a whole, and that it had many phases. Particularly, he
                        said that the War Shipping Administration had now promised to the Chinese
                        Government a number of liberty ships, two of which might be delivered in the
                        not distant future. Some 600 seamen had deserted and they could be used as
                        crews on the ships. The real issue, he said, was not so much equality of pay
                        as treatment <pb n="797" xml:id="pg_797" facs="0807"/>by the British
                        officers. He thought that with patience a solution could be reached,
                        especially after the liberty ships were delivered since Chinese seamen could
                        then be used on Chinese ships.</p>
                    <p>I said at once that I did not think this Government could permit the question
                        of liberty ships to be connected with the problem of handling deserting
                        seamen. As the Ambassador knew, there were many thousand Chinese seamen on
                        British ships. If the theory was that they could leave the British ships and
                        await the delivery of American ships to China, the net result would be to
                        tie up a British ship for every liberty ship furnished the Chinese. Plainly,
                        this would gravely handicap the war effort.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador made a second attempt to tie up the question of delivery of
                        ships to China with the problem of dealing with deserting seamen, and got no
                        encouragement from the Attorney General or from me. He evaded taking a clear
                        position on the proposed amendment, bringing in the various grievances
                        against British officers, and saying that the knowledge that Chinese seamen
                        might be deported to Britain would, in his opinion, increase rather than
                        decrease the difficulty.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General then made a brief statement. He said he hoped the
                        Ambassador would realize that it was very unusual to consult a foreign
                        embassy in a matter of domestic legislation. He had asked this meeting
                        because of the very great consideration they had for the Chinese Government
                        and for the views of the Embassy, and because he did not wish it to be
                        thought that any step was being taken to discriminate against the Chinese.
                        He pointed out that the Department of Justice had taken the lead in
                        endeavoring to ameliorate the position of the Chinese seamen when Mr.
                        Marshall Dimock had worked on these matters; and had achieved a very
                        considerable degree of success. As the situation now stood, every other
                        seaman could be deported to England. The text of the amendment did not set
                        up a special category for Chinese, since it applied to any seaman who could
                        not be deported to his native country; it applied not merely to Chinese but
                        to Swedes, Finns and Russians.</p>
                    <p>Answering a point that the Ambassador had made, namely, that in the case of
                        other seamen deportation to England meant deportation to a country in which
                        their governments-in-exile were situated, the Attorney General pointed out
                        that this was not true of Swedes, Finns and Russians since none of them had
                        governments-in-exile in Britain.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that the Chinese could be deported to China by way of
                        Karachi. I interposed that this would not help much, since Chinese seamen
                        were guilty of desertion under British law and would be picked up at Karachi
                        before they ever got to China.</p>
                    <pb n="798" xml:id="pg_798" facs="0808"/>
                    <p>The Counselor of Embassy inquired whether there were not maritime courts of
                        countries having governments-in-exile in Britain, so that the seamen would
                        then be tried in a maritime court of their own country. I answered that I
                        was not wholly clear about the jurisdiction of maritime courts, but my
                        understanding was that they had jurisdiction only over offenses committed
                        on, or in respect of, ships of their own flag. A Norwegian seaman committing
                        an offense on a Norwegian ship would be tried by a Norwegian maritime court.
                        But if he deserted from a British ship he would be tried in a British court
                        under British law. By consequence, the question of maritime courts did not
                        seem to me to be relevant.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador repeated somewhat vaguely his hope that an all around solution
                        could be found, and said he would study the text and let us know.</p>
                    <p>The Attorney General emphasized the desire for speed. He pointed out that the
                        War Shipping Administration was pressing for the legislation, and that the
                        only effect of it was to restore a situation which had existed until a
                        couple of habeas corpus cases had been decided, restricting the power of the
                        Immigration authorities. Finally, he said that in situations of this kind
                        they wanted not only to right the grievances of the seamen, but also to
                        provide some method by which a satisfactory solution could be had.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">My Dear Mr. Berle</hi>: I was glad to have the
                        opportunity yesterday of discussing with you and the Attorney General the
                        question of deportation of Chinese seamen in the United States. I have since
                        carefully considered the matter and I feel that the position in which
                        Chinese nationals now find themselves calls for special consideration from
                        the standpoint of law enforcement in that they are prevented by
                        circumstances of war to return to their own country. If they are made
                        deportable to a third country contrary to the accepted practice of returning
                        them to the country of origin, they are in fact made to suffer the
                        consequences of <hi rend="italic">force majeure</hi> and subjected to less
                        favorable treatment than in normal times.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the question of Chinese seamen in general, I wish to assure you
                        that the Chinese Government is most anxious to collaborate with the United
                        States Government to find a satisfactory solution <pb n="799" xml:id="pg_799" facs="0809"/>and is taking steps in that direction.
                        While I am able to appreciate the position taken by the Attorney General, I
                        regret that I cannot subscribe to the course of action as contemplated in
                        the proposed bill of amendment regarding deportation of aliens.</p>
                    <p>I shall be obliged if you will be so good as to convey to the Attorney
                        General the above observations and my appreciation of his courtesy in
                        affording me the opportunity of discussing the matter with him.</p>

                    <p>I attended the executive session of the House Committee on Immigration and
                        Naturalization. The hearing concerned an amendment to the immigration law
                        permitting deportation of deserting seamen to the country of the vessel on
                        which they had signed articles where they could not be deported to their own
                        countries. In practice this means Chinese seamen.</p>
                    <p>The Maritime Commission took the laboring oar in urging the
                        amendment—pointing out, among other things, that four ships actually
                        carrying troops and supplies to North Africa had been held up by desertion,
                        and that something had to be done about it. The Department of Justice joined
                        in that view, though less strongly. When they got through, the committee
                        asked the views of the Department. I said that we had given prayerful
                        consideration to this. We wished to give the utmost recognition to the
                        Chinese case. The real difficulty was that the Chinese sailors objected to
                        working under British masters (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) because the wages
                        and conditions were discriminatory, and (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) because
                        there was a feeling of race prejudice.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that during the past year we had worked with the British until
                        the inequalities of pay, treatment, etc., were substantially removed. The
                        race difference of course nobody could remove save through a long process of
                        education.</p>
                    <p>I pointed out that the case of Chinese seamen was exactly the same as the
                        case of all Allied seamen—many of whom had wished to desert here to get
                        higher pay on American ships or in American munitions factories or to make
                        illegal entry into the United States. We had virtually stopped this by
                        removal of grievances and by deportation. In effect, therefore, the Chinese
                        were now in a privileged position. This, of course, combined with the delay
                        to our own ships, created a difficult situation.</p>
                    <pb n="800" xml:id="pg_800" facs="0810"/>
                    <p>I said that we had finally come to the conclusion that first things came
                        first; that from the finding of facts as the Maritime Commission had stated
                        them, namely, that our war effort was being jeopardized, we were forced to
                        agree that the position taken by the Maritime Commission was right. Unless
                        there was a victory, the Chinese worries about discrimination would cease to
                        exist and the Nazis and the Japanese would do it for them. Further, the
                        matter was, in essence, one of our own domestic law.</p>
                    <p>But, I said, the clauses drawn gave administrative discretion to the Attorney
                        General. The Department of Justice had very courteously and faithfully
                        worked with us in these matters in completest harmony. Both Justice and we
                        agreed that the most sympathetic and favorable administration of the law was
                        indicated, so that the Chinese position should be preserved up to the
                        limit.</p>
                    <p>I noted that the Chinese had themselves agreed that there should be no
                        desertions and were really embarrassed by their lack of ability to control
                        their own men.</p>
                    <p>At the close of the testimony, the sole objector on the committee withdrew
                        his objection. I gather, therefore, that the amendment will have the
                        unanimous support of the committee, or at least of those members
                        present.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador came in to see me at his request. He referred to the
                        legislation which the Maritime Commission had been sponsoring in respect to
                        permitting deportation of Chinese seamen to the country of the registry of
                        their ship, where they cannot be deported to their own country. He said that
                        some indication had been given by Representative Halleck in the House of
                        Representatives that the Chinese Embassy had consented to this, whereas they
                        had not. I said I would endeavor to see what could be done and that I was
                        unable to see how a misunderstanding could arise, since when we had been
                        asked on the point by the House Committee, it had been made very clear that
                        the Chinese Embassy, if asked, undoubtedly would not assent.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said that this was a difficult business. They wanted to
                        remove any discrimination as between British and Chinese seamen, after which
                        they thought that the government would be in a stronger position to prevent
                        desertions. But now only a narrow margin remained between the pay given to
                        Chinese seamen and to British seamen and he thought that there was no real
                        reason why the British Government, having taken a big step, should not take
                        a little one. I told him that, as he knew, our steady policy had been to
                        remove any discrimination, and indeed it was due to that that the
                        discrepancy had been in a large measure removed. I said that as to the
                        larger plans the Maritime Commission could not get itself into a position
                        where Chinese seamen could desert without danger of deportation when every
                        other seaman in the world had the same privilege.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he realized that we are in a difficult position as
                        between the British and the Chinese Government, but he hoped for a general
                        solution which might be helpful to the whole situation.</p>

                            statement was that the Chinese Government’s bargaining power as against
                            British would <pb n="802" xml:id="pg_802" facs="0812"/>be diminished if
                            we enforced against the Chinese laws similar to those enforced against
                            all other seamen. I am told that the Chinese Ambassador has made this
                            point in conversation with the people of the Maritime Commission. We
                            have endeavored to be cautious, lest the Chinese play the liberality of
                            our laws against the British.</p>

                                of certain aliens” can only work to the benefit of the Chinese

                        morning of April 14 and said that he understood that the legislation
                        relating to the deportation of seamen might be expected to be passed by
                        Congress shortly. In view of the urgency of the matter, he said, the Chinese
                        Embassy hoped that the State Department would do whatever it could to effect
                        an amendment or change in the legislation in so far as it pertained to
                        Chinese seamen. Mr. Tsui said that the Embassy regarded the legislation as
                        unfair to Chinese seamen. He mentioned that the Chinese Ambassador was in
                        New York at the moment.</p>

                    <p>In connection with the question of the Chinese seamen, there was held in Mr.
                        Long’s office yesterday a meeting at which there was lengthy discussion of
                        the question what should be the attitude and the procedure of the Department
                        in the presence of there being pending in Congress legislation and there
                        having been received from the Chinese Embassy expressions of objection

                    <p>This morning there came addressed to PA/H and to FE a memorandum<note n="12" xml:id="d714fn12">Not found in Department files.</note> by Mr. Long to
                        the effect that, in as much as matters relating to this question had been
                        handled by Mr. Berle, he, Mr. Long, wished to refrain from action or
                        participation in action regarding this subject and to have the handling of
                        the matter remain with Mr. Berle.</p>
                    <p>This afternoon I spoke to Mr. Long about this. He said that he had spoken
                        with Mr. Berle about it and that he had expressed to Mr. Berle the opinion
                        that FE should be consulted.</p>
                    <p>For purposes of record, it needs to be stated that, although FE and PA/H have
                        been consulted at some points regarding some features of this case, those
                        offices were not consulted regarding and had no knowledge of the letter
                        which went, over the signature of the Under Secretary, to Senator Russell
                        under date of March 10 and that the representations which the Chinese
                        Ambassador has made regarding this matter have been made directly to the
                        Secretary and to Mr. Berle, whereas certain inquiries emanating from the
                        Chinese Ambassador have been brought by a junior officer of the Embassy to
                        FE.</p>
                    <p>Further for purposes of the record, it is the opinion of Messrs. Hamilton,
                        Hiss and Hornbeck that the probably most expedient course which the American
                        Government might pursue at this stage, from point of view of U. S. relations
                        with China and U. S. relations with Great Britain would be to have the
                        proposed legislation held in suspense and let further appropriate efforts be
                        made to cause the British Government to raise the pay of Chinese seamen to
                        equality with the pay of British seamen serving on British vessels and to
                        bring about the return of Chinese seamen to the vessels on which they come

                    <p>Sir Arthur Salter<note n="13" xml:id="d715fn13">Of the British Merchant
                            Shipping Mission.</note> came in to see me, at my request.</p>
                    <p>I said that he doubtless was aware of the state of the record in connection
                        with the amendment to the Immigration Act. This permits deportation of
                        deserting Chinese seamen, as well as other aliens, who cannot be deported to
                        the country of which they are nationals.</p>
                    <p>I said, as he knew, the bill having been passed by the House and the Senate
                        was now lying over on a motion to reconsider by Senator LaFollette.</p>
                    <pb n="805" xml:id="pg_805" facs="0815"/>
                    <p>Sir Arthur said that he had followed the bill closely and knew the
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>I then said that the Chinese Ambassador had presented a protest—a rather mild
                        one to me, and a stronger one to the Secretary. We had this before us. I
                        said that the ground for this protest was that Chinese seamen ought not to
                        be deported, under these circumstances; and that the real issue was equality
                        of treatment as between Chinese seamen and British seamen, serving on
                        British boats. The actual difference in treatment between the two seemed not
                        to be great; and I wished to inquire whether steps could not be taken
                        quickly to equalize the difference.</p>
                    <p>I said that this seemed to me the only way of avoiding debate on the bill,
                        which probably would consist in airing Chinese grievances against the
                        British, and so forth—which would not be helpful in the general
                        situation.</p>
                    <p>Sir Arthur said that he likewise had been considering the matter. He said
                        that he had an opportunity to approach T. V. Soong<note n="14" xml:id="d715fn14">Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs, temporarily in
                            the United States.</note> on the matter; and that he proposed to do so
                        in conjunction with Lord Halifax.<note n="15" xml:id="d715fn15">British
                            Ambassador in the United States.</note> He outlined a strictly personal
                        idea as to how the matter might be handled, which, however, he asked me not
                        to record, because he said that it was merely his personal idea and he had
                        not cleared it with his Government.</p>
                    <p>I told him that I thought that the bill would lie in its present stage for
                        ten days or two weeks, but probably not longer than that.</p>
                    <p>Sir Arthur said that he would keep me advised. I told him likewise that I
                        would give him, for his confidential information, a copy of the protest
                        which the Chinese had presented to us. I said that, plainly, we were in
                        between, in a problem chiefly between the British and the Chinese.</p>
                    <p>Sir Arthur said that he realized this. He said, further, that they were
                        concerned about two aspects of the matter. One was that the Chinese were in
                        the position of having broken their contract and then asking for
                        negotiations to revise it. Nevertheless, Sir Arthur was prepared to
                        recommend waiving this feature and entering into negotiations with Soong.
                        The other aspect was that while they were prepared to equate with the
                        Chinese, they did not wish this to be used as forcing the British to equate
                        their pay to the pay of all other United Nations seamen. He said that
                        practically every nation when it came into the war had more or less frozen
                        seamen’s pay. The rates of pay largely reflected the date when the various
                        countries had come into the war; since, between the time when Britain
                        entered the war and the time when the other nations were attacked, their
                        shipping had had the <pb n="806" xml:id="pg_806" facs="0816"/>benefit of
                        very high wartime earnings, which were reflected somewhat in the seamen’s
                        rate. He hoped it would be understood, therefore, that by endeavoring to
                        equate with the Chinese this would not be used as a lever to force them to
                        bring the British wage standard up to the standard of other countries.</p>
                    <p>He explained in some detail the technical difficulties about equating the
                        British pay scale with the Chinese. The Chinese seamen get two months’ bonus
                        at the end of each year; whereas the British do not. The British pay
                        insurance and otherwise pay for their own medical treatment; the Chinese pay
                        no insurance and get free medical treatment. The British pay their expenses
                        while ashore; the Chinese have their expenses paid for them. These, he said,
                        would take more than ten days’ time to work out; but he thought that a
                        method might be worked out which would resolve the present debate.</p>
                    <p>I said I was glad he felt he could tackle it.</p>

                        told me that he believed that a satisfactory agreement would be reached in
                        the immediate future, and that all the Chinese Government was endeavoring to
                        obtain was the establishment of the principle of equality of treatment to be
                        accorded Chinese seamen—not from the standpoint of pounds and shillings, but
                        in the abstract. He asked if I would request you, consequently, to see if
                        the pending legislation in the Senate could not be delayed in view of the
                        probability that an agreement would soon be reached.</p>

                    <p>The matter of deserting Chinese seamen and legislation to rectify the
                        situation seems now to be settled.</p>
                    <p>The British and the Chinese agreed on a joint statement which they issued
                        yesterday (copy attached<note n="19" xml:id="d719fn19">
                     <hi rend="italic">Supra.</hi>
                  </note>). It says in substance that the two Governments
                        have agreed with regard to terms and conditions of employment.</p>
                    <p>On this basis, the Congress has passed legislation<note n="20" xml:id="d719fn20">Approved July 13, 1943; 57 Stat. 553.</note>
                        permitting deportation of Chinese seamen to India. While the legislation is
                        not wholly satisfactory, it does permit the Department of Justice to deport
                        Chinese seamen—via England if necessary, according to Justice—and they say
                        they will do this.</p>
                    <p>All hands having agreed, there seems to be nothing further for us to do in
                        the matter and we can consider it closed—unless of course the Chinese
                        continue to desert.</p>
                    <p>T. V. Soong has indicated he will endeavor to withdraw the Chinese Consul in
                        New York who has not been helpful in the matter.</p>

                    <p>1364. Please communicate the following to General Stilwell and transmit his
                        reply to the Department:</p>
                    <p>Agreement has been reached between British, Indian and Chinese governments
                        for deportation from United States to Ramgarh, India with a view to their
                        conscription into Chinese armed forces of Chinese seamen who have deserted
                        their ships in United States ports. Proposed arrangements are in accordance
                        with the recent law passed by Congress to amend United States immigration
                        law in respect of deportation of alien seamen. The agreement of the Indian
                        government is subject to following conditions: (1) Individuals deported to
                        India must be of sufficiently high medical category to permit of their
                        acceptance in the Chinese Army; (2) No individual whose history is doubtful
                        from point of view of security should be sent to India; (3) Assurance should
                        be given to the Indian Government before the first <pb n="810" xml:id="pg_810" facs="0820"/>party of Chinese deserters leaves a United
                        States port that definite orders have been sent to Ramgarh to provide a
                        Chinese military escort for the deserters on their arrival in India and to
                        escort them from the port of arrival to Ramgarh; (4) Deserters should be
                        sent in batches of twenty-five to thirty-five at a time under intimation to
                        the Government of India.</p>
                    <p>Since the Chinese armed forces at Ramgarh are under your orders the
                        Department would be grateful if you would advise whether the arrangements
                        and the conditions proposed by the Indian government are acceptable to you
                        and in particular whether you can give assurance that arrangements will be
                        made to provide Chinese military escorts at the port of arrival in India,
                        and how much advance notice you will require. An early reply would be
                        appreciated.</p>

                        Stilwell by letter September 28th. He replied under date of September 30th
                        giving his personal views as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“My experience with deserting seamen in India has not encouraged me
                                to ask for more of them. We have our hands full without any extra
                                complication and a man who will desert his ship will desert from the
                                army. The reputation of the Chinese in India has to be carefully
                                guarded since the British do not want them there anyway and an
                                element of this type is sure to cause us trouble. I have had no
                                information or instructions from the Chinese Government about the
                                matter but if it is already settled, I have no choice but to accept
                                it. I do not approve of the arrangement and believe it would be
                                simpler and better for all concerned to put them into a
                                concentration camp in the United States for the duration.”</p>

                        1851, October 4, 9 a.m., to receive deserting Chinese seamen into the forces
                        under his command, it is suggested that you discuss this matter with Dr.
                        Soong, who is thoroughly familiar with the <pb n="811" xml:id="pg_811" facs="0821"/>problem, and explore the possibility of the Chinese making
                        some other arrangement for looking after deserting Chinese seamen who may be
                        deported from this country to India.</p>

                        in question had been approved personally by the Generalissimo and he would
                        have to take the matter up with the General to see if another solution could

                    <p>1567. With reference to the problem of the disposition of deserting Chinese
                        seamen upon their deportation and arrival in India referred to in Embassy’s
                        2008, October 23, 9 a.m., War Shipping Administration desires to know
                        whether these men will be transferred upon debarkation in India to the
                        Chinese unit at Ramgarh. War Shipping Administration states it is anxious to
                        deport 20 or 25 deserters in accordance with provisions of legislation
                        recently enacted by Congress and agreement between the Chinese, British, and
                        ourselves, and that failure to take such action would seriously aggravate
                        this problem.</p>

                    <p>2141. Department’s 1567, November 1. Soong informed me November 9 he had
                        discussed matter with Generalissimo and suggested that if Stilwell did not
                        want the seamen at Ramgarh they be flown to Kunming for induction there into
                        Chinese army; Soong said there should not be many seamen involved—all that
                        was needed was a gesture <pb n="812" xml:id="pg_812" facs="0822"/>and there
                        would be no further desertions. After further discussion with Stilwell’s
                        headquarters we are now informed that, rather than use plane space for even
                        one or two batches, Stilwell prefers to accept the antagonist [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] batch of deserters at Ramgarh and will require a
                        week or 10 days’ notice of their arrival at debarkation point in order to
                        arrange for Chinese military escort suggested by penultimate sentence

                    <p>During the course of a call Dr. Liu Chieh<note n="1" xml:id="d727fn1">Minister Counselor of the Chinese Embassy.</note> brought to my
                        attention the situation of Chinese students in the United States under
                        Selective Service requirements. Dr. Liu said that last May an arrangement
                        had been worked out with the Selective Service whereby foreign students in
                        the United States were exempted from military service in as much as such
                        students were not regarded as residents of the United States. More recently,
                        Dr. Liu said, an increasing number of students were writing to the Chinese
                        Embassy reporting that local draft boards were asking them to call and the
                        local draft boards were showing greater reluctance to continue to regard
                        Chinese students as exempted from induction into the United States Army. Dr.
                        Liu said that at times the Embassy took cases up with the Selective Service,
                        that this was a somewhat cumbersome procedure, that in some cases exemptions
                        had been granted by Selective Service up to June 30 of this year, but that
                        the prospect of exemption after that time seemed to be less than it had been
                        heretofore.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu said that according to an item in the press of several months ago an
                        agreement had been made between this Government and the Mexican Government
                        whereby Mexican students in the United States were exempted from Selective
                            Service.<note n="2" xml:id="d727fn2">Probably a reference to article III

                            Agreement Series No. 323, or 57 Stat. 973.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu said that a few days ago the Chinese Embassy had received an
                        instruction from the Chinese Government to take up with this Department the
                        situation of Chinese students in the United States with a view to concluding
                        some arrangement similar to that made between this Government and the
                        Mexican Government whereby Chinese students in this country would continue
                        to be exempted from Selective Service.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu emphasized that Chinese students pursuing their education in this
                        country were in the eyes of the Chinese Government doing <pb n="814" xml:id="pg_814" facs="0824"/>something which was quite important from
                        point of view of China’s war effort and the reconstruction period that would
                        follow the war. Dr. Liu pointed out that a course of study which to this
                        Government might not seem to be related directly to the war effort might be
                        so related in the eyes of the Chinese Government. He referred to the fact
                        that China had a great dearth of qualified, educated personnel in many
                        lines. He stated that continuance of the education of Chinese who were
                        studying here was a matter of importance to the Chinese Government.</p>
                    <p>He said that his approach related only to Chinese who were pursuing their
                        studies here.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Liu expressed the hope that this matter might receive prompt
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>I told Dr. Liu that I had no previous information in regard to the reported
                        arrangement with the Mexican Government, that we would be glad to look into
                        the question which he had raised, and that we would later get in touch with
                        him in regard to the matter.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Excellency</hi>: I have the honor to refer to various
                        discussions held between officers of the Department and of the Chinese
                        Embassy on the subject of the obligations of Chinese nationals in the United
                        States under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940,<note n="3" xml:id="d728fn3">Approved September 16, 1940; 54 Stat. 885.</note> as
                        amended. It is understood that the Embassy is in doubt as to the
                        applicability of that law to Chinese nationals and particularly to Chinese
                        students. The following outline of the principal provisions of the selective
                        service law is, therefore, furnished in order that the Embassy may be able
                        properly to advise Chinese nationals in the United States.</p>
                    <p>The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, a copy of which
                        is enclosed for convenient reference, provides generally that all male
                        American citizens and all male aliens residing in the United States who are
                        between the ages of 18 and 65 shall register, and that all such persons
                        between the ages of 18 and 45 shall be subject to military service. It
                        should be noted, however, that the induction of men who are 38 years of age
                        and over has been temporarily suspended.</p>
                    <pb n="815" xml:id="pg_815" facs="0825"/>
                    <p>In regard to the status of aliens in the United States, it should be noted
                        that all such aliens who are residing in the United States and who are
                        within the specified age limits are required to register and are liable for
                        service unless they are within one of the classes specified in Section 5 of
                        the Act. Certain aliens who were lawfully admitted into the United States
                        may, under a procedure established by the Selective Service Regulations,
                        have a determination made whether they are or are not “residing in the
                        United States” within the meaning of the selective service law. Any alien
                        who comes to the United States and remains longer than three months must
                        either register or obtain from the appropriate local board of the Selective
                        Service System a Certificate of Non-residence. The regulations require that
                        the application for such certificate be filed by the alien within three
                        months after the date of his entry into the United States, or within three
                        months after persons of his age become liable for training and service by
                        law, or prior to May 16, 1942, whichever is the later. Certificates of
                        non-residence are generally issued for a limited length of time not
                        exceeding six months, but an application for a new certificate may be made
                        before the date of expiration of the old one.</p>
                    <p>With regard to Chinese students, it may be stated that certain arrangements
                        have been made between the Selective Service System, the Department of State
                        and the China Institute in America whereby the latter certifies to the bona
                        fide student status and to the importance to the Government of China of the
                        studies being undertaken by individual Chinese nationals; these assurances
                        are given due weight by the Selective Service System in determining whether
                        the individual in question is entitled to recognition as a person not
                        “residing in the United States”. It has been determined that those Chinese
                        nationals who are receiving practical training in the United States cannot
                        properly be regarded as non-residents; however, the assurances of the China
                        Institute in America receive due consideration in determining whether
                        occupational deferment may be granted. It may be added that there has been
                        no difficulty in regard to Chinese students and Chinese nationals receiving
                        advanced training, on whose behalf the China Institute in America gives the
                        assurances referred to above, and there is no reason to believe that this
                        situation will change, provided that the same strict tests continue to be
                        applied by the China Institute before giving the assurances.</p>
                    <p>While this arrangement with the China Institute in America probably will be
                        applicable only to a limited number of Chinese students and to certain other
                        Chinese nationals, it should be understood that it is the privilege of any
                        other Chinese national to avail himself of <pb n="816" xml:id="pg_816" facs="0826"/>the opportunity provided under the Selective Service
                        Regulations to have a determination of his residence made.</p>
                    <p>The Department will be glad, in individual cases, to request the Selective
                        Service System to review the file of any registrant who has experienced
                        difficulties with his local board. In all such cases, however, full
                        information should be furnished to the Department as to the number and
                        address of the local board concerned, together with such data concerning the
                        registrant as may be pertinent, including the date of his arrival in the
                        United States, his status under the immigration laws, his occupation, age,
                        and, if he failed to apply for a determination of his residence within the
                        period of time prescribed by the Selective Service Regulations, the reason
                        for such delay. This information should be furnished to the Department in a
                        memorandum or note.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed from the foregoing that, with the exception of those
                        groups of persons who are specifically exempt from registration and service
                        under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, as amended, and of
                        those aliens who are found upon application not to be “residing in the
                        United States”, all other male Chinese nationals between the ages of 18 and
                        65 are required to register and that those between the ages of 18 and 45 are
                        subject to military service if called by their local boards.</p>
                    <p>It is understood that a directive has recently been issued by the Selective
                        Service System to local boards to the effect that consideration be given in
                        the classification of Chinese registrants to contributions that may have
                        regularly been made by the registrants to dependents residing in China.
                        Under this directive the boards have been authorized to place in Class III–A
                        or Class III–B Chinese registrants who prove to the satisfaction of the
                        board that they have been contributing regularly substantial sums to
                        dependents residing in China. It is believed that the Selective Service
                        System is aware of the special circumstances relating to Chinese nationals,
                        since this directive represents a departure from the regular procedure
                        applying uniformly to all aliens other than Chinese. The Department
                        understands, however, that this directive is subject to cancellation at any
                        time. Therefore, it would appear desirable that both the Embassy and the
                        Chinese Consular offices in the United States cooperate in calling to the
                        attention of Chinese nationals that it will be necessary for them to comply
                        with orders issued by their draft boards.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing information is being brought to your attention as of assistance
                        in bringing about satisfactory adjustments with reference to various of the
                        questions which officials of the Embassy have brought informally to the
                        attention of officers of the Department, including questions relating to
                        Chinese students in this country. It is <pb n="817" xml:id="pg_817" facs="0827"/>the hope of the Department that in the light of this
                        information it may also be possible for the Embassy to take such action as
                        you may deem appropriate toward achieving a reduction in the number of
                        Chinese registrants now being listed by the Selective Service boards as
                        delinquents. I may assure you that the Department will be pleased to
                        cooperate with you in this matter, and that it will be pleased to arrange
                        for a discussion of the problem between officers of the Embassy, of the
                        Department and of the Selective Service System if you believe that such a
                        discussion would be fruitful in achieving the desired results.</p>

                        plans to send a daily ten minute broadcast in Spanish from Chungking to the

                        enough to reach South America. It is suggested that the broadcast may be
                        relayed via San Francisco through the courtesy of the American short-wave

                    <p>The Ambassador will be greatly obliged if the Secretary will be good enough

                    <p>The Secretary of State presents his compliments to His Excellency the
                        Ambassador of China and has the honor to refer to his note of July 4, 1943
                        concerning plans of the Chinese Central Broadcasting Station to send a daily
                        ten minute broadcast in Spanish from Chungking to the countries of South
                        America. The note suggests that the proposed broadcast might be relayed via
                        the American shortwave station, KWID, in San Francisco in as much as the
                        Chinese station, XGOY, is not sufficiently powerful to reach South America
                        directly.</p>
                    <p>The Department desires to inform His Excellency that it is contrary to the
                        policy of this Government to make available the facilities of shortwave
                        radio stations controlled by this Government for the relaying of regular or
                        continuing series of broadcasts originating in a foreign country and
                        directed towards other foreign countries. It is regretted, therefore, that
                        it is not possible to make arrangements for the relay of daily programs from
                        Chungking to the other American republics as suggested in the Ambassador’s
                        note.</p>

                    <p>There are attached hereto, for the information of the Ambassador,<note n="1" xml:id="d731fn1">Clarence E. Gauss.</note> a copy of a “Tentative Draft
                        of a Joint Four-Power Declaration” which was handed to Dr. Soong<note n="2" xml:id="d731fn2">T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> on September 21 in the strictest confidence, together
                        with a copy of an “oral statement” in record of what was said to Dr. Soong
                        in connection with this document.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong expressed the opinion that communication of the tentative draft to
                        him would suffice for and should be considered as communication of the
                        matter to his Government. Dr. Soong said further that he was leaving
                        Washington for Chungking the following week and that he would undertake to
                        communicate with Chungking. Subsequently it was suggested to Dr. Soong that
                        for reasons of security he might wish to limit himself to taking the
                        documents under reference with him to Chungking without having communicated
                        them to his Government by telegraphic means. In response Dr. Soong said that
                        he would take the papers with him on his person. (He did not, however,
                        indicate whether he would or would not telegraph regarding them.)</p>
                    <p>It is not desired that the Embassy take any initiative in the matter. The
                        copies of the documents under reference are transmitted to the Ambassador
                        for his information in the event that the matter is taken up with him by
                        appropriate officials of the Chinese Government. In the event of such an
                        approach to the Ambassador, the Ambassador should communicate full
                        particulars and his comments to the Department, taking special precautions
                        as to the security of the method and substance of communication.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Secretary</hi>: I have found, in the course of
                        a number of conversations which I have had with British officials since
                        arriving here, a surprising unanimity of opinion that an exclusive
                        commitment for purposes of leadership on the part of the Anglo-Saxon Powers
                        would not be the most practical objective to pursue, together with a general
                        leaning toward the concept that in the formation of an “Executive Committee”
                        for United Nations purposes, an arrangement <pb n="822" xml:id="pg_822" facs="0832"/>among four Powers (that is including China) would be better
                        than either a two Powers or a three Powers arrangement. With regard
                        especially to China, there has appeared among those with whom I have talked
                        a general consensus of view that it would be easier to influence China with
                        regard to both the international aspects and the internal aspects of her
                        development if China be on the inside of whatever special grouping there may
                        be of the major nations than if China be on the outside. This is what I have
                        found most interesting in discussions with the comparatively small number of
                        contacts with whom I have had discussions thus far. The persons with whom I
                        have held these discussions are, however, persons in important positions.
                        You will realize that it is gratifying to me to have encountered these views
                        and that I am hoping to find that they are widely held.</p>
                    <p>I trust that your journey will be a safe one and your efforts be crowned with
                        great success.</p>

                    <p>1914. Department’s 1442, October 7. Generalissimo inquired as to Mr. Hull’s
                        health and asked whether he would personally attend Tripartite Foreign
                        Ministers Conference. I replied I had no official information but assumed
                        from recent press reports that he would attend in person. He then asked
                        where conference would be held. I stated that when I left Washington there
                        had been no announcement on the subject. He then asked what was the opinion
                        in Washington when I left as to Soviet continuance in the war and
                        collaboration with partners of the United Nations. I replied that I had not
                        discussed this subject with higher authorities in Washington but that from
                        my conversation in official circles generally I had definite impression that
                        there is full American confidence that Soviet Russia will continue in the
                        war and in collaboration with partners of United Nations. Generalissimo
                        commented that there has always been deep suspicion of Soviet intentions and
                        subject is one of great importance. I replied that I had, of course, noted
                        press speculation regarding intentions of Soviet Russia; that while there
                        had been mutual suspicion between Soviet Russia and other powers for many
                        years and it might take some time fully to break down any such suspicion
                        still lingering in <pb n="823" xml:id="pg_823" facs="0833"/>the minds of
                        unofficial observers, there seemed in official circles at home to be every
                        indication of confidence that relations with the Soviet would continue on a
                        satisfactory basis and that the meeting of the Foreign Ministers would be
                        successful in clarifying objectives and policies in matters of mutual
                        concern and interest with reference to the European theater of the war.</p>

                    <p>1962. Foreign Minister Soong this morning asked me to inform Secretary Hull
                        at Moscow that China is completely in agreement with American draft of
                        proposed joint declaration by four powers, that China requests to be
                        consulted by us in case any modification of American draft is considered by
                        Three Power Conference and that China hopes to be informed by us from time
                        to time of the negotiations at Three Power Conference when this subject
                        comes up for discussion. Soong admitted in conversation that he had received
                        the British proposed redraft of the declaration.</p>
                    <p>In order to preserve security our codes and assuming Department has rapid and
                        direct communication with Secretary Hull at Moscow, I am not repeating

                    <p>Mr. Molotov<note n="8" xml:id="d736fn8">V. M. Molotov, Soviet Commissar for
                            Foreign Affairs.</note> … added that the first question which occurred
                        to the Soviet Delegation which had arisen immediately after the receipt of
                        the original draft from the United States Government in September was
                        whether it would be possible to consider a draft Four-Nation Declaration
                        which included China in the absence of any representative of that
                        country.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary stated that as he had previously said the United States
                        Government was anxious to ascertain the attitude of the various <pb n="824" xml:id="pg_824" facs="0834"/>Governments associated with it in this war,
                        whether in whole or in part, toward the principles which were set forth in
                        this document. In regard to procedure the Secretary said that he was willing
                        to accept anything that was agreeable to the others in regard to the
                        mechanics of consideration of the draft and that in regard to China he felt
                        that the inclusion of China was of the greatest importance, in order to
                        preserve the spirit of the unity of the United Nations. He went on to say
                        that China could sign later and also other nations if they desired, as in
                        the case of the United Nations Declaration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov asked if there would be any objection to changes being made in
                        the draft proposal without the presence of the Chinese at the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that in his view this was a matter for the assembled
                        delegates to handle and that he believed that the document as agreed upon
                        here could be submitted to the Chinese Government before the close of the
                        Conference. He added that according to information which he had received
                        from the Chinese Ambassador the Chinese Government approved the Four-Nation
                        Declaration and merely desired to be informed of any changes which might be
                        introduced in the text at this Conference. He went on to say that if and
                        when the document is finished here the Chinese Government could be informed
                        immediately and asked to participate.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov said that from the point of view of the Soviet Government the
                        difficulty lay in the fact that no final decision could be made on the
                        document if China was to be a party in the absence of a Chinese
                        representative, whereas if the document was considered as a Three-Power
                        Declaration it would be possible to agree and sign it during the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary repeated that in his opinion it would seem logical to perfect
                        the document at the Conference as a four nation one, sign it, and pass it on
                        later to the Chinese Government for its approval or disapproval.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov said that in considering all of the advantages of which he was
                        fully aware of having the Four Nations sign the document, the one great
                        disadvantage from the Soviet point of view was that if China was to be
                        associated originally in the Declaration it could not be finally decided
                        upon at this Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said that in the view of the United States Government this
                        proposal was completely in line with the previous declarations of the United
                        Nations which were designed to bring into association all the nations
                        associated in whole or in part with one aspect or another of the war against
                        the Axis and that if we should now abandon the spirit and nature and letter
                        of the United Nations movement it would produce division of opinion and only
                        lead to confusion, <pb n="825" xml:id="pg_825" facs="0835"/>since on all
                        these broad questions every country associated with us in the war, whether
                        in whole or in part, were equally interested in the general principles
                        involved.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Eden<note n="9" xml:id="d736fn9">Anthony Eden, British Secretary of State
                            for Foreign Affairs.</note> said that it seemed to him that there were
                        two points to consider: (1) the particular problem of China, which might be
                        handled by perfecting and agreeing on the Declaration here and then
                        immediately submitting it to the Chinese Government, and if the Chinese
                        approved it might be possible to obtain the signatures of the four Nations
                        before the end of the Conference, and (2) whether or not Mr. Hull intended
                        that other nations would immediately adhere to this Declaration since he
                        personally had already envisaged it as an instrument of the Four
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary replied that he believed that many nations would make
                        application to join but that he was not advocating such policy.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Eden said that he had particularly in mind Section 6 with regard to the
                        technical military commission since he felt it would be undesirable at this
                        stage to associate any other nations in such a commission.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov said that he agreed with Mr. Eden’s views on this point. He then
                        proposed that the Conference consider this draft as one of three and not
                        four Powers, but if it should prove possible to obtain the consent of the
                        Chinese Government before the end of the Conference it could then be
                        transformed into a Four-Nation Declaration. He said that he advanced this
                        proposal in order to make the text proposed by the Secretary, the contents
                        of which were viewed so favorably by all present, independent of the consent
                        of any fourth nation not represented at the Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary pointed out the importance of considering the psychological
                        situation of all the nations participating in one form or another, together
                        with us, in the war, and that he felt that if one of the great nations which
                        was making an important contribution to the war should be excluded, the
                        psychological effect would be most harmful for the unity of the United
                        Nations.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov said that he thoroughly agreed with the Secretary on the
                        importance of the psychological aspect of the question, and, for that
                        reason, he therefore felt that a failure to obtain an agreement among the
                        three Powers on this draft would have a very adverse effect on the other
                        members of the United Nations, and that since the Conference was dealing
                        with the concrete problems presented by the Draft Declaration any undue
                        delay would in effect prejudice from the psychological point of view the
                        purpose that everyone had in mind. He suggested therefore that the
                        Conference proceed in the spirit of the United Nations to the consideration
                        of the concrete proposals.</p>
                    <pb n="826" xml:id="pg_826" facs="0836"/>
                    <p>The Secretary said that his observation had been in the nature of an
                        inquiry.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov replied that he had welcomed the Secretary’s observations, but he
                        would like to repeat that in his view this document should not be regarded
                        as necessarily a declaration of the four nations.</p>

                    <p>During an intermission for tea, after Mr. Molotov had raised objections to
                        the inclusion of China in the Four-Nation Interim Agreement, I said to him
                        privately that the American Government is doing everything and has done
                        everything possible with respect to the Chinese situation, that it would be
                        impossible in my judgment to omit China from the Four-Nation Agreement, that
                        it was the attitude of my government that China has been in the world
                        picture as one of the Big Four for the prosecution of the war and for her
                        now to be dumped out on her face by Russia, Great Britain and the United
                        States in connection with the proposed Four-Nation Agreement would create in
                        all probability the most terrific repercussions, both political and
                        military, in the Pacific area, and that this might call for all sorts of
                        readjustments by my Government for the purpose of keeping properly
                        stabilized the political and military situation in the Pacific. I added that
                        Great Britain would probably be likewise affected so far as giving attention
                        to the Pacific might be concerned. I said furthermore that public opinion in
                        my own country would be hopelessly torn and rent by the news that this
                        Government had joined with the Soviet Government in Moscow to throw China
                        out of the war picture, as the public would probably interpret her exclusion
                        from the Four-Nation Declaration proposal. These things were said in private
                        to Mr. Molotov and he appeared to recognize the reasonableness of what I
                        said.</p>
                    <p>We then turned to the question of developing closer relations between our two
                        countries and I emphasized the entire practicability of the matter, resting
                        this view on the broad condition that there are absolutely no material
                        interests or international interests that are not common to both countries,
                        and that each supplements the other with respect to trade and general
                        economic relations, etc. I added, before leaving, that I would be glad to
                        sit down and talk with him about some of the important points involved in
                        the undertaking to bring about closer relations and closer understanding. He
                        said he would be glad to take these matters up with me at any time.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Eden said that he would fully support the Secretary’s strong position on
                        the inclusion of China in the Four-Power Declaration. The British Ambassador
                        expressed his personal strong sympathy for this position and its importance
                        at this time. He suggested that some slight concession to the Soviets might
                        be necessary if it could be done without in any way compromising the Four
                        Power aspect of the Declaration. He suggested that the announcement might be
                        made as a declaration from the tri-partite conference with the combined
                        offer of the three participants to China to join in order to make it a
                        four-power declaration. He expressed the view that there would be no
                        difficulty in getting the Chinese Government’s immediate acceptance. This
                        small concession might well overcome Molotov’s reluctance to have a
                        four-power declaration emerge from a tri-partite conference. The Secretary
                        did not agree as to concession.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Molotov then announced that the Soviet Government had no objection to the
                        inclusion of China as an original signatory, but since he was most anxious
                        to have some declaration signed and announced before the Conference broke up
                        he was doubtful whether from a technical point of view it would be possible
                        for the Chinese Ambassador<note n="12" xml:id="d740fn12">Foo
                            Ping-sheung.</note> here to receive the necessary powers before the end
                        of the Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary said he would undertake to communicate the text to the Chinese
                        Government and he was convinced that the necessary powers would be
                        forthcoming to the Ambassador here for China to sign before the end of the
                        Conference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov accepted the Secretary’s suggestion but expressed the strong hope
                        that there would be no delay which would interfere with the publication by
                        the Conference of the contents of the Declaration.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary then said that he had thought of an alternative method of
                        ensuring China’s participation as an original signatory but he was merely
                        putting it out as a possibility as he was optimistic that the Chinese
                        Ambassador here would receive the necessary powers in time. This alternative
                        method was to permit China to sign as an original member within ten days
                        following the close of the Conference.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Molotov then said he considered that the Conference was in complete
                        agreement and authorized the Secretary to submit the text to the Chinese
                        Government on behalf of the Conference.</p>

                    <p>1749. DelAm 31. For the President and Acting Secretary from the Secretary of
                        State. Reference DelAm No. 26<note n="13" xml:id="d741fn13">Not

                            October 26, 5 a.m, from the Ambassador in the Soviet Union, <ref target="#pg_827">p. 827</ref>.</note> At the session this afternoon
                        after considerable discussion of the text the Conference adopted an approved
                        text of the Four Nation Declaration with minor changes which I will give
                        below. Molotov agreed on behalf of the Soviet Government to the
                        participation of China as an original signatory. He voiced doubt, however,
                        as to whether the Chinese Government would be able to send the necessary
                        powers to the Chinese Ambassador here to sign declaration before Conference
                        closed. I regard it as of the very highest importance that every effort be
                        made to ensure that Chiang Kai-shek send these powers to the Chinese
                        Ambassador in Moscow instantly. I saw the Chinese Ambassador immediately
                        after close of today’s session and impressed on him with great earnestness
                        the extreme urgency of the matter in the interests of all of us and
                        particularly in interests of China that he should be empowered to sign
                        before the end of the Conference which I told him might well be before the
                        end of this week. He is telegraphing immediately direct to Chungking for
                        immediate authorization to sign the declaration.</p>
                    <p>The following are the unimportant modifications made at today’s session when
                        the declaration was adopted in the text as communicated to you in DelAm No.
                        25 [<hi rend="italic">26</hi>]. The preamble remains the same except for the
                        addition of the words “of America” after “the United States”. Articles 1, 2,
                        3, 4, 5 and 7 remain unchanged. In article 6 the words “after the
                        termination of hostilities” were substituted for “following the defeat of
                        the enemy.” Article 8 was dropped at my suggestion following Molotov’s
                        apparent doubt as to exact meaning of the wording.</p>
                    <p>Please communicate instantly to Chungking for transmission to Chiang Kai-shek
                        the additional unimportant changes which were introduced in the text before
                        the declaration was finally adopted, and please instruct the Ambassador to
                        urge upon the Generalissimo the vital importance of the immediate despatch
                        of full powers by cable to his Ambassador here to sign this declaration.

                    <p>The Chinese Ambassador called at his request. He said that he merely called
                        to thank me again for what my Government had done for China during the
                        Conference. He then inquired whether I had anything else in mind about the
                        occurrences in the Conference that would be of interest to his
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>I replied that I had nothing especial, but that I might say that throughout
                        the Conference all Russian officials were exceedingly cordial and friendly
                        and when matters of difference were under discussion they talked them out
                        with us in a thoroughly agreeable spirit. I added that this was a splendid
                        state of mind with which to launch the great forward movement of
                        international cooperation with Russia for the first time a full-fledged
                        member of it without special reservation of any kind, that all of the signs
                        indicate that Mr. Stalin<note n="15" xml:id="d748fn15">Iosif Vissarionovich
                            Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Commissars (Premier) of the Soviet
                            Union.</note> and his Government are opposed to isolation and are
                        wholeheartedly in favor of the movement of international cooperation
                        launched by this Conference with Russia as a full partner with the United
                        States, Great Britain and China.</p>
                    <p>I then made clear to the Ambassador that neither I nor my associates had
                        intimated anything to the press about China’s difficulties in being
                        permitted to become one of the original signatories to the Four-Nation
                        Declaration except that last evening in answer to a question as to who sent
                        for the Ambassador to come and sign, I replied that the Conference sent for
                        him and there was no opposition to China as such in the Conference.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador said that he was pleased to have no publicity about China’s
                        difficulty and had cautioned his Government to say nothing whatever about
                        it, although he had given the Generalissimo the facts as to just what had
                        occurred for his confidential and personal information.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador then said in great confidence that he had been authorized by
                        the Generalissimo when he came to Moscow to say to Mr. Stalin that if and
                        when Russia should decide to enter the war against Japan, China would be
                        ready to make any kind of alliance with the Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>The Ambassador had first inquired whether the Russians had said anything
                        about Japan. I replied that I had nothing in mind that could be taken up
                        with him in that connection; that of course it is my rule to give him the
                        fullest possible information at all times in regard to matters of interest
                        to either of our Governments.</p>

                    <p>I and the people and army of our entire nation feel deeply gratified on
                        learning of the signature of the Joint Four-Nation Declaration. This act of
                        historic importance makes manifest to the world the righteousness of the
                        cause against aggression. It will not only strengthen the cooperation of our
                        Four Nations for the fulfilment of our common faith, but will also give all
                        peace-loving peoples of the world an assurance of the establishment of
                        international peace and general security, and thereby constitutes an
                        unsurpassed contribution to the future of the world. China is proud to have
                        taken part in the consummation of the Declaration, and I wish to offer you,
                        Mr. President, my heartiest congratulations. This Declaration owes much in
                        its making to your wise directions and the endeavors of Secretary of State
                        Cordell Hull at the Conference, which command our deepest admiration. Please
                        accept my sincere and grateful appreciation.</p>

                    <p>1635. Please convey the following message from the President to President
                        Chiang Kai-shek: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“I have received with deepest pleasure the cordial message from Your
                                Excellency upon the occasion of the signature of the Joint
                                Four-Nation Declaration, and I reciprocate your feeling of
                                satisfaction at its consummation. I welcome the association of China
                                in the work of establishing a better world order. The Declaration
                                gives assurance that the close coalition for war will be blended
                                into an effective and lasting coalition for peace. Upon our two
                                countries and the other nations associated with us in this
                                undertaking will rest the responsibility for the preservation and
                                extension of the principles of freedom, justice, and integrity among
                                nations, for which we are now fighting. The participation of China
                                in this historic Declaration has afforded Secretary Hull and me deep
                                gratification, as it has the American people. The immediate task
                                before us is that of vanquishing the aggressors. Along with this and
                                beyond are the tasks of reconstruction looking toward creating
                                conditions of lasting peace. Formidable <pb n="835" xml:id="pg_835" facs="0845"/>though all these tasks are, we march forward to

                    <p>1251. It is evident that some uneasiness exists in the minds of the refugee
                        governments and authorities and their respective countries over the question
                        of the possible establishment of military government in those countries. As
                        there is every intention of having those governments and constituted
                        authorities participate to the extent practicable in the function of
                        maintaining law and order and in the administration of the liberated areas
                        it has seemed desirable to make a public statement to that effect. This
                        Government proposes therefore to issue an identic statement on liberated
                        areas with the British Government on September 15. You are instructed
                        therefore to communicate this statement to the Chinese authorities for any
                        comment they may care to make with regard thereto. You should request that
                        the matter be considered strictly confidential until the date of
                        release.</p>
                    <p>The statement reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                            <p>“1. The Governments of the United States and United Kingdom,
                                    necessarily by reason of their military operations in enemy
                                    territory, must assume the major responsibility for the
                                    administration of enemy territories conquered by their forces in
                                    pursuance of the war against the Axis.</p>

                                        authority in liberated areas pending the defeat of the
                                        enemy, will be agreeable to the policy of the governments
                                        and constituted authorities of the United Nations in their
                                        respective liberated countries proceeding with the function
                                        of maintaining law and order with such assistance by the
                                        Allied authorities as may be necessary, subject always to

                                        countries have already been in progress for some time on

                    <p>1688. Department’s 1251, September 7. I communicated the proposed statement
                        to the Acting Foreign Minister<note n="1" xml:id="d753fn1">K. C. Wu, Chinese
                            Political Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs.</note> September 10. On
                        September 11, Director of American Affairs Department informed me that
                        Chinese Government concurred in the proposed statement but with the
                        qualification that it not be considered a precedent for publication [<hi rend="italic">application?</hi>] to areas in Far East. From his ensuing
                        remarks in which he raised a number of academic questions it was apparent
                        that he had chiefly in mind occupied areas in China.</p>
                    <p>I said in reply that the statement had been formulated in explanatory
                        remarks, to meet a specific situation; that it obviously concerned areas in
                        Europe in which American and British forces were conducting operations; and
                        that I felt sure that no question or thought in regard to occupied areas of
                        China had arisen in the mind of anyone. I pointed out that when Japanese
                        forces should be driven out of occupied China the question of temporary
                        military administration would assumably rest with Chinese and other
                        commanders pending setting up by the Chinese Government of civil
                        administration. I mentioned that Chiang Kai-shek was the Allied
                        Commander-in-Chief in this theatre.</p>
                    <p>The Director seemed satisfied and there would not appear to be any present
                        need of pursuing the matter further with him.</p>

                    <p>1730. Embassy’s 1688, September 12. We have now received an informal note
                        from Acting Foreign Minister dated September 15 in which Dr. Wu states that
                        the issuance of statement in question is both timely and proper in the
                        opinion of Chinese Government. He adds that, however “in view of prospective
                        developments in military situation in Far East”, it is feeling of Chinese
                        Government that there is a similar need of common understanding in regard to
                        question of administration of liberated areas in this region. He expresses
                        the hope of Chinese Government that such common understanding may be reached
                        at an early date by Governments of the United States, Great Britain and
                        China and he asks that his comments and this hope be brought to the
                        attention of the American Government.</p>

                    <p>1781. Embassy’s 1730, September 16. Administration of liberated areas. In
                        conversation with the Acting Foreign Minister September 21, Dr. Wu brought
                        up this question and said that after further consideration the Chinese felt
                        no concern in regard to possibility of misunderstanding among Chinese and
                        American military commanders in areas of China liberated from Japanese
                        occupation but were feeling a growing concern in regard to adjacent areas
                        such as Burma and Thailand. He said that as neither China nor the United
                        States had any territorial ambitions and had made this clear there were
                        doubts as to the intentions “of others” and a concrete problem would be
                        presented if, for example, Chinese troops should invade Burma from China and
                        British troops should invade Burma from India. The Chinese Government
                        accordingly considered that it would be most advisable to have all possible
                        questions resolved beforehand in order to avoid unfortunate complications
                        and some suggestions in this respect had been telegraphed to Dr. Soong<note n="3" xml:id="d756fn3">T. V. Soong, Chinese Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> in Washington for discussion with the Department.</p>

                        the Chinese Government (your 1730, September 16) in regard to liberated
                        areas is meant to extend to the Far Eastern region generally or whether
                        (with reference to your 1688, September 12) Chinese interest relates
                        primarily to occupied areas of China.</p>

                    <p>2123. Your 1519, October 26. Stilwell tells us that in the conversations
                        between Generalissimo and Mountbatten the question of civil administration
                        of liberated areas was not specifically discussed but that Mountbatten
                        desired to attach to the various allied units including Chinese units
                        British civil officers of the former Burma Government now commissioned as
                        officers in the British Army to serve as liaison officers but actually to be
                        intelligence officers and to reestablish the civil government of Burma as
                        soon as possible. While there was agreement to acceptance of liaison
                        officers, no understanding was reached as to the activities of such officers
                        and Stilwell says Mountbatten is not satisfied on this point. I also
                        understand that the activities of these liaison officers with the Chinese
                        units is being limited.</p>
                    <p>There was also discussion between Generalissimo and Mountbatten on the
                        overlapping of their respective theatres of command as regards Thailand;
                        this was arranged by agreement that either theatre commander might proceed
                        into Thailand and the boundary of military jurisdiction as between them
                        would be the line where their two forces might meet. No question apparently
                        was raised regarding French Indochina.</p>

                    <p>11. Ministry of Finance official has told us that Chinese Ambassador,<note n="2" xml:id="d762fn2">Wei Tao-ming.</note> Washington, has transmitted
                        invitation from American to Chinese Government to send an expert to
                        Washington to discuss Chinese fiscal problems. Minister for Foreign
                            Affairs<note n="3" xml:id="d762fn3">T. V. Soong.</note> has commented to
                        us that he hopes to take back to Washington with him (he expects to depart
                        in about a month) a number of Chinese experts to discuss and plan for
                        postwar reconstruction in China with American aid. Other Chinese officials,
                        competent to discuss the matter, have from time to time officially indicated
                        a desire to have an American, with broad experience in matters of economic
                        development, visit China in the near future to discuss with competent
                        Chinese officials various reconstruction problems related to agriculture,
                        industry, commerce and finances. They feel that a competent American could,
                        through conversations and investigations here, obtain a coordinated picture
                        of China’s postwar needs which would be useful in Washington.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese are anticipating financial aid from us for postwar development.
                        The various interested ministries and other organizations of the Government
                        have plans for reconstruction but it appears that little has been done to
                        coordinate these plans and it is not improbable that some of them will have
                        little practical direct bearing on what will be China’s pressing postwar
                        needs. For instance, it would appear that measures to maintain China’s
                        credit by support of currency and restoration of foreign trade on a sound
                        basis (and to improve the livelihood of China’s predominantly agricultural
                        population) by agrarian reform and promotion of village industries should
                        receive priority consideration by the Chinese rather than for large scale
                        industrial and communications enterprises and special projects promoted by
                        Government and private interests. If the National Government’s credit can
                            <pb n="842" xml:id="pg_842" facs="0852"/>be maintained and the
                        purchasing power of the mass of the population can be improved, well
                        coordinated industrial and communications projects should follow without
                        much artificial stimulation. The Embassy feels that an American expert, not
                        adviser, on economic organization might prove useful in prompting the
                        synthesis of plans which is required for the purpose of intelligently and
                        authoritatively advising the American Government on the situation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        Department’s information a translation of a special article<note n="4" xml:id="d764fn4">Not printed.</note> by Mr. Shao Yu-lin, Director of the
                        Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, entitled “How to
                        Liquidate Japan”, published in the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> and
                        Central News Agency despatches. Mr. Shao, a returned student from Japan, is
                        a member of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s Household Secretariat or
                        Adjutant’s Office and is considered to be strongly nationalistic in his
                        views. The views expressed are believed to be generally representative of
                        Chinese official and private opinion with respect to Japan and to China’s
                        war effort.</p>
                    <pb n="843" xml:id="pg_843" facs="0853"/>
                    <p>The article expresses the writer’s opinion that nothing less than the total
                        destruction of the Japanese army will be sufficient to win the war. It
                        refers to the Japanese naval losses suffered at the hands of the American
                        navy, the limitations of Japanese shipbuilding capacities and Japanese
                        aerial weaknesses both in quantity and quality, but warns that even a
                        crushing naval and aerial attack against the Japanese islands would not
                        decide the final outcome of the war. In explanation of this statement, Mr.
                        Shao points out that in anticipation of Allied air attacks Japan has moved
                        important industrial plants from Japan proper to Manchuria and North China
                        and has an army of more than one million troops ready to defend Manchuria,
                        North China and the coastal regions. Therefore, to ensure the defeat of
                        Japan Allied naval and air forces must be assisted by a large and strong
                        Chinese army and that army must be supplied with planes, tanks and heavy
                        artillery. These supplies must not await the reopening of the Burma Road but
                        must be sent immediately—at all costs and at all risks. Mr. Shao goes on to
                        say that the total annihilation of the Japanese army is an essential
                        condition to winning the peace as well as the war. He reviews the political
                        history of Japan, pointing out the ascendancy of the militarist elements in
                        the Japanese Government and stating that without their elimination genuine
                        peace in the Far East would be impossible.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Shao concludes with a statement of Chinese postwar aims which include the
                        restoration of Formosa, the Ryu Kyu Islands and the Four Northeastern
                        Provinces. With respect to Korea he states that the restoration of Korean
                        independence is a foregone conclusion, a logical consequence of the present
                        Sino-Japanese War and one of the war aims of the United Nations.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese Foreign Minister, Dr. T. V. Soong, called to see me today at his
                        request.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong said that he had had a conversation with Mr. Eden<note n="12" xml:id="d767fn12">Anthony Eden, British Secretary of State for Foreign
                            Affairs.</note> at the British Embassy, which had not covered more than
                        a very limited field, and he would be most grateful if I could give him any
                        general impressions with regard to Mr. Eden’s conversations in Washington
                        which I thought would be helpful to his Government.</p>
                    <p>I said that I was glad to inform Dr. Soong that the position of this
                        Government, as stated by the President, was that China was an indispensable
                        part of the machinery required in the major war effort, and that, in the
                        judgment of this Government, China must equally be an indispensable part of
                        the world organization to be set up in the future. I said I believed that
                        the views of the British Government and ours were very much in accord on
                        this basic premise.</p>
                    <p>I said, furthermore, that, with regard to the steps to be taken in the Far
                        East and in the Pacific after the war was won, I again felt that the views
                        of the Chinese, the British and the United States Governments were very much
                        in accord. I said we were all in agreement that Korea must be set up as an
                        independent country under a temporary international trusteeship, that the
                        Japanese people must be restricted to their own main islands, that Formosa
                        must be returned to China, and that the former mandated islands in the
                        Pacific should be placed under some form of international trusteeship for
                        the purpose of insuring international security.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong inquired what the views of the British Government might be with
                        regard to Hong Kong after the war. I said I felt that this was a matter
                        which could only be discussed between the Chinese and British Governments
                        and that I was not in a position to express any opinion with regard
                        thereto.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong then inquired what the views of the British and United States
                        Governments might be with regard to the future status of Manchuria. I
                        replied that both Governments believed that Chinese sovereignty should once
                        more be reestablished over Manchuria, although with the understanding that
                        the legitimate commercial interests of the Soviet Union would be given full
                        recognition by the Chinese Government of the future. Dr. Soong inquired what
                        my opinion might be with regard to the nature of these legitimate commercial
                        interests. I said that here again I was not in a position to <pb n="846" xml:id="pg_846" facs="0856"/>reply since that would obviously seem, at
                        least in the first instance, to be a matter to be discussed between the
                        Soviet and Chinese interests and that this Government had no indication from
                        the Soviet Government with regard to its views in this matter. I added that
                        I had no information that the British Government had any views on this
                        subject either.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong did not mention the subject of India, nor did he mention the status
                        of the present European colonies in the southwest Pacific.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Soong stated with much emphasis and with much satisfaction that both his
                        Government and he were greatly encouraged by the steps recently taken by the
                        Government of the United States to speed up the furnishing of military
                        supplies to China. He said that the recent sending of air transports to
                        China had been most gratifying and that the appointment of General
                            Chennault<note n="13" xml:id="d767fn13">Appointment of Maj. Gen. Claire

                        Government. He also stated that he had just received a telegram from General

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose for the
                        information of the Department a copy of a memorandum of conversation which I
                        had several days ago with Dr. Wang Shih-chieh, Secretary General of the
                        State Planning Board (Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is Director) and
                        Secretary General of the People’s Political Council. Although Dr. Wang,
                        under fire from the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang at its
                        last meeting in November (the only criticism which the Embassy heard was
                        that he was accused of being pro-British), has resigned as Minister of
                        Information, he still holds a position of influence and is understood to
                        meet with the Generalissimo at frequent intervals for discussion of China’s
                        problems. It is believed that the Department will find interesting his
                        comments and point of view on Chinese and world situations and problems. The
                        interest which he evinced in certain matters is worthy of note. He himself
                        raised such questions as the coordination of American Government activities
                        in Chungking, the British and American monetary stabilization <pb n="847" xml:id="pg_847" facs="0857"/>plans, American participation in a regional

                        <p>Yesterday I had tea with Dr. Wang Shih-Chieh, at his invitation, and a
                            two-hour discussion regarding various subjects introduced by Dr. Wang.
                            Dr. Kuo Pin-chia, close friend of Dr. Wang, was present throughout most
                            of the conversation.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wang said that he would like to have clarified in his mind the
                            relation between the Embassy and the various other official American
                            organizations represented in Chungking. He mentioned specifically the
                            American Information Service, the Board of Economic Warfare, and the
                            American Army. I told him that the AIS represented the Office of War
                            Information in Washington which was an organization separate from the
                            State Department but that the director of AIS (Mr. Fisher, and in his
                            absence Mr. Stewart) operated under the general supervision of the
                            Embassy and in close cooperation therewith. The same situation, I said,
                            obtained with regard to representatives in China of the Board of
                            Economic Warfare. I described in general terms the personnel, setup, and
                            work of each. With regard to the Army, I told Dr. Wang that General
                            Stilwell’s Command in this area was completely independent of the
                            Embassy but that there were, as occasion therefor arose, exchanges of
                            view between the one and the other on matters of mutual interest or in
                            regard to matters in which the one or the other desired specific
                            information or assistance. In reply to his inquiry I told him that there
                            was no provision for regular conferences between the Army Command and
                            the Embassy. Dr. Wang did not indicate the reason for his inquiry (I
                            think it was simply curiosity) and I did not pursue the subject.</p>
                        <p>Knowing that Dr. Chien Tuan-sheng was a friend of Dr. Wang, I mentioned
                            two articles which I had read recently by Dr. Chien on China’s post-war
                            peace problems (Embassy’s despatch no. 1062 of April 7, 1943 and
                            despatch no. 1078, April 14, 1943<note n="15a" xml:id="d768fn16">Neither
                                printed.</note>). Dr. Wang said that he was familiar with Dr.
                            Chien’s ideas on the subject but had not read the articles. I mentioned
                            Dr. Chien’s discussion of “welfare economy” for China as distinguished
                            from “defense economy”. I <pb n="848" xml:id="pg_848" facs="0858"/>referred to comments made to me recently by Dr. Tseng Yang-fu,
                            Minister of Communications, who had said that it was impossible in China
                            to make such a distinction with regard to the future economic problems
                            of China and that anyone who attempted to do so was talking hypothetical
                            nonsense; that post-war development of industry and mining, of
                            communications, and of trade, would be for the welfare and defense of
                            the Chinese people. I had pointed out to Dr. Tseng that this might be
                            true with a very large proportion of post-war economic development but
                            that there would be an important minor proportion where a cleavage
                            between the two objectives might exist. The question would arise, for
                            instance, in connection with the steel industry which he had proposed
                            developing; that is, whether the steel was to be used in machinery to
                            produce consumers goods or for armament. It might also arise in
                            connection with a choice of routes over which to build his proposed
                            railways. Dr. Wang commented that the distinction made by Dr. Chien
                            between the objectives of postwar economic development was certainly one
                            which was very much in the minds of Chinese leaders at this time. He did
                            not feel that Dr. Chien’s discussion was irrelevant to China’s post-war
                            economic problems but he did not give any indication of his own views.
                            (I surmise that he inclines toward Dr. Chien’s viewpoint.) The
                            discussion was concluded with my remark that China might find that
                            economic development which contributed effectively toward raising the
                            standard of living of the Chinese people might in the long run prove a
                            better defense for China than a modern military organization on an
                            extensive scale which the Chinese people could ill afford.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wang asked me about the post-war monetary plans and ideas that had
                            recently been given prominence in the press. He had heard that America
                            was making a strong bid for Russian adherence to the American monetary
                            stabilization plan. He subsequently expanded this statement by saying
                            that Britain was also making a bid for Russian support of the British
                            plan. I told Dr. Wang that I had no official information on the subject.
                            He said that he understood the British envisaged discussions only
                            between Great Britain and America in the initial stages, whereas the
                            Americans seemed to have left the matter open with a view to general
                            discussion among all interested nations. I told him that I knew nothing
                            of the British ideas for consideration of their scheme (I understand
                            that the British scheme has been submitted to the Chinese Government for
                            its consideration) but that I thought we were prepared to discuss our
                            scheme with interested nations; that these discussions would be more or
                            less along the line of an informal exchange of views; and that the
                            participants would probably be our own Treasury officials and the
                            financial experts of various interested countries some of whom were
                            already in the United States. <pb n="849" xml:id="pg_849" facs="0859"/>Dr. Wang said that he did not feel there was any fundamental
                            difference in the American and British objectives which would prevent an
                            agreement with regard to a stabilization plan. He expressed preference
                            for the British emphasis on trade rather than gold as the basis for a
                            stabilization fund, and he thought that the Russians might also find the
                            British scheme preferable. With regard to the Russians, he said that any
                            scheme which envisaged that the Russians might be willing to abandon or
                            modify their managed socialist economy, particularly with regard to
                            foreign trade, would be unrealistic. He suspected that the Americans
                            were inclined to be naively sanguine in this regard. He said that
                            probably many countries would have government-controlled foreign trade
                            after the war. Such would be the case with China, he felt sure. I told
                            him that from what I had heard and read I thought that our Treasury
                            officials and others had a fairly clear, as well as sympathetic,
                            understanding of the Russian post-war economic position. Dr. Wang said
                            that he had seen the British scheme and asked me whether I had a copy of
                            the American scheme. I told him I did not but would endeavor to get one
                            from Mr. Adler, our Treasury Department representative on the Chinese
                            Stabilization Board.</p>
                        <p>[Here follow four paragraphs of comment regarding post-war Europe.]</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wang next spoke of global strategy in the war and asked whether I
                            thought that, if an offensive in Western Europe failed to come off this
                            year or was inconclusive by next autumn, a revised strategy might not be
                            decided upon to take the place of the strategy which he assumed was
                            adopted at the Casablanca Conference. He had in mind obviously the
                            question whether or not greater attention might be given to the Pacific
                            theater of the war. I remarked that, as he clearly understood, I was not
                            competent to comment on military strategy and that I did not have any
                            “inside” information. He asked for my personal view. I said that my own
                            view was that an offensive in Western Europe would take place this year
                            and that it would be sufficiently conclusive to indicate clearly that
                            the end of the war was approaching in Europe if in fact it did not
                            actually bring about the defeat of Germany. I went on to say, however,
                            that there seemed to me to be some confusion in Chinese thinking
                            regarding the American, and the British, attitude toward the two
                            principal theaters of the war—Europe and the Pacific. America and
                            Britain were in complete agreement regarding prosecution of the war, but
                            the roles they had to play were not identical. Great Britain must of
                            necessity devote its principal if not its entire attention to the
                            European theater. Transference of any considerable British strength from
                            Europe to the Far East would be unsound. Therefore when Churchill spoke
                            of <pb n="850" xml:id="pg_850" facs="0860"/>giving prior attention to
                            the battle in Europe he was not simply expressing a preference but was
                            stating a necessity. With America the situation was not exactly the
                            same. We were aiding in Europe and would continue to do so in increasing
                            degree but this did not mean we were neglecting the Pacific area. To
                            commence a real offensive in the Pacific additional naval strength was a
                            necessity. Air strength was a vital adjunct to a navy but it could not
                            operate successfully without a navy in the type of warfare which must be
                            conducted in the Pacific. It was my thought therefore that from the
                            American point of view an offensive in the Pacific was not contingent,
                            as in the case of the British, upon victory in Europe but upon the
                            progress made in our construction program of naval and merchant vessels.
                            From what I had heard, progress of this program was very encouraging and
                            would, I thought, warrant greatly increased activity in the Pacific
                            area, if not an all-out offensive, before the end of this year. I again
                            pointed out that, while success in Europe obviously would be an aid to
                            our offensive in the Pacific theater, that offensive was not actually
                            being made contingent upon success in Europe. Referring back then to Dr.
                            Wang’s question, I said that, whereas developments might call for
                            alterations in tactics, American strategy with regard to the Pacific
                            area was already decided upon and would be pursued irrespective of the
                            question which he had raised regarding developments in the European
                            theater.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wang and Dr. Kuo expressed appreciation of this viewpoint. Dr. Kuo
                            made the startling statement, for a Chinese, that he believed the
                            American offensive would be carried out in so far as possible directly
                            against Japan and that offensives in Burma and China would be of
                            secondary importance.</p>
                        <p>The conversation closed. Dr. Wang said that we should have another
                            meeting very soon at which time we could discuss problems more directly
                            concerned with the situation in China and in relation to China.</p>

                    <p>621. For Secretary of the Treasury only from Adler. TF–114. Learn from a
                        reliable source that Dr. Kung<note n="16" xml:id="d769fn16">Chinese Minister
                            of Finance.</note> called a special meeting on April 28 of leading
                        banking and financial experts to discuss British and American international
                        monetary plans. The discussion which took place was intelligent and
                        realistic. Almost all participants <pb n="851" xml:id="pg_851" facs="0861"/>favored China’s joining in scheme for international monetary cooperation
                        even though it entailed surrender of power to unilaterally change value of
                        her currency. Repeated emphasis was called to the crucial importance of the
                        fixing of the quota and to the need for transitional internal rehabilitation
                        and readjustment measures before China could participate effectively. While
                        a number of people felt British plan more flexible in certain respects, one
                        believed it superior to American plan. Hsu Kan, Minister of Food, reflecting
                        the consensus of opinion stated that though after abolition of unequal
                        treaties China should [not?] expect encroachments on her sovereignty
                        nevertheless as long as international affairs are not conducted by idealists
                        China must realistically measure what she would gain against what she would
                        lose.</p>
                    <p>He strongly favored Chinese participation as beneficial effects would accrue
                        from monetary stabilization. He felt China had more to gain from supporting
                        the United States since with the development of Chinese trade China would
                        inevitably find Britain, but not the United States, a competitor.</p>
                    <p>The Minister of Finance summing up said China must participate and must work
                        closely with America. He requested those present to submit to him proposals
                        which China might make on the lines of the discussion. These proposals,
                        which he warned the meeting should not be made tonight, will be worked into
                        an integrated plan by the Ministry of Finance to be submitted to the
                        Generalissimo for his OK. [Adler.]</p>

                    <p>624, Generalissimo Chiang, addressing newly formed Industrial Reconstruction
                        Planning Conference on 27th, made a strong plea for close collaboration
                        between the Government and industrial circles. He asked why the Chinese with
                        vast territory and rich potentialities had not progressed industrially
                        whereas the Japanese have made such remarkable progress. Answering his
                        question he said that the backwardness of Chinese industry was due to its
                        failure to link up with politics. “We must realize that the developments of
                        industry largely depend upon the collaboration of the Government; in other
                        words industry and politics must go hand-in-hand.” He said that previously
                        there was not only no coordination between the industrialists and the
                        Government but none even among the industrialists themselves <pb n="852" xml:id="pg_852" facs="0862"/>and advised that the present Conference
                        offered an opportunity to overcome this great impediment to the development
                        of industry and to study and understand each other’s problems. He concluded
                        by emphasizing that all phases of industrial reconstruction should be
                        motivated by a desire for the realization of the principles of San Min Chu

                    <p>629. To Secretary of Treasury from Adler. Reference my TF–115.<note n="17" xml:id="d771fn17">Not printed; it submitted a summary of press comment
                            on schemes for international monetary stabilization.</note> It will be
                        noted that the articles summarized are somewhat vague which is partly due to
                        fact that Ministry of Information has issued instructions for newspapers not
                        to take any definite stand until further notice. Nevertheless, these
                        articles reflect the two dominant and conflicting trends in the Chinese
                        approach to postwar problems, both in the monetary sphere in particular, and
                        the economic in general; namely, a strong and assertive nationalism on the
                        one hand and recognition of the need for external assistance on the other.
                        The trend towards an assertive nationalism receives support from the very
                        highest quarters—I understand that in the draft of the new book the
                        Generalissimo is writing on economic policy he favors high protective
                        tariffs, strict exchange control, et cetera (the article summarized from the
                            <hi rend="italic">China Times</hi> was written by Chu Ping-nan, member
                        of the Generalissimo’s so-called brain trust). There is a sufficient body of
                        realistic opinion in the Government to make it likely, however, that China
                        will cooperate with friendly powers whenever specific questions involving
                        such cooperation arise of which a clear instance is afforded in the

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose two memoranda by
                        Mr. J. Bartlett Richards, Commercial Attaché, as well as a summary of the
                        conclusions reached at a recent forum of college professors and economists,
                        all on the subject of post-war reconstruction.<note n="20" xml:id="d773fn20">None printed.</note>
               </p>
                    <p>This is a subject that has been receiving a good deal of attention in China,
                        officially as well as academically. So far, however, official interest has
                        been confined within the limits of individual ministries and there has been
                        no attempt to formulate a comprehensive and unified project for
                        reconstruction that would embody the ideas of those in charge of
                        agriculture, industry, transportation, social affairs, education, finance
                        etc. it is perhaps natural that individual ministries should desire to
                        formulate their own ideas and reach internal agreement on them before trying
                        to fit them into a comprehensive project. In the case of the Reconstruction
                        Conference recently concluded, to which reference is made in the enclosed
                        memorandum dated May 7, it does not appear that the officials and economists
                        of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the closely-allied National
                        Resources Commission, who comprised the delegates to the conference, were
                        able to draw up anything very clear or definite in the way of a plan of
                        reconstruction.</p>
                    <p>The National General Mobilization Council is planning to call a comprehensive
                        conference for the first week in June on the more urgent question of
                        increasing wartime production. It is believed <pb n="854" xml:id="pg_854" facs="0864"/>that some attention may also be given to post-war
                        reconstruction projects. The Ministries of Economic Affairs and Agriculture
                        will share in the direction of the Production Conference, as it will be
                        called, and there will be representatives of the Ministries of War, Finance,
                        Communications, Social Affairs, Food, Education, the National Health
                        Administration, the Joint Board of the Four Government Banks, the National
                        Conservancy Commission, the Commission for the Control of Liquid Fuel, the
                        Chungking Municipal Government, the various provincial governments, and
                        industrial and mining organizations as well as experts invited by the
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The Supreme National Defense Council is planning to hold a conference toward
                        the end of May, to discuss a number of major political and administrative
                        questions. It is believed that post-war reconstruction will receive some
                        attention, as one of the principal units of the Council, the Central
                        Planning Board, is preparing a 5-year post-war national defense and economic
                        reconstruction plan and a 10-year plan for the development of the
                        Northwest.</p>

                        no. 602, May 10, 10 p.m., in regard to the Industrial Reconstruction
                        Planning Conference held in Chungking from April 26 to May 6, as well as the
                        Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society, there is enclosed
                        herewith a memorandum of conversation between Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Minister of
                        Economic Affairs and the Embassy’s Commercial Attaché.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy hopes to be able to forward additional information on this
                        subject in the near future and will also report as completely as possible on
                        other scheduled conferences, including a Production Conference to be held
                        early in June, under the auspices of the National Mobilization Board, and a
                        conference of the Supreme National Defense Council, to be held at the end of
                        May, in which the Central Planning Board is expected to play a prominent
                        part.</p>
                    <p>It is not believed that anything of particular importance came out of the
                        Sixteenth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society. According to a
                        member, it was not attended by any prominent officials and did not agree on
                        any recommendations as to economic reconstruction. <pb n="855" xml:id="pg_855" facs="0865"/>The Embassy is endeavoring to obtain

                    <p>It is believed that the enclosed memorandum and future reports on the subject
                        may be of interest to the Board of Economic Warfare and to the Bureau of

                        <p>Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Minister of Economic Affairs, was very reluctant to
                            discuss the recent Industrial Reconstruction Planning Conference and
                            suggested that it would be much better for Dr. T. V. Soong to give out
                            the information in Washington. He mentioned that even the delegates who
                            attended the conference have not been permitted to keep their minutes,
                            but was not entirely clear as to why such secrecy should be observed,
                            his only explanation being that the proposals discussed at the
                            conference have no official standing unless they are approved by the
                            Generalissimo and the Executive Yuan. He admitted that there were
                            proposals discussed and that there were approximately 140, but he made
                            light of them, saying that they were of no importance.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the five-year plan for post-war industrial reconstruction,
                            Dr. Wong said that the conference did not go into much detail but merely
                            discussed estimates of the cost of such a plan. It was agreed that an
                            industrialization project such as China could afford would not be very
                            imposing from the western point of view and would not even bring China
                            up to a par with India industrially, but that it is better to be
                            realistic and not to undertake anything too ambitious. In the case of
                            steel, it was agreed that China might try for a production of about
                            2,000,000 tons a year, of which Japanese equipment already in China, if
                            not destroyed, would account for nearly half. Part of the steel industry
                            would be located in the Yangtze Valley, where there is a big market but
                            only limited ore reserves, but most of it would have to be in Manchuria,
                            where there are fairly good ore reserves but which is remote from the
                            principal markets. Other industrial projects would be devoted to the
                            manufacture of machinery, farm implements, heavy chemicals, etc. Dr.
                            Wong does not favor a large armaments industry, unless Japan should be
                            permitted to retain important heavy industries with the potentiality of
                            resuming arms production.</p>
                        <pb n="856" xml:id="pg_856" facs="0866"/>
                        <p>Dr. Wong said that he has not publicly made any suggestion that part of
                            the industrial equipment in Japan be turned over to China, but that he
                            did discuss it once at a dinner party and feels that it is a good
                            suggestion, not only because China is entitled to reparation from Japan
                            but also because Japan will continue a source of uneasiness in the Far
                            East so long as she is permitted to retain on a large scale heavy
                            industries that could be turned to arms production.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Wong said that the Ministry of Education participated with the
                            Ministry of Economics in the Industrial Reconstruction Planning
                            Conference and that the Minister of Communications had a representative
                            present, though he could not attend himself.</p>
                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Comment:</hi> As Dr. Wong was able to spare only twenty
                            minutes, I was not able to question him as closely as I should have
                            liked. I got the impression that he would prefer to avoid the
                            responsibility of deciding what might be given out, but he agreed to
                            think it over and talk to me about it again in a few days. Though he
                            insisted that the 140 proposals were of no particular importance, I got
                            the impression that he was reluctant to discuss them, at least until the
                            Generalissimo and the Executive Yuan have had a chance to consider them.
                            Dr. C. C. Chien, Vice Chairman of the National Resources Commission,
                            with whom I discussed the Industrial Reconstruction Planning Conference
                            last week, obviously did not feel that he could give out any information
                            about it without permission.</p>

                    <p>It will be observed that, according to the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>,
                        the South Seas Chinese are primarily interested in recovering their
                        properties after the war and in improving their legal status in the various
                        areas where they have their enterprises. They feel that in the past they
                        have not been given equality of treatment in most of the political entities
                        of the South Seas and south-east Asia.</p>
                    <p>With regard to their own post-war policies, the principal speaker at the
                        meeting mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> urged that overseas
                        Chinese devote their capital and energies to rebuilding Chinese enterprises
                        in <pb n="857" xml:id="pg_857" facs="0867"/>the South Seas, thus cooperating
                        with the reconstruction effort at home by supplying various materials needed
                        in China and by helping in the distribution of Chinese goods, rather than by
                        investing their money in industry in China.</p>

                        no. 1175, May 12, and other despatches on the subject of post-war
                        reconstruction plans for China.</p>
                    <p>There is enclosed herewith a memorandum<note n="22" xml:id="d776fn22">Not
                            printed.</note> of a conversation between Dr. Wong Wen-hao, Minister of
                        Economic Affairs, and the Commercial Attaché, from which it will be observed
                        that a program based on an annual production of 2,000,000 tons of steel is
                        regarded by Dr. Wong as practical, from both the technical and financial
                        points of view. A quarter of this proposed production would be needed to
                        build 5,000 kilometers of railway lines annually and supply the bodies for
                        freight cars to be used on those lines. A substantial amount would be used
                        to build small ships, of 100 to 500 tons, for inland transportation, and
                        ship yards equipped to repair ships of all sizes. Ships for coastal traffic
                        would be bought abroad and Dr. Wong does not believe that China will attempt
                        to compete in trans-oceanic transportation.</p>
                    <p>Agriculture’s greatest needs, according to Dr. Wong, are irrigation and
                        fertilizer. Chemical plants will be needed to produce fertilizer and other
                        heavy chemicals.</p>
                    <p>Production of machines will be most important in building up industry in
                        China but so far this element of the industrialization program has not been
                        considered in any detail. As a first step, a number of Chinese engineers now
                        in the United States on various missions, or shortly to proceed there, are
                        to study American factory methods and make suggestions as to their
                        application to China’s industrialization program.</p>
                    <p>While Dr. Wong insisted that he was speaking only as an individual, it is
                        probable that his remarks, so far as they went, represented the position of
                        the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Industrialization Reconstruction
                        Conference.</p>

                        Association of Labor represents an independent labor movement.</p>
                    <p>There is enclosed a memorandum<note n="24" xml:id="d777fn24">Not
                            printed.</note> of a conversation of June 10 between Mr. Chu and an
                        officer of the Embassy on the subject of the Chinese labor movement. Mr.
                        Chu, as it will be observed from this memorandum, stated that his
                        organization is cooperating in every way with the government during the war.
                        He pointed out, however, that the Shanghai General Labor Union, of which the
                        CAL is an outgrowth, staged a general strike in 1932, and indicated that the
                        CAL is prepared to resort to strikes to gain its ends, after the war. While
                        he does not have statistics of total factory labor in Free China, he
                        believes that the 422,000 members of the CAL represent about half the
                        workmen in factories employing over 30 men, and feels that they will have a
                        very substantial influence.</p>
                    <p>Asked as to the results secured thus far by the labor movement, Mr. Chu
                        admitted that they have not been very considerable. He said that some very
                        good laws have been passed but none of them have ever been enforced. Chinese
                        factory owners have in the past used extraterritoriality as an excuse for
                        ignoring the laws, claiming that foreign factories were not bound by them. A
                        much-needed law has just been passed providing for inspection of mines, but
                        Mr. Chu does not have much confidence that it will be enforced during the
                        present circumstances. After the war, he hopes that conditions will
                        improve.</p>

                        China Information Committee for June 12, 1943,<note n="25" xml:id="d778fn25">Not reprinted.</note> proposing that agriculture be made the basis of
                        post-war reconstruction in China.</p>
                    <p>This article, a condensation of an article originally published in the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi>, an influential independent Chungking
                        newspaper, and written by Tung Shih-tsin, a well-known Chinese
                        agriculturalist, is of particular interest because the agricultural point of
                        view is rarely presented in discussions of post-war reconstruction. As the
                        farmer is inarticulate and farming is unspectacular, it is natural that
                        plans for large-scale industrialization should have a greater appeal to the
                        imagination of writers and planners. A realistic reminder that agriculture
                        is and must continue to be the first industry of China should serve a useful
                        purpose.</p>
                    <p>The point is made in the article that industrial development in China after
                        the war will depend on the availability of raw materials, including many of
                        agricultural origin. An adequate textile industry, it is asserted, cannot be
                        built up on China’s production of a little over a million bales of cotton
                        and 50 million pounds of wool a year. The importance of agricultural
                        production to other industries is equally obvious. With the progress of
                        chemistry in the development of synthetic materials, including plastics, the
                        reliance of industry on agriculture is greatly increased.</p>
                    <p>China, it is stated in the article, does not produce enough food and textile
                        material for its own needs. The production of seven major agricultural
                        products in Szechuan is said to have shown a downward trend since 1939. The
                        first step toward becoming a modern country is to elevate the standard of
                        living and this must be done by assuring the people enough food and
                        clothing. The success of industries, moreover, will depend on the prosperity
                        of the farming districts, which will be the principal markets for the
                        products of industry.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to enclose a copy of despatch
                        no. 16 of June 27, 1943 from the Embassy’s officer at Sian,<note n="26" xml:id="d779fn26">Everett F. Drumright, Second Secretary of Embassy in
                            China; despatch not printed.</note> in which he reports the arrival at
                        Sian of the Northwest Reconstruction Investigation Commission.</p>
                    <p>It is stated in the despatch that following the Generalissimo’s trip to the
                        Northwest in 1942, General Chiang conceived great hopes for the future
                        development of that area and, as a consequence, despatched the Commission to
                        proceed to Shensi, Kansu, Ninghsia, Chinghai and Sinkiang to investigate
                        conditions on the spot as well as to prepare a long-term reconstruction plan
                        for these provinces. Reliable information indicated that the Commission
                        planned to remain in Sian for about one week and that its “investigation”
                        would merely comprise the gathering of data from various organizations which
                        would be utilized to prepare the comprehensive plan apparently desired by
                        the Generalissimo.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Drumright states that according to press reports, members of the
                        Commission investigated water conservancy, reclamation, soil, geography,
                        highway, health and educational conditions in the Sian area. It is indicated
                        in the despatch that apparently the members have neither the time nor the
                        capacity to make detailed investigations regarding agricultural,
                        conservancy, communication, industrial, education, health and other matters
                        that need to be examined and correlated if reconstruction of the Northwest
                        is to be attained.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion Mr. Drumright states that the recent attention focused on the
                        Northwest is considered to be partly strategical, and that increasing
                        attention will probably be given to bringing Sinkiang within the direct
                        political and economic control of the National Government.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to transmit herewith a copy
                        of an article appearing in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Bulletin</hi> of the
                        China Information Committee for June 24, 1943,<note n="27" xml:id="d780fn27">Not reprinted.</note> summarizing an address made at a meeting of the
                        China Social and Economic Reconstruction Association by Dr. Y. C. Koo,
                        Acting Vice Minister of Finance and General Manager of the Farmer’s
                        Bank.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Koo emphasizes the importance of rural industries in the reconstruction
                        of China’s economy, pointing out that such industries would give both
                        full-time and part-time employment in the over-crowded farming districts,
                        increasing the prosperity of those districts and making unnecessary a
                        movement of the rural population to the cities to seek work. Rural
                        industrialization would also alleviate the transportation problem to some
                        extent, if mills were planned with a view to using locally-available raw
                        materials and selling in nearby markets. (A list showing the various
                        provinces to which certain industries are suited is given in the
                        article.)</p>
                    <p>Rural industrialization, according to Dr. Koo, would modernize the farm
                        districts and improve farming methods by increasing production of farm
                        implements, fertilizer, insecticides etc. and by making the farmers
                        sufficiently prosperous to purchase these and other products. Hydroelectric
                        power is to be made available by a Rural Hydraulic Power Company, which the
                        Farmers Bank and the National Conservancy Commission are preparing to
                        organize.</p>
                    <p>Some observers believe that there will be a movement of industry back to the
                        former treaty ports and other large industrial centers after the war and
                        that such suggestions as those advanced by Dr. Koo, meritorious though they
                        seem, will be given inadequate attention. It may be noted, however, that in
                        various districts of Free China which were not industrialized to any extent
                        before the war, there are now a number of factories engaged in the
                        production of a wide variety of goods. In Shensi, for example, a cotton and
                        wheat-growing province, a number of cotton and flour mills have recently
                        started production. Kweilin, in Kwangsi Province, has developed into a
                        fairly important industrial center and several towns in Hunan are active
                        industrially, despite the proximity of enemy forces. Szechuan Province has
                        nearly half the factories in Free China, centered around Chungking and
                        Chengtu, and Yunnan Province has a number of active industries.</p>
                    <pb n="863" xml:id="pg_863" facs="0873"/>
                    <p>The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives has about 1600 member cooperatives,
                        located in cities and villages all over Free China and producing a wide
                        variety of goods. While some of these industries will undoubtedly be moved
                        back to the port cities after the war, it is believed that most of them will
                        remain and serve as a nucleus for a possible industrial decentralization
                        program. The growth of village and farm industries will probably depend on
                        the success of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, now undergoing a drastic
                        reorganization.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to report that a despatch
                        dated July 24, 1943, has been received from the Consulate General at
                        Kunming, in which reference is made to the interest of a group of prominent
                        Chinese political figures in acquiring second-hand machinery from the United
                        States for use in the post-war economic rehabilitation of China.</p>
                    <p>The group, which is said to include Dr. H. H. Kung, is reported to be
                        operating through a company styled the China Industrial Corporation, of
                        which a Mr. C. C. Chang is the director. The members of the group, it is
                        said, prefer to remain anonymous for the present, as they have not decided
                        whether the venture should be for the account of the government or for their
                        private account. The Chinese Industrial Corporation is reported to have at
                        least US$100,000 at its disposal for the immediate purchase of used
                        machinery in the United States, delivery presumably to be made as soon as
                        possible after the war. The purpose in making purchases at this time would
                        appear to be to forestall competition from other countries that are expected
                        to be in the market for industrial machinery after the war.</p>
                    <p>The Embassy was recently approached by Mr. Shen Li-ren, an accountant from
                        Shanghai, who claimed to be representing a group of wealthy Chinese in
                        Shanghai interested in the promotion of a scheme for the post-war
                        industrialization of China, under which American companies would supply used
                        machinery and Chinese capitalists would supply capital, in exchange for
                        shares in manufacturing companies to be formed in China. The scheme was
                        grandiose and impractical, but illustrates another aspect of the interest in
                        China in obtaining American machinery after the war.</p>
                    <pb n="864" xml:id="pg_864" facs="0874"/>
                    <p>Further evidence of Chinese interest in American machinery is afforded by a
                        number of inquiries received from manufacturers or promoters who desire to
                        place orders for new or used American machinery at this time, for delivery
                        as soon as possible after the war. Some of these inquirers indicate that
                        they would be prepared to deposit cash with their orders, in order to be
                        assured of priority in post-war delivery.</p>

                    <p>1164. An Associated Press item from Chungking under date August 11 quoted a
                        proposal submitted by Dr. Kung to the Executive Yuan suggesting that “the
                        Executive Yuan instruct the ministries concerned to draft new regulations
                        providing due protection of law so that foreign capital and technique might
                        be utilized fully in our national program of reconstruction.”</p>
                    <p>The Department will appreciate receiving information and comment regarding
                        this proposal in a brief telegram to be expanded into a mail despatch if
                        sufficient information is obtainable. Adler may be of assistance in
                        supplying information and comment.</p>

                        1607, August 31.<note n="28" xml:id="d783fn28">Latter not printed; referring
                            to Department’s telegram No. 1164, it stated: “It is understood that
                            matter is only in preliminary and tentative state at present and that
                            proposal in question has been referred to competent authorities for
                            drafting of appropriate regulations”. (893.50/330)</note> Dr. Kung’s
                        proposal in question was approved by the Executive Yuan in early August and
                        was referred to the Ministries of Finance, Communications and Economic
                        Affairs for the drafting of appropriate regulations. An informed Chinese
                        official states that the purpose of the proposal is to allay any fears
                        foreign investors of capital and technical personnel may have regarding <pb n="865" xml:id="pg_865" facs="0875"/>their status as a result of the
                        abolition of extraterritoriality. The Legislative Yuan is reported to have
                        appointed a special committee to study legislation to be adopted in order to
                        carry out Kung’s proposal.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is said to have
                        submitted recently to the Legislative Yuan the draft of a new patent law
                        under which registration of patents by aliens is to be effected. According
                        to informed opinion, such new law is not likely to be put into effect until
                        new Sino-foreign commercial treaties are concluded. We are endeavoring to
                        obtain a copy of the draft patent law for forwarding to the Department.</p>
                    <p>It is reliably reported that Kung will present a similar resolution to the
                        Central Executive Committee at its scheduled meeting beginning September 6.
                        The Chinese official mentioned in the first paragraph states that the
                        resolution will be more detailed than the proposal submitted to the
                        Executive Yuan and that it will probably give some indication of the types
                        of foreign investment desired and the conditions under which such investment
                        will be permitted.</p>
                    <p>Embassy will expect to report further when additional information is
                        available.</p>

                                    by the Government according to the principles laid down in the
                                    San Min Chu I and Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s industrial program.</p>
                                <p>The Central Government shall formulate a comprehensive nationwide
                                    plan for the establishment of industrial areas which is to be
                                    based upon the requirements of the national economy, existing
                                    communication facilities and the location of natural

                                    adopt the policy of emphasizing a simultaneous development of
                                    state and private industries which shall be operated on a

                                <p>Industries which may be entrusted to individuals, or industries
                                    which will be less suitable for the state to operate shall be
                                    privately operated. The Government in such cases shall give them
                                    encouragement and the protection of the law. Industries, the
                                    operation of which cannot be entrusted to individuals, or

                                    operated. The Government shall stipulate specifically what
                                    constitute state-owned industries, and what constitute private
                                    industries.</p>
                                <p>In order to increase international trade, export industries shall

                                the ration of foreign capital investment in joint enterprises. In
                                the organization of a Chinese-foreign joint enterprise, although the
                                chairman of the Board of Directors must be a Chinese the general
                                manager need not necessarily be a Chinese. The foregoing terms of
                                cooperation shall become effective after an agreement by the parties
                                concerned has been reached and the approval of the Government
                                secured. At the same time, aliens, in accordance with the provisions
                                of Chinese laws and regulations, and having received the sanction of
                                the Chinese Government, may invest in private enterprises in China.

                    <p>1729. CEC resolution on industrial reconstruction (Embassy’s 1728, September
                        16) apparently points to continuation and increase of Government monopolies
                        and control over industry which has been indicated in recent years. The
                        National Government is expected to reserve to itself heavy industry on
                        grounds of its relation to national defense, and to leave to private
                        enterprise light industry as less suitable to Government operation. The
                        resolution leaves to governmental decision which industries shall be private
                        enterprise, which state operated <pb n="867" xml:id="pg_867" facs="0877"/>and which state owned, and existing Government monopolies are therefore
                        expected to continue. The encouragement and protection of the law for
                        private industry envisaged in the resolution probably look toward protective
                        tariffs, the necessity for which the Chinese press has recently emphasized.
                        The establishment of Government socialized control of Chinese industry may
                        meet strong opposition from Chinese industrialists who during war time have
                        been powerless to prevent governmental encroachments in their field and who
                        may be expected to become more vocal after the war and their return to the
                        coastal areas.</p>
                    <p>It is likely that the recognized need for foreign capital in China’s
                        reconstruction caused the adoption of a relatively liberal policy toward
                        foreign investment and that it was felt desirable to take this step in order
                        to counteract many unofficial and semi-official press articles of extreme
                        nationalistic tone published in recent months. A responsible Chinese
                        official informs us that the resolution represents a genuine liberal
                        attitude among Government leaders toward foreign investment in China and,
                        necessarily, has Chiang Kai-shek’s hearty support. The adoption of this
                        policy toward foreign investment, together with the CEC resolution on
                        constitutional government,<note n="30" xml:id="d785fn30">See telegram No.
                            1706, September 14, <ref target="#pg_335">p. 335</ref>.</note> gives
                        further indication of the extent to which the Chinese Government is
                        dependent upon the United States and is sensitive to American criticism.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir</hi>: I have the honor to refer to the Embassy’s
                        telegrams nos. 1728 and 1729, both of September 16, 1943, in regard to the
                        C.E.C. resolutions on industrial reconstruction and foreign investments, and
                        to transmit herewith a translation, taken from the English edition of the
                        Central News Agency of September 11, 1943,<note n="31" xml:id="d786fn31">Not
                            reprinted.</note> of a resolution approved on that date by the Central
                        Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, proposing a policy for the treatment
                        of foreign investments in China.</p>
                    <p>An officer of the Embassy was recently informed by a responsible Chinese
                        official that this resolution, which was introduced by Dr. H. H. Kung, Vice
                        President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was originally
                        drafted by the Central Planning Board and <pb n="868" xml:id="pg_868" facs="0878"/>was approved by the Executive Yuan before its introduction
                        at the plenary session of the C.E.C. It is also said to have received the
                        hearty approval of General Chiang Kai-shek. It may therefore be said to
                        represent a declaration of official policy on the question of foreign
                        investments. It will be sent by the Central Executive Committee to the
                        Executive Yuan, according to the informant, which will recommend to the
                        Legislative Yuan the legislation necessary to implement its provisions. It
                        is not possible at this time to say when such legislation may be expected to
                        be enacted.</p>
                    <p>The proposals made in the resolution, as interpreted by a Chinese official
                        who was actively concerned in the drafting, are as follows: <list>
                            <label>1.</label>
                            <item>The present limit of 49 per cent on foreign participation in
                                companies jointly owned by Chinese and foreign investors should be
                                removed and no limit placed on foreign financial participation,
                                provided the investors agree and the approval of the government is
                                obtained.</item>
                            <label>2.</label>
                            <item>The present requirement that the general manager of such jointly
                                owned companies must be a Chinese should be repealed. Sino-foreign
                                companies should be permitted to choose foreign general managers,
                                with governmental approval. The Chairman of the Board of Directors
                                should be a Chinese, however.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>Aliens, with the approval of the Chinese Government and subject to
                                the provisions of Chinese laws and regulations, should be permitted
                                to make direct investments in China.</item>
                            <label>4.</label>
                            <item>Private individuals and firms should conduct their own
                                negotiations for foreign loans, the arrangements arrived at to be
                                subject to government approval.</item>
                            <label>5.</label>
                            <item>Negotiations for foreign loans by state enterprises should be
                                placed under unified control.</item>
                            <label>6.</label>
                            <item>The government should decide at any early date which categories of
                                state enterprises may be permitted to sell shares to foreign
                                investors and which categories may invite foreign capital only in
                                the form of loans.</item>
                        </list>
               </p>
                    <p>According to the informant, the resolution as drafted by the Central Planning
                        Board and approved by the Executive Yuan, was more detailed and specific
                        than that adopted by the C.E.C. A committee of the C.E.C. preferred that it
                        should be “a little more general” but did not alter the spirit of it. The
                        informant did not care to say what specific points had been taken out but it
                        is believed that there was originally some reference in the resolution to
                        foreign concessions for the exploitation of natural resources.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the resolution is said to be clarification of the situation
                        caused by the abolition of extraterritoriality and assurance to foreign
                        capital of protection and opportunity to invest in China. It is probable
                        that an official declaration of a relatively liberal character was felt
                        desirable as a means of counteracting the considerable volume of unofficial
                        and semi-official articles of an ultra-nationalistic nature <pb n="869" xml:id="pg_869" facs="0879"/>which have been published in China in
                        recent months, in view of the recognized need for foreign capital in China.
                        It will be noted that the concessions proposed in the resolution are in each
                        case limited by a provision requiring government approval, which, in the
                        hands of an illiberal administration, might conceivably be used to nullify
                        those concessions. It is probable that foreign capital will place less
                        confidence in resolutions, or even in such laws and regulations as may be
                        passed to implement them, than in the manner in which they are enforced and
                        the general attitude of Chinese officials toward foreigners and foreign
                        business. It is believed, nevertheless, that the Kung resolution gives an
                        encouraging indication of the recognition by key Chinese officials of the
                        need for foreign capital and of the fact that such capital will not be
                        attracted by chauvinistic pronouncements.</p>

                        <p>
                     <hi rend="italic">Summary:</hi> The Group of over 20 members, arrived at
                            Tihwa on August 11 by automobile, proceeded to Ining (Kuldja), returned
                            to Tihwa, departed for Kashgar on September 5, and are expected back in
                            Tihwa in mid-October. The leader, Dr. Lo Chia-lun (concurrently
                            Supervisory Commissioner designate for Sinkiang), returned to Chungking
                            about September 4, assumably to attend the Central Executive Committee
                            meeting, but will probably go again to Sinkiang to assume his
                            supervisory duties. The members of the Group (whose names and titles are
                            appended to the despatch) are men of standing in their respective fields
                            and their trip should result in the collection of useful data. The local
                            press has evinced little interest in the party. The one pertinent
                            editorial might be interpreted to mean that Kuomintang officials are
                            welcome in Sinkiang only if they are in position to benefit the
                            province. Two other investigation groups are now in Sinkiang: one of
                            scientists from the Academia Sinica and the other—a possible rival of
                            the Northwest Reconstruction Investigation Group—the Investigation Group
                            of the Sun Yat Sen Society. Kuomintang postwar planning is generally
                            impractical, assuming as it does that implementation of the plans
                            evolved will be effected, apparently <pb n="870" xml:id="pg_870" facs="0880"/>gratis, by the victorious United Nations, especially
                            the United States.<note n="33" xml:id="d787fn33">In a memorandum dated
                                December 14, 1943, Granville O. Woodard of the Division of Far
                                Eastern Affairs pointed out that Consul Clubb’s despatch “includes
                                the following interesting footnote: ‘One can already discern in
                                contemporary Kuomintang thought the outlines of an argument which
                                may get greater emphasis in the post-war reconstruction period: i.
                                e., China has had restored to it a legal international equality, but
                                its subjection for a century to “imperialistic domination” has
                                retarded its economic development and strict justice requires that
                                in compensation it shall be given economic equality as well, that
                                is, that the economically advanced nations shall contribute of their
                                power and goods until the Chinese economy is brought up to the
                                general level of their own. This argument of course has no reference
                                to natural resources, ratio of population to land, and other
                                economic factors which would receive attention in a scientific
                                consideration of the subject’.”</note>

                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <p>Mr. Smith’s despatch is summarized as follows: The Central News article
                            urges that sufficient protection be given foreign capital to ensure its
                            safety but that there be restrictions to prevent manipulation and
                            abuses; utilization of foreign capital should be directed by the
                            government and direct investment should not be permitted. An article in
                            the May 1943 issue of <hi rend="italic">The New Economics</hi> holds
                            that “the key to the utilization of foreign capital is for us to hold
                            the sovereignty and management control in our hands” and urges that
                            direct investment not be permitted. The Hsinmin <hi rend="italic">Evening News</hi>, placing the amount needed for industrial
                            reconstruction at CN $5,000,000,000 plus US $5,000,000,000, suggests
                            that the latter amount be raised abroad by a special committee in the
                            form of long term credits to be refunded by installments. These articles
                            give some support to statements that the trend in China is toward
                            government monopoly of major economic enterprises and the exclusion of
                            foreign influence, but it is believed that many influential Chinese
                            financial leaders realize that there are limits to the advantages of

                    <p>The enclosed excerpt from an article in the English edition of the Central
                        News Agency Bulletin of August 25, 1943 urges that foreign <pb n="871" xml:id="pg_871" facs="0881"/>capital be directed into the most useful
                        channels by the government, with direct investments prohibited except by
                        special permission, and that, where foreign management is permitted, there
                        be a provision requiring training of Chinese personnel to take over the
                        management after a specified period. Mr. Chang Ju-kiang, an economic writer
                        in an article in the <hi rend="italic">Hsin Min Pao</hi> of September 19,
                        1943, an excerpt from which is enclosed, argues for strict control of
                        foreign enterprises but does not ask for prohibition of direct investments
                        of foreign capital, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang having
                        already gone on record, before the publication of his article, as favoring
                        direct investments. Mr. Kao Ping-shu, in an economic article in the <hi rend="italic">Ta Kung Pao</hi> of September 12, 1943, reviewed in the
                            <hi rend="italic">Daily Bulletin</hi> of the China Information Committee
                        of September 17, 1943 (a copy of which is enclosed), estimates that China
                        will need US $6,500,000,000 of foreign capital in the first five years of
                        reconstruction and sees no need for special restrictions on foreign
                        investment, as foreign capital and foreign factories will be subject to
                        Chinese laws and regulations. It is probable that Mr. Kao’s article was
                        written after the announcement (September 11, 1943) of the CEC resolution
                        favoring a liberal attitude toward foreign capital (Embassy’s despatch no.
                        1595, September 18, 1943).</p>
                    <p>The CEC resolution, favoring removal of restrictions against foreign control
                        of Sino-foreign companies, permission for direct investments in China by
                        aliens and permission for private firms to conduct their own negotiations
                        for foreign capital (all subject to government approval), was apparently
                        intended to counteract the effect of nationalistic articles such as most of
                        the enclosed, and to reassure foreign investors. As a pronouncement of
                        official and party policy, it should have a considerable effect on future
                        articles in Chinese publications, on the subject of the utilization of
                        foreign capital.</p>
                    <p>According to an official of the Ministry of Finance, a proposal for the
                        organization of an insurance company to be controlled by the government
                        banks, which would have been granted a monopoly of reinsurance on government
                        properties, has been shelved because of the fear that it might be disturbing
                        to foreign opinion. Embassy’s A–65, Sept. 27, 1943.<note n="36" xml:id="d788fn36">

                            the Chinese Central Government toward monopoly control of all major
                            economic enterprise and the exclusion of foreigners from such
                            enterprises, but it is believed that many of the most influential
                            Chinese financial leaders realize that there are limits to the practical

                    <p>1860. Chinese Government’s highly developed interest in postwar
                        reconstruction, which we have previously discussed, is reflected anew in
                        current reports that a special branch of the Government, possibly a new
                        Yuan, is to be established for purpose of formulating and putting into
                        effect definite plans for postwar reconstruction in China. According to some
                        sources, T. V. Soong who is expected to reach Chungking by end of this week
                        may head the new organization, at least nominally (it seems to be generally
                        believed that he will not relinquish his post as Foreign Minister or remain
                        for an extended time in Chungking). Part of plan if put into effect will
                        assumably include (as it apparently already has in the past) obtaining
                        Lend-Lease supplies having postwar utility.</p>

                        accompanied by Atcheson and found suitable opportunity, in response to his
                        inquiries as to American post-war plans, to give emphasis to the
                        determination with which the American Government and people are devoting
                        themselves to the primary task of achieving complete victory involving
                        unconditional surrender by Germany and Japan and to say that we looked to
                        our Allies including China to cooperate to that end with all the effort and
                        resources at their command. He said that China can be counted upon to do her
                        share.</p>
                    <p>The conversation lasted 50 minutes and Chiang was most cordial in welcoming
                        me back and in his attitude throughout. Of the many questions he put to me
                        it was apparent that his chief interest lay in those relating to the
                        possibility of continuing Russian collaboration during and after the war, to
                        American post-war plans and to the capacity of Americans and Chinese for
                        friendly cooperation.</p>
                    <p>I took occasion to convey to the Generalissimo cordial greetings from
                        President Roosevelt and Secretary Hull and to offer congratulations on his
                        election to the Presidency of the Chinese Government.</p>

                        final paragraph. Dr. Wang Chung-hui, Secretary General of the National
                        Defense Council and former Foreign Minister, has stated to an officer of the
                        Embassy in private conversation that he hopes and expects that after the war
                        the Chinese Government will issue a mandate of general amnesty for Chinese
                        puppet officials in the occupied areas. He said that of course some of the
                        leaders would have to be punished—Wang Ching-wei most certainly although
                        Chen Kung-po, “Mayor” of Greater Shanghai, would be a “doubtful” case.</p>
                    <p>As Wang Chung-hui is one of the President’s closest advisers it is not
                        unlikely that his statements reflect the trend of General Chiang’s thought
                        in the matter.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Chang<note n="41" xml:id="d792fn41">Chang Kia-ngau, former Chinese
                            Minister of Communications and head of the Bank of China.</note> invited
                        me to call on him at the Mayflower Hotel where he had very recently arrived
                        from China. He and I were good personal friends during my stay in
                        Chungking.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chang described at some length his years of connection with the Chinese
                        Government and with the Bank of China and his services with the Kuomintang.
                        He had been opposed to the Banjs of China becoming a government institution
                        and had ceased to be head of the Bank as a protest against Dr. Kung’s and
                        Dr. Soong’s plans for bringing the Bank more or less under Government
                        control.</p>
                    <pb n="874" xml:id="pg_874" facs="0884"/>
                    <p>His resignation last year as Minister of Communications was due to a desire
                        to take a needed rest for health reasons but I gather that he was not in
                        accord with plans for communications development.</p>
                    <p>He is in the United States officially as an Adviser to the Executive Yuan. He
                        has, however, a personal commission from President Chiang Kai-shek to
                        investigate and report to President Chiang in regard to American
                        collaboration in post-war reconstruction in China. His explorations will
                        follow in general three lines: American financial and material support for
                        Chinese Government plans for reconstruction; collaboration between private
                        American and Chinese interests in the development of China; and development
                        of Chinese-American foreign trade. He feels strongly that there is an
                        opportunity outside of the Chinese Government’s plans, for American and
                        Chinese businessmen to get together on a mutually profitable basis for the
                        development of China.</p>
                    <p>We talked for some time with regard to the form and line that Chinese
                        industrial development should take. I pointed out the need for a coordinated
                        plan for Chinese development (at present each Ministry and special
                        organization of the Government has its own scheme for development). I also
                        mentioned the need that reconstruction enterprises be directly related to
                        China’s economic situation; that China had an agrarian economy and that any
                        industrial development that did not take this fact into consideration would
                        be unsound. I also said that, in so far as possible, industrial enterprises
                        should be self-liquidating. I said that these were phases of the matter in
                        which I had found Americans interested.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Chang readily agreed. He said that it was along these broad lines that he
                        expected to conduct his conversations in America. He admitted that there was
                        too much talk now of the development of heavy industries; that greater
                        emphasis should be placed upon raising the income of the agricultural
                        population and on the development of light industries to supply consumers
                        goods to the Chinese people. He said that he was not here to ask the
                        American Government or American businessmen to “give” China something; that
                        he was here to develop the thought that close economic association between
                        China and the United States could prove beneficial to the peoples of both
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Chang said that he was going to Boston for a general check up and a rest;
                        that in about a month he would return to Washington at which time he hoped
                        to call on Mr. Hull, Mr. Acheson,<note n="42" xml:id="d792fn42">Dean G.
                            Acheson, Assistant Secretary of State.</note> Mr. Morgenthau and Mr.

                        President Chiang had suggested that he make these calls. Afterwards he
                        intends to discuss <pb n="875" xml:id="pg_875" facs="0885"/>with American
                        officials and businessmen his ideas for post-war economic collaboration
                        between China and the United States.</p>
                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: Mr. Chang is generally looked upon in China
                        as a man of sound judgement. He is conservative in politics and business. I
                        doubt that he is in position to speak with much authority in so far as
                        Chinese Government interests are concerned but he does represent a typical
                        Chinese businessman-banker’s point of view and in that respect it may be
                        useful to hear what he has to say. He expects to be in America about one

                            much reliance on foreign capital in its economic reconstruction program.
                            The United States, Great Britain and Russia are spending enormous sums
                            in the prosecution of the war. Russia is unlikely to be willing to
                            export capital after the war, Great Britain has mortgaged her future and
                            the United States will be faced with a tremendous problem of
                            rehabilitation at home and in Europe as well as in the Far East. Such
                            capital as is available for China will have to be carefully guided into
                            the most useful channels. Most of it will probably be invested in state
                            enterprises rather than in private companies. Foreign capital will
                            undoubtedly seek investment in China and will be welcomed, but the
                            greater emphasis should be laid on the investment of foreign brains and
                            technical knowledge. <hi rend="italic">End of summary</hi>.</p>

                        flow of capital from the United States. The Minister of Economic Affairs, in
                        a private conversation with an officer of the Embassy some two months ago,
                        expressed the opinion that China would have to <pb n="876" xml:id="pg_876" facs="0886"/>provide at least half the cost of reconstruction, but he

                        No. 8 of September 30, 1943, from the Secretary on detail at Lanchow<note n="45" xml:id="d794fn45">Edward E. Rice; despatch not printed.</note> in
                        regard to Chinese hope for American aid in the economic development of
                        northwest China and to certain obstacles to such development.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rice’s despatch contains an adequate summary.</p>
                    <p>It is generally felt that the primary consideration of the Central Government
                        authorities motivating their plans for the economic development of the
                        Northwest is a strategic one: the creation of a buffer region against Soviet
                        Russia. The Soviet withdrawal from Sinkiang and the presence of the Chinese
                        Communists in northwest China have brought sharply to the attention of the
                        Chinese authorities the strategic situation of this territory at a time when
                        circumstances have permitted an extension of Chungking’s authority into a
                        hitherto autonomous area. It is inevitable that the strategic implications
                        would color Chinese thinking and planning with respect to the Northwest.
                        Other considerations, again timely and somewhat urgent, have been the
                        problems presented by the famine situation in Honan where large numbers of
                        famine refugees were either leaving the province or because of their
                        destitute condition required some form of relief. The settlement in the
                        Northwest of these famine victims, who were without land or means, has
                        provided a method by which the areas might become more Chinese in character
                        and at the same time dove-tailed with the buffer region plan of
                        development.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rice seems to have given an accurate description of the obstacles to the
                        economic development of this area with which the Chinese are confronted.
                        After the war the Chinese will likely be required to devote themselves to
                        the much more vital and profitable rehabilitation and development of the
                        coastal and central China areas now occupied by the Japanese and it is
                        difficult to believe that the Central Government will be prepared,
                        financially or psychologically, to undertake any real and lasting
                        development of the Northwest for some time to come.</p>

                     <hi rend="italic">Summary of enclosure:</hi> Among China’s allies,
                            especially the United States, there is current a mistaken sentiment in
                            regard to the institutional position of the Japanese Emperor, devolving
                            from an erroneous notion which attributes to him a position of spiritual
                            and moral leadership to which all Japanese pay unquestioned respect and
                            which they regard with blind reverence. There is also a mistaken
                            conception that the Japanese Emperor is all powerful and able to control
                            all Japanese elements, or that he will fulfil the role of a modifying
                            and liberal influence. The Japanese Emperor and the cult of emperor
                            worship should be overthrown when the Japanese are defeated. The victory
                            over Japan must be decisive so as to preclude any resurrection of a
                            militaristic and aggressive Japan and Japan must be beaten and crushed
                            so that she will not dare entertain an aggressive thought for a hundred
                            years. This can be done only by a fundamental revolution whereby the
                            Imperial rule of Japan is ended forever. When Japan is finally occupied
                            and the Emperor deposed and banished, it will devolve upon the United
                            Nations, principally the United States and China, to set up organs of
                            control and advice whereby democratic institutions will be introduced
                            and developed. China need have no fear of a democratic Japan and such a
                            Japan must and will take her rightful place among the law-abiding and

                    <p>At a press conference on October 13, 1943, Dr. K. C. Wu, Vice Minister of
                        Foreign Affairs, was asked whether the views expressed by Dr. Sun in the
                        enclosed article represented the views of the Chinese Government. According
                        to the official Central News Agency, Dr. Wu <pb n="878" xml:id="pg_878" facs="0888"/>replied to the effect that Dr. Sun’s opinions undoubtedly
                        coincided with those of a large number of people in China and that a
                        democratic Japan after the war would undoubtedly be a benefit to the world
                        as well as to herself but that the conditions and requirements to be imposed
                        on a defeated Japan could only be made known after consultations among the
                        United Nations engaged in the war against Japan.</p>
                    <p>In spite of Dr. Wu’s tactful refusal to admit that the views expressed by Dr.
                        Sun represented those held by the Chinese Government, it is believed that
                        this is actually the case.…</p>
                    <p>Opinions similar to those expressed by Dr. Sun were given by Dr. Ho
                        Feng-shan, Director of the Information Department, Ministry of Foreign
                        Affairs, in a conversation with an officer of the Embassy on October 20,
                        1943. Dr. Ho stated that, in his opinion, at least 90 percent of all
                        informed Chinese endorsed Dr. Sun’s proposal to depose the Japanese Emperor
                        and that almost complete unanimity on this point existed in the Foreign
                        Office. According to Dr. Ho, Chinese Government officials generally believe
                        that a Japanese Emperor in the post-war world would be a “nuisance” as he
                        would be the prime obstacle to the development of a democratic Japan which
                        China so much desires; that the Emperor would be a constant reminder of the
                        humiliation and defeat inflicted upon Japan by the United Nations and that
                        there was no reason to believe that he might not again be used by the
                        Japanese militarists for the advancement of their ideas. Among informed
                        Chinese, Dr. Ho stated, the Emperor was generally considered to be just as
                        responsible as the militarists for Japan’s aggressive actions.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Ho stated that Great Britain apparently favored retention of the Emperor
                        whereas the Soviet Union, which might have to be consulted in regard to
                        post-war treatment of Japan, is reportedly in favor of having him deposed
                        for the possible reason that a democratic Japan might become interested in
                        Communism. Dr. Ho expressed the hope that the United States would support
                        China in advocating the deposing of the Emperor.</p>

                           <p>On this point Mr.
                                        Davies’ memorandum reads as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">
                                            <p>“When Manchuria’s fate becomes evident, Mr.… asked,
                                                what line will the United States follow. I asked if
                                                he meant by Manchuria’s fate that the Russians would
                                                occupy that area. He replied in the affirmative. I
                                                said that I did not think that we would fight the
                                                Russians on that issue.</p>
                                            <p>I asked Mr.… what he thought the fate of Korea would
                                                be. He replied that he expected Korea to be a
                                                kingdom. I asked why it would not be an autonomous
                                                Soviet Republic. He explained that an agreement
                                                would probably be reached before long by which
                                                borders would be established as of the period before
                                                the Russo-Japanese war. Thus, he felt, the Soviet
                                                Union would get its revenge for its defeat in 1905.
                                                I feel that this interpretation is an
                                                oversimplification.”</p>

                    <p>There is almost complete unanimity among British officials in New Delhi that
                        post-war Anglo-American collaboration is essential but one has a definite
                        feeling that they view British fighting in Asia as having the primary
                        purpose of re-establishing and extending British imperialist interests.
                        Distrust of the Chinese and fear of a strong and united post-war China are
                        characteristic of British officialdom here.</p>

                            <item>In the minds of most Americans a better world is identified with
                                the abolition of imperialism, and there is a very real danger that
                                the United States may again become isolationist after the war as a
                                result of a feeling by the American people that they have been made
                                dupes of British imperialism.</item>

                            <item>Our policy is apparently based on the conviction that we need
                                Britain as a first-class power; Britain cannot be a first-class
                                power without its empire; we are accordingly committed to the
                                support of the British empire.</item>
                            <label>3.</label>
                            <item>If Britain does not want the United States to go isolationist, it
                                must be careful to leave us some freedom to state our own case in
                                Asia.</item>

               </p>
                    <p>The Mission considers Mr. Davies’ appraisement of the consequences which may
                        be expected to flow from our apparent policy of supporting British aims in
                        Asia to be sound. It matters little whether this is our actual policy or
                        whether by our silence we allow that conclusion to be drawn by Asiatics. The
                        result is the same, namely, a growing conviction among the people of this
                        part of the world that American policy is at one with the British in
                        desiring the restoration and extension of “whitetocracy” in Asia. The
                        long-range consequence of such a conviction will, it would seem, be an
                        alignment of the colored races against the whites as their only hope of
                        freedom and progress.<note n="50" xml:id="d796fn50">
                     <p>On November 23, the
                                Adviser on Political Relations (Murray) commented: “Mr.…, as you
                                will note, goes in for ‘realism’ in a big way and does not allow his
                                style to be cramped by such things as the Four Freedoms and the
                                Atlantic Charter”.</p>
                            <p>In an attached memorandum dated November 24, the Assistant Secretary
                                of State (Berle) added: “I think Mr. Davies is probably getting into
                                pretty deep water. For one thing, I doubt if the British Empire is
                                going to exist solely because of our ‘commitment to recreate’ it. It
                                would equally be argued that Great Britain, by defending us against
                                the Germans, had ‘chosen’ to maintain the United States as a
                                first-class power.</p>
                            <p>The real problem, as it seems to me, is whether the purely
                                ‘imperialist’ line is in all respects the best way of securing that
                                international development which makes it possible for Britain to
                                continue to be a first-class power.</p>
                            <p>She might, as she has before, conceivably find that the commonwealth
                                idea proved a stronger policy than the ‘empire’ idea.”</p>
                            <p>A penciled notation by the Assistant Chief of the Division of Far
                                Eastern Affairs (Vincent) states: “I think Davies has something here
                                which should be circulated. Perhaps he is too pessimistic, but it
                                may well be that future historians will say ‘You were warned and did
                                nothing about it.’ On the other hand, who <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do anything about it. That is the
                            tragedy.”</p>

                            collection and translation into Chinese of foreign documents and
                            publications on postwar problems with the purpose of presenting to China

                            (2) the conducting of independent research work and the presentation of
                            reports on the various phases of postwar world cooperation and
                            reconstruction. A list of the works which are to be translated and

                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Memorandum</hi>
               </p>
                    <p>According to certain information which has come to the knowledge of the
                        Committee of National Liberation, Allied plans of operation in the Far East
                        would, in the near future, include the start of operations against the
                        frontiers of Indo-China, operations entrusted to Chinese troops.</p>
                    <p>The Washington Delegation of the Committee has already had occasion to call
                        the Department of State’s attention to the absolute importance to the Allied
                        cause of associating the competent French authorities with the detailing of
                        Allied war plans in the Far East, especially when their execution involves
                        French Indo-China. The aforementioned authorities possess, in this field,
                        documentation and experience which can be of the greatest use to the Allied
                        High Command. The role which France has traditionally played in the Far
                        East, the important interests which she has there, the dispositions already
                        taken by the Algiers Committee to participate when the time comes in the
                        struggle for the liberation of Indo-China, are all, as many more, reasons
                        for an effective French participation in Inter-Allied Councils where the
                        general strategy of the United Nations in the Far East is determined.</p>
                    <p>As concerns the project of a Chinese offensive against Indo-China, the
                        Algiers Committee—if the information which has reached it on this subject is
                        correct—must very seriously draw the attention of the American Government to
                        the great danger which its realization would present.</p>
                    <pb n="883" xml:id="pg_883" facs="0893"/>
                    <p>A Chinese attack against Tonkin would have the immediate effect of causing
                        the whole Indo-Chinese population to rise against the Allies.</p>
                    <p>For the Annamites, the Chinese, who have so frequently in the past invaded
                        and ravaged their frontier regions, represent the hereditary enemy. Far from
                        greeting them as liberators, the local population would impede their advance
                        by every means in their power. Moreover, the population and the French
                        troops, who would take the side of the Allies if it were French, American
                        and British forces which were coming to their help, might very well react
                        against an attack by the Chinese, whose true intentions could easily be
                        confused by enemy propaganda. The position which a Chinese attack apparently
                        will cause civilian and military French Indo-Chinese to take will in the
                        future be difficult to modify and the consequences of such a mistake run the
                        risk of weighing heavily upon the development of the campaign.</p>
                    <p>The French Committee of National Liberation believes, therefore, that it is
                        of the highest importance to set aside a project which, far from serving
                        Allied interests, runs the risk of causing the greatest harm. The Committee,
                        likewise, equally believes that, as concerns military operations whose
                        theatre would be French territory, it is imperative to ask the Allies that
                        no decision should be taken without our previous agreement.</p>

                    <p>M. Hoppenot came in to see me at his request. He handed me the attached
                            memorandum,<note n="3" xml:id="d799fn3">
                     <hi rend="italic">Supra</hi>.</note> which states that the French National Committee
                        understands that Chinese operations will presently open against the Japanese
                        within the frontiers of Indochina. This gave great concern to the Committee
                        of National Liberation. If Chinese troops attacked there, plainly there
                        would not be any support from the French, since the Chinese had always
                        claimed interest there, and it was not unlikely that the French troops would
                        defend against a Chinese attack.</p>
                    <p>I asked whether this matter had already been brought to the attention of the
                        Chiefs of Staff. M. Hoppenot said it had, through General <pb n="884" xml:id="pg_884" facs="0894"/>Bethouart. I thanked him for the
                        information and said that the matter presented was primarily for military
                        consideration.</p>

                     <hi rend="smallcaps">Note</hi>: But it is not only for military
                            consideration. This brings us squarely up to the problem of whether, in
                            the Far East, we are reestablishing the western colonial empires or
                            whether we are letting the East liberate itself if it can do so. I feel
                            that the matter should be discussed on a high level with the President
                            for his decision. I do not know that we need to settle matters with the
                            French Committee in Algiers. If the Chinese can clo anything against the
                            Japanese in French Indochina to the general advantage of the war, I have
                            difficulty in seeing why we should stop them.</p>

                    <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Stettinius</hi>: In connection with the application
                        of the French Committee of National Liberation for membership on the Pacific
                        War Council, it is of interest that the representative of the Committee
                        yesterday presented us with a request that we do not permit the Chinese to
                        take part in operations against the Japanese troops which are presently
                        occupying Indo-China. The Committee observed that if British and American
                        troops accomplished the reconquest this would be quite all right; but the
                        French, and particularly those in Indo-China, considered the Chinese as
                        their hereditary enemies (<hi rend="italic">erbfeinde</hi>); if they took
                        part in the liberation of Indo-China, probably they would claim new
                        territory.</p>
                    <p>The French would push this view in the Pacific War Council. This would
                        probably be supported by the British and the Dutch. This would present us,
                        for all practical purposes, with the task of reconquering Indo-China almost
                        single-handed (since the British interest stops with Burma) for the sole
                        purpose of returning Indo-China to France. France is unlikely to be able to
                        maintain herself in control of, or protect, that province for a good while;
                        so that we should have the added job of policing and protecting it against
                        the Chinese as well as the Japanese in the interest of the French Colonial
                        Empire.</p>
                    <p>It strikes me that this fact should be called to the attention of the
                        President and also of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<note n="4" xml:id="d800fn4">On October 29 Mr. Stettinius replied to Mr. Berle: “I agree with you
                            that the matter of French representation on the Pacific War Council and
                            also their request that the Chinese be asked not to conduct military
                            operations within Indo-China should be referred both to the President
                            and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.”</note> I think we should <pb n="885" xml:id="pg_885" facs="0895"/>answer the French Committee that their
                        representation will receive consideration, but that military factors must
                        predominate in the decision.</p>
                    <p>Frankly, I doubt if we could defend before the Congress a very considerable
                        expenditure of American lives for the sole purpose of keeping Indo-China in
                        French, as against Chinese or Indo-Chinese, hands.…</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Berle</hi>: We have read with keen interest your
                        memorandum of conversation with Mr. Hoppenot and his <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>, and concur in the opinion expressed in your
                        note.</p>
                    <p>There is at the bottom of page 1 of the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi>
                        the following statement which we feel should not pass without comment: “Pour
                        l’Annamite, les Chinois, qui ont si frequemment dans le passé envahi et
                        ravagé leurs régions frontieres, representent Pennemi héreditaire.” This
                        statement is grossly misleading, if not actually false. In 1879 the
                        Annamites sought military aid from China to drive out the French. It was
                        China’s weakness, not Annamite dislike or fear of China, that permitted the
                        French to remain. Recurrent waves of Annamite nationalism have looked to
                        Chinese nationalism for inspiration and guidance, particularly since 1920.
                        Today there is understood to be in southern China a group of Annamites which
                        advocates independence for Indochina and seeks Chinese support. It is our
                        belief that the Annamites, by and large, have for the Chinese a feeling of
                        friendliness and cultural affinity.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese Government’s attitude regarding the post-war status of Indochina
                        has been cautious. Officials of the Government have disclaimed territorial
                        ambitions but they have at times intimated that China would desire an
                        arrangement which assured access to the sea from Yunnan Province through
                        Tonkin to Haiphong. Independence for Indochina is included in the Chinese
                        Government’s general advocacy of self-government for eastern peoples.</p>
                    <pb n="886" xml:id="pg_886" facs="0896"/>
                    <p>The post-war status of French Indochina is a matter of speculation: return to
                        France; international control; and even British control. It is our belief
                        that the Annamites are fundamentally capable of self-government and that it
                        should be the objective of any post-war administration to train Annamites to
                        resume the responsibilities of self-government. This objective might be
                        achieved by a continuation of French administration for a definitely limited
                        period or by international administration. There would seem to be no
                        reasonable basis for British administration. In any event, the Chinese
                        Government should be consulted and its views given full consideration in
                        regard to plans for the future of Indochina.</p>

                    <p>M. Henri Hoppenot, the Delegate of the French Committee of National
                        Liberation, has left with the State Department a communication, a copy of
                        which in translation is attached hereto,<note n="7" xml:id="d802fn7">
                     <hi rend="italic">Ante</hi>, <ref target="#pg_882">p. 882</ref>.</note>
                        giving the reasons why, in the opinion of the Committee, it would be a
                        mistake to entrust to Chinese troops the launching of military operations
                        against Indo-China. The main reason advanced is that the Chinese are the
                        hereditary enemies of the Annamites and that an attack by the Chinese would
                        therefore be resisted by the local population as well as by French troops.
                        It is our belief that this presentation of the case involves allegations not
                        in accord with the facts, and that the Annamites, by and large, have for the
                        Chinese a feeling of friendliness and cultural affinity.</p>
                    <p>The problem to which these representations relates seems primarily to be a
                        military problem for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We understand that it has
                        already been brought to the attention of that body by General Bethouart,
                        Chief of the French Military Mission.</p>

                    <p>In regard to the use of Chinese troops against Annam, I agree with the State
                        Department that the French presentation of the case is not sufficiently
                        valid to take any action.</p>

                    <p>
                  <hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Mr. Berle</hi>: I have already had occasion to
                        speak to you of the interest which the French Committee of National
                        Liberation would attach to being associated in the inter-Allied
                        deliberations concerning the conduct of the war in the Far East,
                        particularly when it is a matter of operations which may involve Indochina.
                        I refer particularly to the <hi rend="italic">aide-mémoire</hi> which I
                        transmitted to you on this subject October 21, and which contemplated on the
                        one hand the entrance of a representative of the Committee into the Pacific
                        Council, and on the other hand the apprehensions caused at Algiers by a
                        proposed Chinese offensive against the frontier of Indochina.</p>
                    <p>M. Massigli has just requested me to recall this question again to your high
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>The cooperation of the French staff with the Allied staffs in the Far East
                        has as a matter of fact entered into a new phase following the sending to
                        Delhi, with the accord of the British War Office, of a French military
                        mission commanded by General Blaizot. This new fact seems to make it more
                        desirable that a parallel collaboration should be established at Washington,
                        by the association of a French representative in the deliberations of the
                        Pacific Council of which delegates of all the Powers participating in the
                        war effort against Japan are members.</p>
                    <p>We have learned, moreover, that the proposed Chinese operations on the
                        frontier of Indochina have not been abandoned and that irregular Chinese
                        troops, staffed by American officers, are said to be trained at the present
                        time for this purpose near the said frontier. The Chinese elements in
                        question are precisely the ones whose incursions and pillaging have
                        frequently created, in the course of recent decades, a state of insecurity
                        and trouble in that region, and their reappearance on Indochinese territory,
                        even with the corrective of a staff of American officers, would aggravate
                        further the repercussions of any Chinese action on those frontiers. Knowing
                        personally the mentality both of the French of Indochina and of the native
                        populations of the Union, <pb n="888" xml:id="pg_888" facs="0898"/>I am
                        convinced that nothing could more seriously hinder their cooperation with
                        the Allies than for the liberation of Indochina to appear to be entrusted,
                        even provisionally, to Chinese formations which, in the present case, would
                        appear to them not only as the advance guard of the hereditary enemy of
                        Annam and Tonkin, but as the direct descendants of the bands of pirates and
                        Jolly Rogers who have so long caused the threat of their exactions to weigh
                        upon those regions. Just as American or English troops would be welcomed as
                        allies and liberators, so we run the risk of seeing French and natives react
                        strongly against the use of these Chinese elements. I do not believe that a
                        more serious political and psychological fault could be committed and I take
                        the liberty to beg you to call this point again to the very serious
                        attention of the competent authorities.<note n="8" xml:id="d804fn8">On

                    <p>1230. General Bethouart, of the French Committee of National Liberation,
                        called at the Department and requested that the Department, through its
                        Embassy at Chungking, exert its influence in support of the effort being
                        made by the representative of the French Committee at Chungking to obtain
                        from the Chinese Government clarification of that Government’s intentions
                        with respect to the Yunnan section of the French Indochina–Yunnan Railway
                        over which Chinese authorities have recently assumed control. The Committee
                        is desirous of obtaining from the Chinese some indication or admission that
                        Chinese assumption of control over the Railway is a temporary emergency
                        measure related to prosecution of the war, that French interests in the
                        Railway will be respected and protected, and that the post-war status of the
                        Railway will be subject of discussion between the Chinese Government and the
                        Government of France to be established.</p>
                    <p>The Department suggests that you consult with the head of the French
                        Committee in Chungking to ascertain the character of the Chinese
                        Government’s response to any approach he may have made; and that, if the
                        response of the Chinese Government was not of a nature so flatly negative as
                        to preclude any apparent usefulness in pursuing the matter, you choose a
                        suitable opportunity, preferably incidental to the discussion of other
                        matters, to inquire of the Foreign Office in regard to the French
                        Indochina–Yunnan Railway. You should limit yourself to an expression of
                        interest and not make any direct request for clarification in support of the
                        French approach. It is hoped that your expression of interest may in some
                        measure result in exerting the influence which the French desire in support
                        of their approach.</p>

                    <p>1777. Sino-French relations. 1. Opportunity arose September 21 in

                        2. Dr. Wu gave a lengthy exposition along the lines of our 1613, September
                            1,<note n="2" xml:id="d806fn2">Not printed.</note> except that he
                        indicated that the Chinese Government definitely desires that Coiffard<note n="3" xml:id="d806fn3">Jacques Coiffard, Chief of (Free) French Civil
                            Delegation at Chungking.</note> be replaced. He said that the Chinese
                        Government had a whole-hearted desire to maintain the most friendly
                        relations and to collaborate with the French National Committee and that
                        confidentially the Chinese Government was selecting a French and English
                        speaking Chinese of prestige to be stationed in Algiers. He said that in
                        taking over administration of the railway the Chinese Government had been
                        motivated upon the breaking of relations with Vichy by considerations
                        relating to Indochina, the attitude to which in AOF [apparent garble] whose
                        governor (Decoux) was in doubt; that the Chinese action was of course a
                        temporary war time measure; and that no question had been raised as to
                        ownership of the railway. He said that the seizure of the hospital was a bad
                        mistake and that the Central Government had issued strict orders for its
                        return to the French and also for full protection of French nationals and
                        rights. He said that the Chinese authorities liked Peckhoff, head of
                        military delegation, and Laurin, deputy chief of the civil delegation, and
                        the Foreign Office was continuing to discuss matters with them.</p>
                    <p>Our conversation was on a quite personal and private basis and accordingly in
                        response to an indirect inquiry whether the Department had taken cognizance
                        of the situation, I said that we had received some inquiry from Washington,
                        and that as indicated in statements in connection with the limited
                        recognition of the French Committee our Government was of course interested
                        in the same friend in that it had an interest in all of its Allies and
                        friends and was especially interested in the maintaining and increasing of
                        unity and friendship among the United Nations and the Allies for the
                        prosecution of the war which was the principal task of all. Dr. Wu repeated
                        his assurances several times and I told him that when the Chinese
                        representative to Algiers was appointed we would be glad to inform our
                        people there in regard to him in the hope of facilitating the establishment

                        September 22. According to the newly appointed Chinese director of the
                        Yunnan railway, all the former French officials and employees (numbering 35)
                        have been removed but American employees, many of whom are locomotive
                        engineers, et cetera, are being retained. He states that some of the French
                        wish to proceed to North Africa and some to Indochina but that while Chinese
                        Government is agreeable to their going to Africa it will not permit any to
                        go to the latter place. As regards the future he states that he “supposes”
                        the Chinese “will have to pay something” to the French for the railway
                        “sometime”.</p>

                        1942, China, page 762</ref>. In April and May, 1943 the question of
                    recognizing a Korean Provisional Government was discussed by the Chinese
                    Ambassador at the Department of State. He was informed that the Department
                    envisaged an independent Korea after the war but that the matter of recognition
                    had better rest in abeyance for the time being. The Ambassador said the Chinese
                    view also favored letting the matter rest. In a despatch from Chungking on
                    August 20, the Chargé reported a conversation with General Wang Peng-sheng,
                    adviser to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, in which the latter stated that the
                    question of recognizing a Korean Provisional Government was merely one aspect of
                    a much greater problem affecting the future not only of Korea but also areas in
                    southeastern Asia occupied by the Japanese. He urged the calling of a conference
                    of the interested United Nations to formulate policy in this regard.</p>
